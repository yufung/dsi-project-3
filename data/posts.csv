t3_ch9tcj,Claims are now being accepted for the 2017 Equifax breach - you could receive $125 or more.,"[Settlement website](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/)

[Eligibility checker](https://eligibility.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/en/eligibility)

[FTC.gov press release](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement)

You can receive a minimum of $125, more if you had to spend time freezing your credit or suffered financial losses. Claims are open until January.

Edit: there seems to be some confusion on being eligible for the cash settlement if you ""don't have credit monitoring"". I assume most readers here have something like Credit Karma, which is free and does indeed provide credit monitoring.

t3_chiqei,Are there any downside to putting a claim for the 2017 Equifax breach?,"I just found out that we can put a claim in regarding the Equifax breach.

Although (that i know of) me, my mom, and my brother wasn't directly affected through ID theft, we spent hours and months keeping a monitor on our accounts. as well as doing the free account freezes (since we didnt want to pay them again for the paid freeze services.... which just sounded dumb to us)

So i would love to file a claim against them for both my mom and brother, and for myself.

t3_chpzag,$102k in credit card/consumer debt after dealing with depression/family emergency/living above our means. Temporarily stop 401(k) contributions to pay aggressively pay down debt?,"Hi all,

So yeah, we've learned our lesson the hard way and the guilt I feel is immense.  This has been a huge eye opener for us, and my fiance and I sat down and looked at our finances a few weeks ago and were wondering how in the hell we got here.  We determined we were living above our means, and have since made some adjustments to cut back after working out some mental health issues that were really causing me issues. We moved to a cheaper apartment, sold one of our vehicles, and overall and trying to be more conscious of where our money is going.

Now, we're wondering if it makes sense to temporarily stop our 401(k) contributions to aggressively tackle this debt.  We'd be losing out on our employer match, but I think given the interest we're paying on some of these cards/loan, and just the ability to pay these down faster and have the peace of mind, it may be worth it.. plus I'm sick if paying these minimums.

Below are some stats

Ages: 27, 29

Combined annual income: \~178k base (with about an additional $10k in year-end bonuses).

Monthly net income (assuming no 401(k) contribution, but still includes our health insurance): \~$9,690

Living expenses:

Rent: $1590 (recently moved to a cheaper place, down from $2700.. we're in a very HCOL area)

Utilities: \~$175 (internet, gas, electricity, trash, etc)

Subscriptions: \~$65 (netflix, spotify, game subscriptions)

&amp;#x200B;

Now for our debts:

Total credit card minimum payments: \~$1,700 (total C.C. amount \~$72k)

Payoff loan: \~$1,194  (total loan remaining \~$30k)

Disneyland passes (can't cancel these against Disney policy, unfortunately, and have ab out 6 more months on them): \~$207

Tesla loan: $783 @ 3% (We were previously driving nearly 65 miles a day, the gas savings alone made this move make sense.  We were saving \~$350 a month in gas). We still car pool to work everyday. We owe $48,400 on it currently.. I estimate it's worth about $52-$54k.

Insurance: \~$130 via Metromile (cheapest we can find)

Stipend to parents: \~$500.  This is a temporarily thing, but my parent's have been through a lot recently and have done right by me my entire life.  My mom lost her job, dad doesn't earn much, and it's been really hard for her, so we're helping out until she's back on her feet for the next year or two).

&amp;#x200B;

Living expenses

Food + household items: \~$350 goal.

Pet food, supplies: \~50

Vacation budget: $0.. we're not going anywhere right now.

Hobbies: $0, ideally we want to keep things tight right now. Maybe we could add a line item for discretionary monthly spending so we're not miserable.. but then again, maybe we should be considering where we are.

Any help would be great.. thank you.",personalfinance

So instead if following the email link, I called the customer support line and after some back and forth, they said there was no new sign-in *phew* but that they do send out emails like that occasionally to old customers to get them to re-sign-up. Which I find... suspicious... that they send emails posing as potential fraud/hack notifications to get you to re-open an account with then. 

Question is, should I mark that message traffic as spam/ fraud and keep an eye on my bank account for suspicious activity, or can I take this confirmation of strange business practice as legit?

t3_cgyf7l,"Paying attention to my 401k saved my company's employees ~$92,000","This is a post about how even a little bit of attention can go a long way for you, and others. 

I work for a company with ~600 employees across North America. Since finding the personal finance communities two years ago, my family has been keeping an eye on our budgeting and saving, and I was having fun with it, so I started also keeping track of contributions into my 401k - nothing major, just a yearly look to see contributions, matches (my company matches 4%), and dividends.

One year I logged into my 401k provider (Fidelity) and ran my transaction history total for a year, and what caught my eye was a Fee for $12.50. To that date I had never seen a fee before. I called my HR/Benefits and they confirmed they had jumped the gun but that - starting next year - every employee would have a $12.50 recordkeeping fee charged yearly. They reimbursed me the $12.50 for that year, but I learned a lesson: 401ks (and the HR departments behind a company) were not infallible.  I added 'Fees' to my mental thing to check on during my year-end check.

2 years went by, until this last year. This year in February I pulled the 2018 totals for my 401k, and noticed that my contribution and my year-end total seemed off, by about $150 or so. I couldn't figure it out. Finally, I went to the transaction history of my 401k and looked through it. And there I saw it: a company **match** of *negative* $153.95, back in March. It was the strangest thing! It wasn't tied to any actual contribution; it was just sitting out there, all by itself. It wasn't even listed under 'Fees'. It was just a *negative* company match. (Shout out to everyone who has ever complained about their company match or lack thereof - at least you've never had a *negative* one!) And I knew it wasn't just those dollars I was missing - it was all those dollars that those dollars were going to make, and the dollars *those* dollars would make, for decades to come. 

I started asking around. My HR department said there were no reported problems and that if I wanted a detailed walkthrough of my 401k contributions, I could wait two weeks until I had a meeting with the benefits coordinator. I said, 'Schedule it'. But I didn't stop there. I started asking my coworkers, and guess what - *everyone* had a negative company match on that date. I had 5 confirmed cases, then 10, then 20. The amounts all varied, but it was always on the same March date. 

By this point I got enough people riled up that I ended up talking to the head of Benefits, who confirmed that, okay, maybe there was a problem. It took 2 months for them to confirm, at which point we found out that a payroll 'true-up' calculation had incorrectly counted a week that crossed from year-to-year as two weeks, and then had automatically 'corrected' for the doubled amount. It took 2 more months for them to finally correct it. I'm sure some of my coworkers contribute less and some contribute way more, but 600 employees * $153.95 = $92,370.  Meaning that every person in the company had a hand in some $92000 missing from their 401k... but I was the only one who had bothered to check. 

I know most people don't ever calculate out their paycheck or look at their 401k. And I'm not saying you should on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. But every once in a while, take 5 or 10 minutes and grab that paper copy of your paycheck, or hit that 'Forgot password' button, log on to your system, and take a little look over how much money you're getting - be it paycheck, 401k, or whatever - and see whether it makes sense to you. You might be surprised what you find.

t3_chp520,Equifax: What if claims exceed settlement amount?,"It would take only ~~5~~ 3 million claims for the $125 voucher to reach the settlement amount of ~~$700~~  $380.5 Million ($125 Million will be added if claims exceed this amount for out-of-pocket expenses).   What if claims exceed the settlement amount?  Do claims for actual damages take precedent over options 1 and 2?  I'm beginning to wonder if taking the free credit monitoring is the most valuable option assuming that the claims will far exceed the settlement amount.  Does anyone have any resources on how this works?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: If i'm reading this FAQ correctly, then the settlement isn't even for $700 million;

&amp;#x200B;

Equifax will pay at least $380,500,000 into a Consumer Restitution Fund. The Consumer Restitution Fund will be used to:

* Make cash payments for Out-of-Pocket Losses and Time Spent (see [**FAQ 7**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-7));
* Purchase Credit Monitoring Services (see [**FAQ 8**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-8));
* Pay cash Alternative Reimbursement Compensation to Settlement Class Members who already have their own credit monitoring or identity protection coverage before making a claim (see [**FAQ 10**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-10));
* Make cash payments for Subscription Product Reimbursement;
* Purchase Restoration Services for all Settlement Class Members, regardless of whether they make a claim (see [**FAQ 11**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-11));
* Pay the costs of notifying Settlement Class Members and administering the settlement;
* Pay service awards to the Settlement Class Representatives, as approved by the Court (see [**FAQ 22**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-22));
* Pay attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses, as approved by the Court (see [**FAQ 21**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-21)).

&amp;#x200B;

If the Consumer Restitution Fund is used up, Equifax will pay up to an additional $125,000,000 to pay Out-of-Pocket Losses (see [**FAQ 13**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-13)).

t3_chj0ge,Where Should I Prioritize Savings?,"For someone graduating college soon and looking where I should prioritize my investments, what do you guys think of this list of priorities? Would you switch any of these around, or add anything different? I am lucky enough to have no debt at all, so I'm leaving off any section on paying off high interest debt with this.

**1) Emergency Fund**

* should cover three to six months expenses
* keep in high interest savings account (2% or higher yield)


**2) Employer Sponsored Retirement Plan (401k, 403b, 457, etc.) Match**

* max out the employer match completely; this is usually a few percent
* ~~VCIT~~ VFINX for stocks (90%) and VCIT for bonds (10%) if possible; if not, go for low fees and a broad fund


**3) Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA’s)**

* a Roth IRA is usually better when younger and in a lower tax bracket
* max out the allowed contribution (currently $6000 per year)
* can invest anywhere, so the best ones are 70% in VTSAX for US stocks, 20% in VTIAX for international stocks, and 10% in VTBLX for bonds


**4) Health Savings Accounts (HSA’s)**

* provided you have a high deducible plan
* generally, it is a good idea to max out the allowed amount ($3500 for an individual, per year and $7000 for a family, per year)
* it uses pre-tax income, and is withdrawn tax-free, provided it is used for health expenses
* it grows tax-deferred
* considered an “above the line” deduction for taxes
* if not used by age 65, can either use it for health expenses normally, or any expenses (if used for regular expenses, the money gets taxes, but not penalized, when withdrawn; if used for regular expenses, this is just like a normal IRA
* consider this a retirement account, making a separate budget for medical expenses, and saving the medical receipts to cash out when needed
* invest in ~~VCIT~~ VFINX for stocks (90%) and VCIT for bonds (10%)


**5) Finish Maxing the 401K**

* after taking advantage of a company match, a more versatile IRA, and a HSA that offers more of a tax break (provided you use it for medical expenses), go back to your 401K and finish maxing it out at $19,000 per year
* hopefully your company offers a good fund with low expenses (same distribution and funds as discussed in your company match section)


**7) Real Estate**

* this is not for everyone, and is more hands on, but is a great way to build wealth and diversify after maxing your retirement accounts
* save up a down payment for a single family home or multifamily home (or whatever you decide to focus on) using a high yield savings account or safe investment


**8) Taxable Investment Accounts**

* depending on your situation, you may want to put this above, or instead of, real estate investing, as it's a little simpler
* there are no restrictions on income, when you can take out the money, etc. for taxable brokerage accounts; this makes it a great option for a bridge account
* suggested portfolio is 70% in VTSAX, 20% in VTIAX, and 10% in VTBLX",personalfinance

That said, I've always been good about my retirement savings. I'm 50 years old.  I put away 15% post-tax into a Roth 401k, and my current savings (retirement + some non-retirement savings) is over 8 times my salary, which, from what I have learned from various financial websites, is really good for my age.

&amp;#x200B;

My budget doesn't have a lot of leeway while I continue to put 15% post-tax into retirement and I have a year left of car payments. I have more options once my car is paid off next year, but still below the median rent for the region.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I'm 50. When they tell you that the most important savings years are when you're younger, the corollary seems to be that the money you put in in your 50s won't grow as much. So, given my generally good retirement account situation, I'm considering scaling back my retirement contributions.

&amp;#x200B;

Another option is to find a roommate situation somewhere. I don't really want to do it (I've grown quite accustomed to being independent) but I have two different friends that have reached out to me saying that they have, or will have in the near future, a room for rent. And honestly they both seem like guys that I'd get along with as roommates.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, just because the building is on the market doesn't mean that I'll be forced out any time soon; so I can always hope that my rent situation won't change anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do people think?

t3_chol95,Saving and Retirement Questions. (26yrOld),"Hello!

Here is my situation and I am looking for guidance on what to do from this point on.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 26 years old and married. We keep our finances completely separate and split bills to even it out. So essentially I am saving for retirement on my own (she is also). I make 50K a year and put 10% of my biweekly check into 401K which equals 15% after company match. I have roughly 15K in a savings account for saving. This is not touched by expenses.

Here are my questions:

1. How much do I need in that savings account? 6 months of income?
2. I only have a 401K. Should I open an IRA or something for more retirement saving? What is the best option for me regarding my age?
3. I also have about 8K left on an auto loan. Is it worth using some of the savings to pay that off now or just wait? The interest was only like $900 of the 17K loan.

That is all I can think of for now. If you made it this far, thank you for taking time out of your day to possibly help me out. I try to be as financially smart as I can although I do need some guidance.

t3_chogdg,How is this budget for being a college student?,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

&amp;#x200B;

How is this budget for being a college student? I am currently enrolled full-time at a community college going for IT, and while I am busy with school, I want to cement my spending habits in stone as soon as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I've come up with a budget for my next year of living, could anyone please look at this and suggest room for improvement?

&amp;#x200B;

**The following numbers will be displayed in CPM(cost per month)**

*College Tuition: ($1800 a semester)Covered*

*Rent: $440 a month(covered)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Income per month:**

*One part time job: $****620*** *per month*

**My personal budget:**

**Mandatory Payments:**

*Internet: $11*

*Electric: $30*

*Heat: $35*

*Food: $160*

**Total: $236 a month**

&amp;#x200B;

**Non-mandatory payments:**

*Gym: $60 a month*

*Coffee: $30 per month*

*Eating Out: $50 per month*

*Misc Expenses: $50 per month*

**Total: $190 per month**

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me with **$194** a month as ""savings"". 

I plan on investing 10% of my income into a Roth IRA, so I'd have **around $132** a month saved

&amp;#x200B;

Any ways I could improve this? As far as the **non-mandatory expenses** go, I put VERY high numbers on that. I don't eat out at all right now, so that could effectively go to $0, and I have misc expenses down at $50 just to have a buffer of any random things I want to spend.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fortunate enough to be able to live car-free in my situation, and my school offers a free public transit pass. I do plan on getting a higher paying part time job, and possibly getting a second job. I would not be able to stay out of debt if I was to own a car, and honestly I do not plan on owning one unless I would absolutely need one.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on improvements? I'm not necessarily worried about the actual dollars at this point, but rather the habits that I can carry over to when I get a full time job after school.

t3_chqjkr,Saving up for next year's max IRA contribution?,"I opened an IRA in January of this year for the first time and contributed the full amounts for both 2018 and 2019 at that point because I had the savings to do so, and based on advice found on this sub generally wanted to maximize time in the market. I thought at that point in time that it would make sense for me to start saving $500/month so that when Jan 2020 comes around I will have enough to max my contribution early for that year as well. I am realizing now however that this may not be the optimal solution as the money I am saving throughout the year is just sitting in a HYSA instead of spending time in the market.

At the end of the day I guess my main question is does it make sense for me to save up money throughout this year in order to max out my IRA contribution in January of next year?

Would it be more worth it if I was putting it into a taxable brokerage account instead of just an HYSA?

Or am I better off just making monthly contributions to my IRA throughout the year with the money I was previously saving?

1. Plan to use the proceeds from the sale of our current home to pay for the down payment on the new house  Depending on timing this may require us to put in an offer on contingency which I know puts us at a disadvantage.  We definitely will have more than enough to cover a 20% down payment, realtors' fees and closing costs once the current house sells.
2. Spend the next few years saving up enough to cover down payment + closing costs on the new house so we don't have to worry about the timing of current house selling first, etc.  We would need to save about $100k for this to be on the safe side, so about $2800/mo for the next few years which we could really only achieve by reducing our retirement contributions.  We would probably just go down to contributing 9% of my husband's salary so he could still get his full company match and divert the rest toward savings.  We have about $660k in retirement investments right now and we are both 35 so we are ahead of the curve and were planning for an early retirement so this would slow that down but maybe worth it?

t3_chk0lg,Buying a cheap condo outright VS renting &amp; investing savings,"I made a throwaway because I don't want to discuss my finances on my regular account.

So I'm a very lucky young (26m) professional. Between my own savings from my old jobs and inheritance money, plus money my parents put aside for me, I currently have almost 450k (CAD) that I can spend on my future. Which is... Ridiculous at my age. And I'm a little overwhelmed.

I live in Toronto (I guess that's worth disclosing), where the housing market is a little fucked, and a low-to-okay condo will run you at least 350k-400k+. Rent for a one bedroom condo is anywhere between $1500 to $2000+.

Now my actual question is whether it seems like a good idea to buy a condo with all my savings (around 400k-500k) OR find somewhere with reasonably cheap rent ($1000-$1700/month, depending on if I have roommates) and invest the \~450k CAD banked, ideally aiming for 5% yield on investment per year (but not guaranteed) through stocks and the like.

My instinct (and my parents' instincts, and others), is that it makes the most sense to buy now since I'll have virtually no mortgage if I get a cheapy place, but when I run the numbers I get a bit more confused, because it seems like I could make more money by investing (assuming I could consistently make \~5%/year) and renting.

For slightly more concrete numbers, lets say I manage to get a place $1500/month rent (could be higher or lower, but around there). And let's say I invest the $400k I have now at 5% per year, and for simplicity's sake assume I don't add money. Over 10 years I'd net \~$652k total banked, and 25 years I'd net \~$1.354m total banked from the \~400k invested. And rent would cost me $180k for 5 years, and $450k for 25 years (assuming rent didn't go up a ton, which is a huge assumption). With these numbers, it looks like after 10 years of renting &amp; investing the 400k, I'd have $472k and after 25 years I'd have $904k banked from to 400k invested, after subtracting rent costs. Whereas if I bought I would only have the condo to show for it, which could go up in value but probably not as much, and that's hard to say for sure.

Also this isn't even to mention that if I bought a condo I'd have maintenance fees of $300-$700 per month, which is a massive cost per year even if I DO own the place. So really it seems like buying is much worse in the long term than renting &amp; investing @ 5% per year (assuming I can uphold that).

Thoughts? I know this is a lot of word vomit, this is just kind of stuff that I've been confused about for a while, and it seems like my parents and friends don't understand why I'm even considering renting &amp; investing. Everyone seems to think as soon as you have the down payment money you should just go for it, which seems stupid to me. But perhaps it's worth it for me to buy a place if I won't have a mortgage.

Thanks for reading.

I've already worked my position on a temporary contract basis for a few years, and I'm being converted to a permanent role. The situation's doubly confusing to me because it's in a weird area between a promotion (no negotiation in my company) and a new offer (lots of negotiation). I've already completed my interviews, and I have a meeting set up with my current/hiring manager next week to talk about my conversion. I'd like to go into that meeting with a good game plan.

Some facts about the situation:

* Job prereqs: the job is in R&amp;D and has 4 levels. Non-PhD candidates usually start in level 1-2 depending on experience. PhD candidates start in level 2-3. I have a masters, plus 3 years of experience working here. I meet the prereqs for both levels 1 and 2.

* Pay: the pay is according to set pay bands, but there's no corporate requirements for where in the pay band a new hire starts. My current pay puts me at 30th percentile in the level 1 band, and 8th percentile in the level 2 band. My manager confirmed a pay raise when I convert.

* Responsibilities: Level 1 is a more junior role which expects some troubleshooting on projects, reporting, but not much else. Level 2 expects more independent research ideas and control over projects. My current work consists of unofficial leading a few projects but assisting roles on others; the plan is to officially lead my unofficial projects within a couple years after my conversion.

* Corporate timelines: Generally promotion from one level to the next takes at least 3-5 years. Changes this year have hard-capped the number of promotions though, so they're expected to become much harder now compared to the past.

* Hiring mood at HR: word is that due to the low unemployment rate and general trouble attracting young people to this company, offers for new grad hires have them starting at higher than people who's been working here for ~5 years. To me, this translates to them starting at at least 30-50th percentile of the pay bands. 

* My supervisor (a level 4) supports me hiring into level 2. I do not yet have a gauge on my manager's opinion.

* I don't expect an official offer to come from HR for at least a couple weeks. My meeting with my manager next week will likely be before seeing an offer.

Unless more has already been decided on the HR side than I'm aware of, I should be able to negotiate for both a job level and salary. I'm just now sure what my approach should be and which one to prioritize if I have to pick. 

* Do I focus on a ""I meet exceed/meet requirements"" direction?

* Or ""compare me to a new hire"" direction?

* Since the paybands have tons of overlap, do I prioritize arguing for more pay regardless of job title, or job title first and foremost? The difference in max allowed salary between the two levels is 20k, so starting in the lower one would cap me faster and promotions may take a long time. But my performance evals would likely be much better since I already exceed the requirements for that level.

* Do I even bring up salary at the meeting next week or wait until I see an official offer?

* How aggressively do I pursue this? Both in how high of a salary I ask for, and what language I use to communicate how firm I feel about my number. I like working here, and I'm not interviewing anywhere else. Realistically I'd accept their offer regardless, but a worse offer would tempt me to look elsewhere faster (I assume I don't say this. Or imply this?). My manager and supervisor both have acknowledged that they're committed to getting me to stay longterm so I have some leverage, but I don't want to seem ungrateful either. Not sure the latter is a valid concern? I know the typical advice is ""the worst they can do is say no"" but we're all emotionally invested by this point so there's bound to be some more subjective feelings involved than a new job negotiation.

* Anything else I should consider to argue my case? Or going against me that I should try to mitigate?

t3_chq06s,"Should I be selling my car to CarMax for a cheaper, more economical car?","I am trying to clean up unnecessary expenses due to an unexpected hospitalization visit, and would like some advise/recommendation. I have a plan in mind, but I just want to confirm that I'm going about it the right way.  

My current car is a financed 2010 G37. NADA values it at around ~$10,700, and I owe about $8,500. Monthly car expenses (this can vary depending on the mileage driven) are as follows:  

* $250 monthly loan  
* $210 insurance  
* $180 gas  

I like cars. It's the main reason I bought it, but at this point, I am absolutely fed up with the terrible efficiency (15 miles/gallon).  


Income is about $3000/month. Other expenses are about $1500/month. This includes rent, student loans, groceries and other utilities. I have about $10k in savings, which the rest of the income goes to. I have no credit debt or any other debt.  

My plan is to sell the car and buy a 2008-2009 Honda Fit or other similar cars for about $3,000 out of my savings. My car needs about $1,000 in maintenance pretty soon (brakes, a broken sensor and oil changes). I currently have it up for sale for $10,200, and have received an offer from CarMax for $8,800 which is valid for the next 7 days. If I sell it privately, I'll have to take care of the maintenance, but CarMax will take it as is.

t3_chph1m,Drowning and desperate,"Hi, all.

Just a little backstory: I (24/F) live with my husband (36), mother in law (60+) and my father in law (70+). We also have two kids (2 and 1) and we’re pregnant with another baby. My mother and father in law do not work, but they get monthly social security which is about $2200. I work full time making between $900-$1000 every two weeks. My husband is on long term disability working towards total disability and makes approximately $2000 a month. In total, we bring in roughly $6200, give or take.


We just got news that my husband’s long term disability claim was cancelled even though his medical appointments are outrageous, close to 8-10 a week. We are terrified for that loss of income.

Now, we make good money combined but we also all have poor spending habits. My mother and father in law love pawn loans and payday loans and more often than not have 3-4 going at any given time. Rather than pay any off, they keep renewing them.  My husband and I are just plain dumb financially speaking. We don’t do things intelligently and are always behind on bills, not to mention we are deep in debt and trying to file bankruptcy.

What are some little things we can do to start making things easier on ourselves? We’re desperate for any types of advice that we may not have thought of or just need to be reminded of.",personalfinance

t3_chpel5,Questions about a driving job reimbursement,"So I recently took a job that is to drive a kid from his house, to an appointment, I’m free for 3 hours, and then from the appointment back home. 5 days a week. Round trip this is 40 miles including driving back to my house. I think it’s valid to include the driving to my house due to the nature of the job. You can’t just pay me for the 15 minutes of driving from point A to point B here. When I took the job they had not yet given me the addresses so it was impossible to figure how much to charge. 

When I took the job they said it was 5-10 minutes to drop him off. It’s closer to 15 minutes, but it takes me a total of an hour out of my day 2 x a day to do the job. We agreed on an extra $5 a day for mileage, which I now know is not nearly enough. I calculated from the IRS mileage reimbursement rate of $0.58 per mile, mileage reimbursement should be $23.20 minus the $5 already given. 

I’m being compensated $35 a day including the $5 for mileage. Any thoughts or recommendations on how to bring this up? I communicate with the family via text, they’re not there for pick ups or drop offs. The grandmother is there watching the kid. I like the family and don’t want to do this in the wrong way. They’re planning on paying me more when they need more childcare, in September at a rate of $20 per hour, which is what we originally agreed upon. Although I know I’m not currently making that because it takes much longer than anticipated to complete the job. But if we address the mileage concerns, I would be more than happy.

I recently accepted a written offer to a new position that I will be starting in the near future. When I initially received the verbal offer from my soon-to-be manager, they stated the 401k match would be a full match up to a certain %. However, upon receiving the written offer, it was a partial percentage equaling a lower match (about a $2K/year difference). I knew that it was less than initially discussed but I didn't fully process the difference due to my excitement/adrenaline at the time and was just plain excited to accept the offer as a whole - so I went ahead and signed.

t3_chp8jh,Multiple hard pulls for same loan.,"Hey folks. I'm struggling with interpreting what is and isn't allowed with my credit in this situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the deal. Last fall, I signed a contract for solar panels. I did the loan application then, to qualify for the install. Install did not happen until spring (due to weather). Since the install was more than 6 months since the last pull, they told me I would have to do a new credit pull. Irritating, as I was in the middle of a name change at the time. I filled out the new application and provided my current IDs, where I had my new name on my social security card, and the in-the-process-of-being-renewed-drivers-license with my old name. The application was stalled due to the discrepancy. I submitted documentation of the name change, etc., and was assured there wouldn't be two hard pulls that day because they were in the same business day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Surprise - there were two hard pulls. I wrote requesting they fix this before I pursue options through the credit agencies. I was given statements like, ""we're still looking into it"" repeatedly through the next two months. In the meantime, my loan was sold to a new credit union, placing yet another hard pull on my credit. I wrote to the original loan holders with a request for information regarding what steps had been taken between each step of the emails stating they were looking into it, whether they were federally or state chartered, whether the credit union my loan was sold to was federally or state chartered, what U.S. states any maintenance or activities on my account have taken place in, and where was I notified of another hard pull to sell my loan. I have not received a response. **I now have 4 hard pulls on my credit for this singular solar loan, dropping my credit score 90 points.** Two seems somewhat acceptable due to the 6 month window of time between pull and servicing of the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan was to finance about $10k of this through a pre-approved loan, but after talking to Bank of America because the dealership I'm buying from isn't just a FORD dealer, I can't get the regular auto-loan rate of like 3.5% and would have to get a private party rate of more like 6%. (I'd also get a 0.5% reduction for platinum preferred status).

I have great credit of 800, no other debt, so I was assuming that financing for a rate of 3-4% wouldn't be a bad call and I could keep my cash reserves while keeping a pretty low car payment. Now that I'm looking at closer to 6% though I'm debating on if I should just take the leap and pay all cash? Also, are there other banks or credit unions that would offer me more of a traditional loan rate for this type of dealer, or is that pretty typical for a place that specializes in just a wide range of used cars?

t3_chp5iz,Mortgage vs. Daycare,"Hello PF!

Some background: My husband is a CNC Machinist at his dad’s shop and I work in Human Resources for a small community bank. We have a 2 year old son and a baby girl on the way. We are currently living with his dad to save as much as we can because we want to build our own home. We already have land to build said home on. 

Advice needed: We are considering having me staying home once our daughter is born. We are currently paying $800 in daycare (I know this is apparently very cheap, we live in rural North Carolina). However with the birth of our daughter we would be paying double, so $1600 a month. That is completely insane to me as we could start paying for a mortgage with that money. 

I have no bills. I usually just pay our phone bill ($100 and groceries.). We recently paid off all of my debt, just a personal loan I had taken out last year. The only real debt we have is my husband’s truck that’s is financed. 

My husband doesn’t know if it’s a good idea for me to stop working and have the mortgage payment work out and us barely scraping by. 

I’ll break down our expenses below and see if anyone has any advice or experiences with your partner being a SAHM(D). 

Truck payment: $360/month

Insurance: $200/month 

Groceries: $250/month

Phones: $100/month 

Daycare: $800/month (can be cut out if I stop working)

Gas: $120/month(could be slashed in half if I stop working)

We don’t pay for any utilities right now because we live with his dad. Once we build we would only really pay for electric as we would have well water. 

My husband makes about $4,000 a month. I make about $1600 a month which would be what we pay in daycare a month. Breaking even with that doesn’t make sense to me. He thinks we are going to struggle. I feel like we can do this. Especially because I’m ready to start building our home and have our own space.

Our current balance is $241k and change. We are refinancing to a 4% rate and a new balance of $244,500 on a 30-yr fixed. House originally purchased October 2018. Our current note is $1,651.92.


So the first time we contacted the lender they estimated our new note to be ~$1,492, with cash to close at $4,400 (covers closing and upfront PMI).

We’re supposed to be closing tomorrow, but Wednesday evening the lender sends us the closing disclosure and it shows a new note of ~$1,531 and $5k cash to close. So I called and complained because this seemed like drastic increases. The lender agreed to look into it yesterday. 

After a while, he told me that they were able to keep our close date on Friday, and got the new note lowered all the way to ~$1,460, and back down to $4,400 cash to close. This seemed suspiciously low to me, since our monthly escrow was at $289/mo. Our homeowners insurance is $1,570, and our flood is $570.

Apparently our property taxes did not get reassessed yet, and we are paying what the previous owner paid for property taxes. We filed a homestead exemption, and were assessed $27.4k, with a savings of about $870 in property taxes. Please note I’m not entirely sure what those numbers mean, nor do, on our homestead exemption.

I called the title company to confirm with them that we won’t run into an escrow shortage at the end of the year and have to cough up money to cover it or have our note increase. They confirmed that the current amount in the escrow on the CD is correct, but if the property taxes do get reassessed, which they will, we will have a shortage.

Basically, I’m not sure how to proceed from here. Should I tell our lender that we want the property taxes estimated to what they believe it will be after a reassessment? If that’s the case, I believe we will get a check back with the overage amount at the end of the year since we were overpaying for taxes that haven’t gone up yet.

And along with an increase in tuition (~$600). This is such a big increase in cost that I didn’t think about. To those who may ask aren’t international students rich? Yeah I may have a decent of money but the money is from my mom and dad working their whole live while living in a 8m x8m apartment to give me a good education. It’s my family’s life long saving and I am willing save and take every penny I possibly can. 

Onto the second point in my title, I managed to get a state insurance that would cover me much more than the school insurance. Nevertheless, they still wouldn’t take the charge off. The state Insurance has a policy, which I don’t know if it applies to me, that they would purchase my school insurance if I waive it. I believe that mean the state insurance will ultimately enroll me in the school insurance. But I don’t know if that’s going to work.",personalfinance

If I were to sell a stock and earn short term capital gains and then I repurchase the same stock within the next 30 days and hold it, would this be considered for the wash sale rule?

t3_chop4o,(FL) Title Loan for a car that's now mechanically totaled. Do I still owe? What do I do?,"On the verge of homelessness and desperation, I took out a title loan against the only real object of value I had - my car. I got just enough from it for first and last for an apartment that I needed.
At the time, my income provided more than enough means to resolve the issue, and I'd been paying it down as quickly as I've been able to because I know the financial trap of these loans.

Unfortunately, I believe my car's flywheel shattered. (I drive stick, and this component allows the car to get into, and out of gear).

While (mostly?) mechanically sound - it does start - it does not run. I'm paying for additional comprehensive coverage through the loan (per required, in case of accident) - but I was told it would be anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 to replace the part depending on what other components were damaged (Clutch, etc).

I'm going over my loan documentation and do not see anything in it that covers mechanical failure (enough to warrant the car undrivable) that would end the contract, or would assist me in any way in paying for the vehicle's repairs. 

To make this worse, it was my primary method of transportation to work - and it's failure had rendered me jobless. With what little savings I've managed to hang onto (Thanks, PersonalFinance!) - I've instead now budgeted for survival instead. 

My payment is coming up, and if there's a way to just rid myself of this mess (even at the expense of my credit), I'd love your thoughts.

t3_chom03,"Took a pay cut to keep my job, manager hired a new employee at a higher salary?","My company had some changes and asked all of us to consider a pay cut in return for less work overall. I agreed, but 7 months later they hired a new person to do the same type of work as us and cover some of the work I would no longer do, since I am paid less.

I'm training this person, and I learned on this person's first paycheck, their 5% employer match is $144, but my 5% match is $122. So I assume this new person must make 18% more money than me no2, right? I suppose there is a chance there was some kind of sign on bonus or their first paycheck was abnormally large?

I don't think it's appropriate to straight up ask the new hire what their salary is, as this is not their problem, and I intended to ask my manager about this. Is the best way just to say I believe the untrained person is compensated at a higher rate than me? do I say this is ""unfair"" or use other language. In truth, I cannot confirm that the new hire understood their paycheck correctly. What if I am wrong, or what if the manager denies paying the new hire more?

So my dad does not want to claim me as a dependent this year. His reasoning is because for the entirety of 2019 so far I have been living at my boyfriend’s house.

I am a student (19) in community college and do not work. My expenses and insurance(car, dental, medical) are covered by my parents. I come to my house for clothes and do laundry. My room is still intact. My mail goes to my parents house and I list it as my residence. Also if I were to breakup with my boyfriend I would move back home. My parents house and the other house are half an hour away from each other, it’s just much more convenient for me to go to my classes without that commute with my current living situation.

I will be applying to transfer to a four year school this year and if I apply as an independent I am concerned that will make my financial aid lower than if I applied as a dependent. My family is considered low income.

I am given a corporate card for these expenses and a budget. I receive 80% of any unused budget at the end in one lump sum.  So if I had $1000 budget and only spent $500 I'd receive $400 at the end. 

For hotels I get $150/day and food is $50. I can easily live under $50/day for food if I grocery shop.

How should I approach this to receive the most money? I'd certainly put the hotels on the corporate card, but should I pay out of pocket for food and receive a larger payment at the end, or am I only hurting myself that way?

2. Relet - I market the apartment, my lease is terminated and I pay $590. New tenant pays application fee only.  They can get a 12 month lease if they rent starting 8/1 but only an 11 month lease if they start on 9/1.

4 Wednesday, 8:57pm: still pending

5 Thursday: 9:48am: no-longer pending

I responded back to the FCC and they never replied back so I never ended up paying the collections

Now a year later, the collections bill resurfaces again. I plan to dispute it again so should I still file a FCC complaint against Comcast for it? And the collections agency wants a written letter if I choose to dispute the debt, so should I inform the collections agency that I intend to report it to the FCC or not even mention it at all?

And is there a time limit to how long a debt can still be claimed? As it's been 2 years already **Edit: looked into it and statute of limitations is 4 years in my state**",personalfinance

t3_chfjgh,Girlfriend working on call hours for less than regular wage,"Just need advice on a sticky situation, please.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend works for a company that requires her to work every other weekend ""on call"" where ""on call"" is her working non-stop from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm on Saturday and Sunday. They pay $60 per day for this extra work. It's all overtime but they're calling it ""on call"".

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks back she had to go into the office to work for some time on a Saturday. When she let them know afterward that she put in 6 hours on site on Saturday they balked and eventually told her she would *not receive pay for these hours worked.* There is no documentation for this. I am considering it lost time/money at this point but it should illustrate how scummy these people are.

&amp;#x200B;

My advice to her was starting tomorrow to let them know she is not comfortable working for the amount they're offering. $60 a day for the amount of work she is performing is under minimum wage. She ends up working 12 days in a row for pennies. My question becomes: if they tell her tough shit, what should she do? We need the money coming in so it's not like we can afford for her to just walk off the job.

t3_chjg7v,Should I buy this house after the inspection came back with some concerns,"House is a new construction townhome, $975k in Seattle area.

Basically, we put in an offer with $10k earnest money 30 days ago to close this Friday (7/26). When we made the offer, it was clear there was plenty of remaining work on the home but both agents assured us the builder had said it could be done in 30 days. Now it's 2 days before closing and we had the third party inspection today. There is a lot of work left (basically everything from 30 days ago that hasn't been touched). And the inspector found more items, however the purchase agreement doesn't have a contingency on fixing the inspection items. The builder told us Monday that whatever is not done by closing and what the inspector finds (within his idea of reason), they will come fix by appointment afterward. However, we're concerned that once the builder has his money, he's not going to do anything about it. At this point, the leftover stuff is thousands of dollars of labor. Instead of making a $975k mistake, should we eat the $10k earnest money and walk away?

Also, there were several contingencies in the earnest money agreement where we requested the garage be painted and the floor coated. Doesn't look like that will be done by Friday. If these things aren't done, could that entitle us to our earnest money back?

Edit: We put in notice at our current apartment and paid to break our lease. That was also expensive ($7k), the first thing I'm going to do once the leasing office opens tomorrow is call and see if there's any way we can stay. However, there are enough of open apartments in the area giving good concessions that we could conceivably move to another apartment and make most of that $7k back.

&amp;#x200B;

So I budgeted for the low-deductible PPO plan which will cost me $215 a month. I know it's a lot, but I need to try seeking therapy for anxiety and depression and this way the appointments are only a $30 copay. I'll reevaluate when my coverage opens up, but if I'm doing weekly or bi-monthly appointments this plan only costs me $15 a month over the high-deductible one once you take those into account.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm not sure about is dental, vision, and all the small things that add up - life insurance, disability insurance, accidental death. Part of me thinks, oh, I'll just add on some low value, it'll probably only add $3 a month or something. Since I'm young, that's actually the case for a lot of it. Dental is either $9 or $13 a month if I get orthodontia insurance, vision is like $2.60 a month.

My question is, how much of this should I be investing in as a young adult? I'm not sure if I should just move $10 a month around and have some pretty solid life insurance or what.

t3_che0d4,Mom was hospitalized with leukemia in May and now my aging parents don't have enough income to pay their bills. I'm managing their finances for the first time. How can I make them comfortable?,"Dad (68yo, Vietnam vet and disabled machinist) and mom (67yo, ill waitress) both receive social security directly deposited into their checking account on the second Wednesday of every month. Dad gets $2005.00 and mom gets $659.00. They live in Pennsylvania.

Until May, this income was supplemented by mom's part time serving job which pulled in $540/mo on average, not including cash tips. This was keeping their heads above water, but now she's hospitalized with acute myeloid leukemia and it's gone, probably permanently.

The current balance in their checking account is $1509.97, which is the remainder of a very generous $2250 grant I was able to procure for them with the help of a social worker. It's a buffer, but it won't last long. September's bills are on the horizon.

I know that I need to reduce their expenses, but I don't know the 'best' way how, or what helpful options are even available to me, if any. I would be so grateful for any experienced guidance. I'm willing to work hard.

Here's the arithmetic:

* **Total combined monthly income: $2664.00**
* **Total combined monthly expenses: $2843.55** [dropping to $2395.72 in November]

**Housing** [$1430.70/mo]

* **Mortgage**: $1230.94/mo [Balance: $103,381.42 @ 5.375%]
* **Home Equity**: $199.76/mo [Balance: $16,201.60 @ 7.39%] -- *Past due $1,195.44 as of 2019/07/24*

**Utilities** [$392.85/mo avg]

* **Oil**: $212.00/mo avg
* **Electric**: $140.39/mo avg
* **Water**: $40.46/mo

**Auto** [$600.54/mo, dropping to $152.71/mo in November]

* **Car payment**: $447.83/mo [Balance: $1306.90 @ 17.59%]
* **Car Insurance**: $142.71/mo
* **AAA Roadside Assistance**: $10.00/mo

**Credit** [$143/mo minimum]

* **Capital One Platinum Mastercard**: $115.00/mo minimum [Balance: $3606.11 @ 25.15%]
* **CareCredit**: $28/mo minimum [Balance: $371.44 @ 26.99%]

**Data/Entertainment** [$276.46/mo avg]

* **Verizon FiOS TV/Internet/Phone Triple Play**: $236.46/mo avg [$320 early term. fee if canceled before 05/06/2021]
* **MetroPCS Cellphone**: $40/mo

How can I be the most effective here? Dad is home alone on the couch most of the time, so canceling his internet and cable television seems so cruel at a time like this, but I acknowledge that might be the first thing that has to go even with that $350 termination fee. After that, I'm just lost.

t3_chbc1c,"Being asked to pay a penalty I don't owe, they claim to keep correcting it but it won't go away","I'll just lay out the facts. This has to do with EZPass, which is a toll thing. 

-I live in NJ. Sometime in April, went through an EZPass toll thing in NY, but the pass apparently didn't scan. 3 weeks later, got a violation notice, please pay toll ($15)

-Go online to pay, but the website wasn't letting me check the box. Tried other browsers and computers, the thing just wasn't allowing me to pay it. Called them instead, they went in and said it was settled now, they charged $15 to the EZPass account, told me I didn't have to do anything.

-At the end of May, got another violation notice saying not only do you still owe $15, you now also owe a $50 late fee. Called them again, spoke to rep and explained everything -- she was confused why the first rep had told me that it was settled because it wasn't. She told me to draft a formal letter to EZPass with $15 enclosed, and explain the circumstances and ask to waive the late fee because it was an error with the website and the initial rep. She made a note in the account explaining all this too. I sent the letter first week of June with the $15 enclosed.

-Early July, I received a collection notice saying that I owe just the $50 penalty now, meaning they received my $15 but didn't read the rest of the letter or circumstances and moved forward with charging me the late fee anyway. Called EZPass and told them everything, they said they informed debt collection agency to waive the fee. It would take 20-30 business days for this to go through.

-Yesterday, July 23rd, got a notice from EZPass saying that I _still_ owe this late fee but they've given me a one-time courtesy offer of paying $25 instead of $50, and if I don't pay by mid-August, I will again owe the full $50. Called EZPass after receiving this letter, and that rep told me that it was all completely settled, including the initial violation and the amount sent to collections, said don't worry about it.

-I went online to check the violation number (on the EZPass violation website) and it was still there, so I was skeptical that this was actually settled. I called EZPass a second time and that rep told me that yes, they received the $15 for the original toll payment, but I still owe the penalty (hah!) and that the $25 was the best they could negotiate based on the facts they have and my letter to them. Supposedly they do have records of all the calls I made to them but they don't see any notes giving any further details (whereas past reps have mentioned that they _have_ added notes... so I'm not sure if they were deleted or removed or ignored or not entered in the first place). 

-They told me if I want to dispute the $25 payment I have to send _another_ letter, and I reiterated that the letters contain the same facts. She said I have to do that anyway, and that as much as they wanted to help, they don't make the decisions: the EZPass Violation Center is separate from the Port Authority that owns EZPass, and the Port Authority is the one that makes all these decisions. But apparently there's no number I can contact, I have to write a letter.

**tl;dr**

Toll pass didn't scan, but I couldn't pay it online so I called them to have it handled there. But the rep that supposedly took care of it didn't, so I am getting hit with a penalty fee that they keep trying to get me to pay even though every time I call they supposedly waive it / take care of it, but it never seems to actually get taken care of.

**My question**:

This is getting pretty ridiculous. What are my options here? I _already_ wrote a letter explaining that I don't owe this thing and instead they just chopped the thing in half.

We haven't heard yet regarding the application - but I was just surfing around on the internet, got a weirdly bad feeling and googled information about taking out loans before closing and basically a ton of websites came up saying it was a hugely bad idea and I am now sitting here losing my ever loving mind thinking we screwed ourselves.

 Am I right or will this not be a huge idea? We don't plan on actually USING the financing card until after closing however we applied for it now because honestly we just got excited and ahead of ourselves. So the card will remain with a 0$ balance on it until after closing. Does this make a difference?

I have about $8k in CC debt (14.15% APR) and theoretically enough to pay it off with my savings ($28k/2.2% interest HYSA) but am much too hesitant to do that because 1) i began my retirement savings far too late (at 35, am 37 now) and because my savings are absolutely ALL i have to fall back on.  

My last job was actually exempt from unemployment so i have some above average anxiety there as i was let go after 9 years. My current job does participate in unemployment luckily, not that i’m particularly concerned about it atm.

Other relative stats. Gross wages - $58K, 1.5 years left on my car lease ($140/month), no other debts.  Single, no kids, live alone in rented apt in an expensive part of the US (northeast) so it’s very difficult to save and is why i have not been able to kill much of the debt on my own thus far.

t3_chmkny,Bank account in another country with zero balance,"Back in 2015 I opened up a debit bank account in Zambia, while I was working there for the year. I used to convert USD into local currency and use it instead of carrying cash with me constantly, and used it for a few online purchases. The plan was to close it when I left the country, but didn't have the time to formally close it. I think i left around $10 in there, and cashed out the rest before I left. I used up most of the remaining balance with an online purchase or 2 in the next year.

I returned there in 2017 on a holiday and tried to see if there was anything left in the account, but I had forgotten the PIN. I took the card to a bank, and they said it was negative with fees and that I had to clear those fees to get it activated again. I didn't have the cash flow to afford these fees (around $30) so I just left it.

I did a credit report earlier this week for the first time in my resident country, and nothing appears to be wrong, and my old bank account isn't mentioned at all.

t3_chkq2y,Help! Trouble getting refunded for cancellation of the Extended Limited Warranty on my automobile,"Reddit, I am here seeking your advice on how to deal with a frustrating situation with Lithia Motors.

I bought a new Mercedes-Benz GLA250 with extended limited warranty in May 2016 from Mercedes-Benz of Beaverton (Lithia is the parent company). The car was financed through Gateway One Lending &amp; Finance (GOLF). Through the course of the term, GOLF sold the loan to a different lender, Regional Acceptance Corporation (RAC).

Now in 2019, in anticipation of selling the car, I decided to cancel the extended limited warranty. Since the extended warranty period hadn't started, I was entitled to receiving the full $2500 refund.

Despite documenting on the warranty cancellation form that RAC were the current lien holder to whom the check needed to be issued, Lithia said that they have to issue the refund check to the original lender and sent it to GOLF. It has been a month now since the refund check was sent to GOLF, but they haven't cashed it, forwarded it to RAC, or returned it to Lithia. Lithia say that in order to issue the refund check to me, they need documentation from GOLF stating that they no longer have any interest in the vehicle (Lien release from GOLF OR Letter on letterhead from GOLF with full VIN stating they have no interest in the vehicle). When I call GOLF customer service representatives, they say they don't own this account any more and cannot help me.

Please guide me on how to get my refund back!",personalfinance

t3_chhiab,"Fell for SSN phone scam, but don't have any credit history/lines of credit...How screwed am I &amp; what should I do? (19 y/o)","I know what you're thinking, I'm an idiot. At around 12:45pm, I received an automated telephone call saying that my social security number was being used to commit crimes in Texas and that if I did not call back there would be a warrant out for my arrest. It gave a number to call, but I just called the number that called me back.

&amp;#x200B;

I got on the phone with a female representative. She seemed to be really nice and just wanting to fix my problems. I explained how I had gotten a call about the suspicious activity with my social security number. She asked which phone it called and I told her the one I was currently calling from. She asked me my first and last name, which I gave to her. Then, she asked my birthday (which I gave to her). Next, she asked me for my social security number. I told her I did not feel comfortable giving that information out over the phone, however, I did give her the last four digits of my SSN. I know I was so fucking stupid and believe me, I'm kicking myself over it. After this, she told me that she was pulling up my file. Once it was pulled up, she continued on to ask me whether or not I had ever visited Texas before and I said yes, I have, however, it was many years ago. As she continued on, I began to get more and more weary about what this lady was saying. So I told her I needed to call my Mom before I did anything. Right after I said that, she promptly hung up...

&amp;#x200B;

I called my Mom and she told me that I shouldn't have given out that information, however, it wasn't like I gave the lady my whole social security number or any of my bank account information so it is unlikely that anything serious would happen. I ended up calling the number back a few times saying ""Hi, I called earlier and realized I accidentally gave you the wrong SSN"" whoever the operator was at the other side of the line would say ""Ok, what is your name?"" I would just hang up but eventually they just stopped answering my calls because I started to say that I felt like this wasn't the actual SSO. They answered once by accident and a lady said ""I know this number, hang up"" to the operator and they hung up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my Mom called back one time off of her personal cell phone and gave them my name, and when they asked for my SSN, she gave them a fake one. The operator told my Mom she was pulling up my file, and then continued on with the story about the crimes in Texas (EVEN THOUGH MY MOM HAD GIVEN MY NAME W/ A DIFFERENT SSN THAN THE ONE I HAD GIVEN BEFORE).

&amp;#x200B;

I called the SSO who told me that although I had given the last four digits, not to worry because they needed the full 9 digits to actually be able to do something. My bank assured me that if any fraudulent charges popped up I could dispute them. Lastly, I even went to the police station where the police told me to call one of the three credit bureaus and put a temporary fraud alert on my line of credit. I tried to do so by calling Equifax, however, the operator there told me that I would not be able to put a temporary fraud alert on my line of credit because I HAVE NO LINE OF CREDIT ESTABLISHED.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to take out a loan JUST to put a temporary fraud alert on my line of credit, however, I'm really worried about what the scammers can do with the information I gave them. The operator at Equifax assured me that it is not possible for them to open a line of credit with just my birthday, first and last name, and last four digits of SSN. I know I was so stupid, but the last four digits of SSN seem to be used for age verification on all sorts of websites, stuff for university etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit, is it worth it to try and take out a loan just to put a temporary fraud alert on my line of credit? Or should I be ok from the scammers? I'm not sure if they actually took down the information I gave them, considering when my Mom called they never even asked her for my birthday again. We never got to the point of the conversation where they asked me to give them my full SSN or take out money from any of my open checking/savings accounts. All of the officials I have spoken to (SSO, Equifax) seem to think that I am in the clear, however, online it looks like anyone with a birthday before 2011 does NOT have a randomized social security number and it is some sort of trial and error for scammers to find out the first five digits using your birthday and place of birth (bc that is what the first five digits are based off of).

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I can't freeze my credit unless I take out a loan or open up a credit card of some sort (which I do not need to do at this time). Is it worth it to take out a credit card I don't need simply to be able to freeze my credit?

t3_chj43r,Combining households and finances with elderly father.,"Pretty much what the title says.   Dad's in his late 80's, currently in the hospital.  Once he's stable enough he will be moved to rehab then I will be moving him in with me.  No stocks or bonds, he's got 2 savings accounts and a reverse mortgage on his house.  

Selling the house will net him at the most, $50,000.  There's some antiques and other items that will probably give him another $5-8,000.  His combined social security and pension give him about $2,000 a month.

He's talked about paying for some upgrades to my house to make it more comfortable for him/us or paying down my mortgage (~70,000 balance).  

At first glance that sounds great, but I don't want Medicare coming after me for his end of life care if he needs 24 hour skilled nursing care.

What's the best way to do this?  I'm already barely scraping by on a VA widow's pension ($1300 a month and my mortgage is $1,000 a month) and a seasonal part time job.

t3_chk69n,How to Better Negotiate My Offer Package?,"Hi there

&amp;#x200B;

Hoping to get some guidance on the best way for me to negotiate my offer package. I'm 21 years old and live in California and this is a pretty well-off startup company but a fairly small team. \~$72.5M valuation / 10-15 people on the team

&amp;#x200B;

The initial offer was $100K + $5K for transportation and $10K worth of equity.

&amp;#x200B;

I negotiated to $110K ($5k transportation included in the 110) and $12K worth of equity in person (they said on an equity basis that's the furthest the investors are willing to go) I could probably squeeze out another $5K on the base but I know they've already stretched pretty far as the top of their range when hiring was $100K.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as the $5K transportation benefit -- does that make sense to have it included in my base salary where it would get taxed? or keep it as separate $5K allowance as originally offered?

&amp;#x200B;

How should I / can I negotiate this offer to make it a bit better without coming across as I'm nickle and diming them ? Also, for a private company -- how can I make for certain that the # of shares they are giving me equates to exactly $12k?

t3_chlvzb,What is the cost of my free time when Iam not working? Looking for best calculation,"There is some kind of misinformation spreading over and over, that if service/product costs X and you otherwise have to do it yourself in your free time for Y hours and your wage is in $/h, then if costs&gt;time * wage its worth doing it by yourself and if costs&lt;time * wage, you go buy it.

I know it is simple, **but thats not how it works and its not accurate at very basic level**. This can work when you are in company as an employee, but in reality you have a lot fixed costs and the time basis is not the same.

First, in reality, if you work you have like 6 hours free (not counting commuting) in workday and 16 on weekends, thats 62 hours per week or +-9 hours per day.

Second, you have to get rid of your lifestyle and fixed costs in this equation. If you have to pay mortgage/rent, car to get to work, utilities, food.... then your net income is much lower. Somebody who is living on the edge is at 0$ net income (including lifestyle).

So lets compare these two situations in example of wage 4000$/mo (25$/h), fixed lifestyle expenses 3000$/mo and you are deciding if you are not sure if its worth to repair something that the repair will cost you 80$ or it will take 4 hours of your time (youtube tutorial or you have to buy some tools)

**1) Classic calculation: 80&lt;4x25 ( =100), so you will spend money to get it repaired**

**2) My calculation 80&gt;4x(4000-3000)/62 ( =64), so you will repair it by yourself.**

If you look closely, the most influencing variable in this equation is the fixed costs or your lifestyle. 

If you are living on the edge with 0 net income (you spend all your money on your lifestyle), you have to do everything manually, because no matter how long it will take, you have 0$ to pay yourself 0$/h. You really cant afford to pay to someone else. You will be losing money.

If you live out off thin air as a homeless with 0 lifestlye and 0 fixed costs and still have income, you can outsource all the works to the others.

t3_chjfs1,Salary Negotiation | How do I tell my boss that I know my teammates make more?,"Thank you in advance for any advice, and sorry for the subsequent wall of text.

I've organized relevant details I've been mulling over and a rough timeline below.

I want to ask my employer for a raise to $65k from $55k (possibly more if you can help me justify an approximate 20%+ raise in the right way after receiving 10% the prior year) and I'm trying to figure out how to pose all of this in a way that doesn't seem accusatory or that makes it seem like I think I only deserve a raise because it's ""what's fair.""

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

I work for a small company in the Los Angeles area as an account manager and I currently make $55k annually. I worked at this company for a couple of years while finishing my bachelor's and then left for a short period of time because a) I didn't enjoy the team I worked on and b) the pay was too low. However, during the time I worked for them they liked me, my work ethic, and I know they felt I brought a lot of valuable skills to the table.

I came back when they had a sudden opening on another team that needed to be filled immediately and I was able to negotiate a salary I was somewhat happy with at the time. I asked for $55k and was started at $50k.

&amp;#x200B;

From there:

1. A few months later, my colleague was hired at $55k with no prior industry experience (I only recently found out what she made; I didn't know she started at $55k at the time). I used my skill-set and experience to train her.
2. At my one year review, I put together a summary of all that I do, how I go above and beyond, and salary averages for account managers in our area but only asked for a 10% increase to $55k as I didn't want to come off as too greedy. They increased my salary to $54k, which I now know is *still* $1k less than the teammate I trained started at. Instead of evening the playing field knowing that I was asking for the same exact starting salary as my teammate, they still only gave me $54k.
3. I also now know that another of my teammates with no prior experience was started at $65k a few years prior. I know I low-balled myself with my $50k-$55k negotiations, so I mention this not to say it's unfair, but to note that I know that someone that works the same job is making that amount.
4. I just passed my two year mark with the company after returning, so I'm in a good position to request another annual review.
5. Our company sales have consistently grown year after year and owners of the company rave about it, thanking all of us profusely, but continue to cheap out on salaries.
6. I put my all into my work as a standard, but I've been putting in 9-10 hour days consistently for the past few months working on growing a new account that is positioned to be one of our biggest clients. The numbers aren't quite where they need to be for me to use this as a raise selling point because they're still very new, but I can pull the numbers we have so far.
7. I established a tech platform that's been talked about in our company before, but never quite accomplished, and put in the legwork to get us to a point that we can successfully repeat this with other clients. I’m effectively now our in-house expert on this tech platform.
8. I have other selling points, but none that are too different from what I pitched at my first annual review. Do I repeat those as selling points? They're still valuable skills that set me apart, but I don't want to be too repetitive.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have a lot of ammo to successfully negotiate to $65k+ annually, but I need to know how best to use this knowledge.

Note: I know what my teammates make because we're all very open with each other; I don't necessarily want to throw my teammate under the bus (for lack of a better phrase, because I'm of the opinion that not discussing salaries as the norm was pushed by employers and only protects them) and transparently say that she told me what she makes, nor do I think that's a very good negotiating strategy.

I don't want to look for a new job because despite how it sounds, this is a wonderful company to work for and I truly enjoy my job. It's just... nobody/nothing is perfect, and salaries are definitely a point of contention. The people I work for can be very reasonable and they're very respectful, so I think if I carefully consider how to pitch this salary increase request I have a good shot.

&amp;#x200B;

t3_chgoj6,(US) Condo building needs new parapet wall. Asking tenants to pay up front. Is this something that could be an insurance claim?,"Hi all. I apologize if I leave anything out that is important. Or if there is a better place to post this.

I'm currently living in a condo unit that has a home owners association. We have been experiencing issues with leaking in the top floor units and they have been looking for contractors to determine the problem. They have determined the entire parapet wall needs to be reconstructed. They are quoting us about 400,000 USD, which to me is insane but I'm not a contractor.

The issue is, our reserves are only about 90K, so they are talking about possibly issuing a special assessment to all 32 units that would be around 22,000$. Obviously this is a pretty big ask, especially as over 50% of our units are rentals.

I'm curious, and have no idea where to ask, but is this something that the building insurance would be able to cover? Or claim? Or is it possible they are passing the buck off to us?

2. I start my new job next month. I have money saved up, but my current paychecks do not reflect what I will be making. (And yes, I have the job. Pre-employment physical is next week)

I dont smoke, dont have pets, and my credit score has been ranging between 685 and 725 (currently 704). 

I want a second set of eyes for when I view these apartments. However, sometimes my parents arent available so my boyfriend might be viewing them with me (but he won't be living with me). 

Another issue I'm running into, is that many landlords want you to fill out an application prior to viewing. Theres an apartment that (online) looks near perfect and the price is affordable. I want to fill out an application, but it requires information like previous landlord and current landlord. I tried to contact them through 2 different phone numbers AND texted them and nobody will answer. They also ask about current employer contact information. Is this a bad sign?

t3_chkrq6,Is it wise to keep letting debts accumulate while I finish school?,"Hey everyone, so I'm a 29 year old single mom to a 3 year old, currently working two days a week, making around $400/mo to pay my car note. A family member agreed to pay the rest of my rent/bills while I attend an online coding bootcamp. The program is designed to be completed while working full-time, but because I have a 3 year old I found it difficult to actually find the time to do it, so I reduced my hours at work. This is my third attempt at schooling after 2 failed attempts at part-time CS grad school and working full time.

The main reason I chose a bootcamp is that my current job wasn't paying enough to cover my expenses even while working full-time, and Family Member was already helping me out. I was making around 20k/yr. Since then I've been approved for food benefits from the state and would have around $400/mo to put towards debt if I went back to work full time. Currently, my debts are accruing late fees, I'm getting letters about them going to collections, and my credit score is dropping. I also have nothing in savings and can't save anything unless I go back to work full-time.

I was hoping to buy a home in the next two years. My program will be done in November, but may take longer if I go back to work full time, and the program won't guarantee me a job if I take longer than 6 months to finish it (which just means they won't refund my money if I don't find a job in 6 months after graduation). Is it better to let debts go for now and focus on learning a new skill and getting a better paying job come November, or should I be trying to maintain my credit at all costs? Am I setting myself back further than I think if I let these debts sit until November? I started the program in May and my credit has already tanked just from these few months of living off credit cards and then not paying the bills. I have around $600 in credit card debt (both maxed now), 70k student loan debt (no payments due), 3k from my failed grad school attempt, 13k on the car and $100 in medical bills.",personalfinance

t3_chimq9,Commute from Nice Area or Live Close to Not So Nice Area (FL),"This might be a bit long so please bear with me.

I am a psychology student who accepted a paid internship in X County (one of very few slots with health insurance and benefits interns). X County is within a very rural area that are mostly houses and older people (average age is 55 years old). My stipend for the year is $15,600, but after graduation with my degree next May, my starting pay in my career can range from $55k-$65k. I decided to apartment search in County Y in a bigger city and managed to find a place that cost $994 a month. I knew that my internship stipend wouldn't be enough so I saved money from part time jobs and federal student loans refunds, in addition to using the refunds will on my internship (I have online classes while I intern). I know I can make it work with what I have for the next nine months financially, but one of my concerns is the commute. The commute from County Y to County X is 30 miles and vice versa. The path to get there is on a long state road (not a highway). My parents like my apartment choice, but they don't like the long commute from my apartment and insist that I live within the rural area to shave off my commute time. I know where they are coming from, but I like my future apartment in County Y and I like the living area surrounding it, and with even with the same budget I have in County X, I wouldn't live in a not so good area. And since I know this internship will end in 9 months, I wouldn't commute anymore. In addition, after my internship in County X, I was planning on getting a job in County Y. My career (not teaching) has a shortage and many counties in Florida are desparate for us to work with them. 

TL;DR So my question is is it worth commuting 30 miles one way to live in a nicer area or live closer to work and live in a not so nice area? For what it's worth, County Y is more diverse than County X. (I am a POC.)",personalfinance

I'm sure you would love to berate me, while that's OK, it won't solve any purpose. I just want your advise/validation on what I should do. All I can say is that finally I have bought my family on the same page as me, and we are committed to get out of this situation. I have my whole life ahead of me, I'm M32, unmarried, no kids. I live with my dad and my grandparents, we are in the same business together. I joined this business just recently. 

So here goes:

House Value: $500,000

We took a Business Loan Against our House of $350,000. We have to still repay around $400,000 (includes Interest).

Monthly Payment for Business Loan: **$3400** (for the next 9.5 years)

**Car Loans**

We own 3 cars:

First Car: **$150** only one payment remaining

Second Car:  **$400**, 18 payments remaining

Third Car: **$200**, 24 payments remaining

**Other Debts/Expenses**

Monthly Expenses (Office Rent, Salaries, Utilities, Groceries, Car Maintenance, Business Expenses, Insurance etc.):  **$4000**

Credit Card Debt: $2,500

Owed in Back Taxes: $10,000

Pending Business Payments to Suppliers: $50,000 (can pay this in instalments, as these suppliers still want my business)

Loan Against Gold and Jewellery: $11,500 (after payment of which we will get our jewellery and gold back)

Owed to Non-Banking Loan Sharks (high interest): $4,000 - I want to pay this off asap.

So, total Non-debt money owed: **$78,000**

**SUMMARY**

**Monthly Debt Repayments: $4,000** 

**Monthly Expenses (Living and Business, Excluding Debt): $4,000**

**Credit Card Debt: $2,500**

**Owed in Back Taxes/Suppliers/Non-debt: $78,000 (of which I have 15% equity due to jewellery)**

**Monthly Income: $10,000 approx (goes up or down 10-15% depending on economy)**

We are under extreme pressure each month to make ends meet, so we are considering selling the house, and paying off our Business Loan of $350,000. That way, we save on interest we're meant to pay. Because we have paid so much interest in the past 2 years, we haven't been able to save or spend. I have learnt a lesson that one can never enjoy profits if they are paying high interest. Don't fall into the interest trap!

Once the business loan is paid off, we won't have the pressure to pay $3,400 every month. And considering our business income is $10,000, we can exercise some level of financial freedom, and for a change, take our profits home. The mental peace due to that is invaluable too.

Also, I have a chance to increase my business income from $10,000 to approx $15,000 per month, by infusing $3,000 into my business. So I need to fund that too, but that is not possible since we are not left with anything to invest after paying off our monthly payments, and no banks are willing to finance my business anymore as we are already 2 months late on our Business loan repayment.

Our plan is to sell off the house which is going at around $500,000 in the market. Pay off the 400k business loan, and use $50k to clear other dues and infuse our business with money.  The other $50k we will use as a downpayment of a new, smaller house, and the rest we will mortgage, monthly payments of that should be around $1500 per month, which we can easily manage because we have cleared our big debts. We believe that rather than paying $700-800 rent a month, why not spend that money on a house you can own instead. Sure, the new house is gonna be a small apartment in a location away from the city centre, but that's OK, an asset is an asset.

Does that sound like a plan? Or should I try to keep the house, thereby struggling every month to make payments, hardly saving, causing stress and anxiety to self.

Specifically, there is no car allowance despite driving 40k miles in the past 8 months, and the 401k match is capped at $1000 for everybody in the company.

I have recently upped my retirement savings to 15%/ check  (additional company matches 10%) and my partner does 10% (additional company match 6%).

Other Bills (approx, within $20 give or take):

Internet &amp; Cell Phones (same provider, no cable): $250 (Comcast, might move to an area with actual options, possible change).

Gas (will go down as commutes decrease): $250

Electric/Water/Trash (septic, so no fee for that): $170 (very small house, will likely go up with a larger home).

Pets: $100 (monthly average for all food and vet care throughout the year, young &amp; healthy pets, likely to go up).

Food: $400 average. We can spend as a little as $80/mo and as much as $800/ mo. My partner loves to eat out and will do so as often as the budget allows. Trying to reign this in. Huge variable month to month.

I've read a lot about rolling over my previous retirement accounts into a Roth IRA but I don't know if that's actually the best move. And on top of that, I get the impression that the teacher retirement system in Louisiana is decent. I am extremely ignorant on these matters and I know that this is probably something that I'd really need to hire an advisor on but unfortunately the budget is tight right now and with a little one on the way, I figured I'd come in here and ask.",personalfinance
t3_chhldt,Adjust fed withholding afterwards?,"Hello all,

So I have about 4k more withheld than I need. I know I can update allowances to lower the withholding in future paychecks, but I was wondering if my company would be able to adjust the past withholding of paychecks? Ie, would they be able to lower my past withholding by 4k and cut a 4k check to me?

t3_chf2oj,Gave my dad money to invest when I was younger,"When I was 16, I got my first job and saved about $15,000.

My parents wanted to shelter my money from FAFSA, so I gave my dad that money in turn to invest.  He essentially just turned one of his portfolios, about 10 years old, into my mine, but he didn't do anything official.

I'm 19 now, and I'm about to finish college. My questions are:

How would he transfer me that account (would it count as a gift?)

What are the tax consequences (it is long-term for him, but if he transfers the account, is it short term for me)?

If it is long-term, I made $30,000 this year, so should I sell that portfolio when I get it so that I'll pay zero in long-term capital gains tax? I'm graduating in December, and I expect to make significantly more after graduating. 

If I should sell the account, what should I do with that money? I've already maxed out my Roth IRA for the last two years and have a small emergency fund.

Any help is greatly appreciated.",personalfinance
t3_chjpha,"Read this in the paper today, what does this mean? ""the earlier you start saving to secure your future, the cheaper it will be"""," So I'm 21, recently have become concerned about my complete and utter lack of financial literacy, so have been doing some reading. However, I read this in the paper today and am not sure If I understand what she is saying correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

""The earlier you start saving to secure your future, the cheaper it will be. Read that again, because it’s life-changing.

Say you want to amass a million dollars by age 65 so diligently invest each month and earn an average 8 per cent return…

* If you start at age 55, you will have to save nearly $5500 a month.
* If you start at 40, you will have to save far less at $1050, but
* If you start at age 20, you will only have to save $190.

What’s even more important to know about those numbers is that our poor, possibly quite literally, 55-year old has had to find $344,000 of his/her ultimate $1m. Meanwhile our enterprising 20-year old has personally parted with just $100,000.""

&amp;#x200B;

Is it saying that to accrue $1m by age 65, you need to invest less when you're younger because that money will have more time to accrue interest? Ie. is she saying, if you invest $190 with an 8% return for 45 years, this will = $1m? And ultimately, because of the extra time the money has had to accrue interest, the 20 year old only needed to put $100,000 in to get the same amount of money? 

Also, really bleedingly obvious to everyone (but literally I've never learnt anything about money so I am super naive) but what is she investing in? In shares or something? In an account?",personalfinance

t3_chbfam,Figuring out whether to buy or rent a house was complicated. Am I the only one?,"Hello PF!

I recently had to figure out whether I would rent or buy a home. 

I worked through a few popular tools including the Khan Academy spreadsheet (http://www.khanacademy.org/downloads/buyrent.xls) and the NYTimes Rent vs Buy calculator (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html). 

I thought they were useful but I still struggled to get to ""an answer"", especially an answer I felt confident about.

For one, it took me a while to figure out how to think about housing appreciation, portfolio return and inflation. Those variables are easily glossed over, but can swing the results significantly! Also in Canada (where I'm based), mortgage rates are variable which adds another layer of complexity.

I didn't fully ""trust"" my results, mainly because of tax. Whereas the capital gain on your principal residence is largely tax-free, stocks and bonds are subject to tax on interest and capital gains which drags down returns -- I had to figure out how to take that into account.

I also had to weigh in other considerations, such as how much I valued the lifestyle benefits of renting vs bunting. 

Did anyone else struggle in similar ways?

I'm thinking about taking everything I've learned and turning it into a more beginner-friendly guide that walks through each input one-by-one. 

For example, one step might ask you go to Zillow to find a few houses you'd consider buying. Another step might show you historical housing appreciation so you have a basis for thinking through what rate to plug into the model. 

What has been your own experience figuring out the rent vs buy decision? Any thoughts on a more beginner-friendly guide or calculator?",personalfinance

t3_cherga,"Extremely burnt out from working 2 jobs, wanting to quit but unsure of financial stability.","I live in Canada, over the past two years I have been working 2 jobs. One job is a recurring seasonal job over a period of six months making $20/hr with benefits (Mid April - Mid October) at 40 hours a week. The other is part-time with hours varying between 20 and 40 hours a week at $25/hr with no benefits. I also have to mention that neither of these jobs include paid vacation or holidays. 

My Part time job is all year round and I need to work both in order to keep this job to make payments over the winter time. I have been absolutely killing myself so far this summer at an average of 65 hours a week. I barely have time to see my fiancée or family, sleep is bare minimum and I believe I’m on the break of a nervous breakdown, I dread going in to work everyday.

I’m pretty inexperienced with finances as I have just moved out with my fiancée a year ago and feel that I still have a lot to learn spending and budgeting wise (I’ve lived on my own once during school for a year but I had financial support at the time).

I don’t know how much longer I can continue working two jobs, I had to leave work early last week on two different days due to mental health/exhaustion.

My fiancée makes decent money at $18/hr, which comes to about $1,100 bi-weekly. She also has benefits that she pays towards taken from her pay. I have talked to her about me leaving one of my jobs and she said she would support me no matter what, as I did for her when she was having issues work wise.

Here is a list of our expenses per month;

Rent - $800
Car Payment - $323
Car Insurance- $170
Groceries - $200
Internet - $90
Phone Payment - $95
Student Loans - $77
Gym Membership - $30
Apple Music - $17

I’m just wondering if I were to quit a job, which one would you recommend? Would we be able to afford this lifestyle comfortably if I were to leave one of my jobs?

I should mention that my part time job has offered me 30-40 hours a week guaranteed starting this October. If I work this for a few years there is a chance I get on full time which would include benefits, vacation and sick days.

Didn't realize how much of a trap that is, and it's always been like that.!&lt;
      * &gt;!Took out a personal loan ($3k) in order to move out after things started getting violent. I had to leave immediately, it was short-notice, had not been working because was trying to finish studies asap.

      * &gt;!Addiction-prone and emotionally abusive family members on both sides going up three generations!&lt;
      * &gt;!Escapism-centric; primary addiction is immersive micromanagement video games. Leads to other avenues of addiction, such as drugs and alcohol. Codependence. Self-confidence. It's a web of self-sustaining bad decisions, it's a cycle that's very hard to break but has a very predictable structure. Subconscious reasoning: I hate my life, myself, and want to be anyone, anything else. This existential pain is easily ignored with virtual environments, made more immersive through mind-altering substances, so that real life may be easily forgotten. Logical conclusion: change my life so that I like it, change self so that I like me. Harder in practice than in theory.!&lt;
      * &gt;!Has led to poor health, self-neglect, neglect of beloved pets, manipulative behavior, neglect of family, isolation, disgusting and dilapidated living conditions, and more self-sabotage. Mind automatically jumps to seeking more escapist behavior, like clockwork. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Education**

* &gt;!Started as engineering major in state-backed community college. !&lt;
   * &gt;!Was doing great; worked out to get into the best shape of my life, diligently studying led to straight A's for several semesters, had a great Pell Grant, didn't need to work thanks to generosity and hospitality of US-based Mom, life was good, minus the horrible lack of girlfriends - but that isn't important to me anymore.!&lt;
   * &gt;!Had already completed several credits in a different major at the same institution about a decade earlier, caused problems with SAP. Did not complete because I moved to EU and happily left my life here behind. I returned two years ago to finish my Assoc. and take advantage of these credits. !&lt;
* &gt;!Obstacles!&lt;
   * &gt;!Mother became single, developed into very toxic environment over time.!&lt;
   * &gt;!Mother suffered traumatic injury leaving her bedbound in a cast for almost a year!&lt;
      * &gt;!I took care of her. It was OK at first, and I was happy to. More toxicity. Started being treated as something akin to a servant and emotional surrogate of a husband-figure. Mother demanded constant attention. Threw fits if I did not immediately respond to even the smallest of commands. Daily screaming, but it's always been like that with her. Didn't even realize relationships with parents could be different until I left the country and saw for myself. There was lots of gaslighting. I'm not gonna get into it unless some of you want to know more. !&lt;
   * &gt;!Good decisions stopped happening as I tried to cope with the accumulating stress and walking-on-eggshells thing. Started slowly but surely embracing my vices. Start of a downward academic spiral. GPA of 3.7 is now a 1.98!&lt;
   * &gt;!Turned out I needed to continue taking courses at this community college for another two years in order to get my associates degree, but I had too many credits and no financial aid.!&lt;
      * &gt;!If I switched majors to General Studies, would only need to retake Chem 2. Currently doing that, so I have something to show for my effort instead of nothing at all, even though it's basically as useful as a high school diploma. Will hopefully graduate soon.!&lt;
   * &gt;!ACL reconstruction surgery!&lt;
      * &gt;!Knee was a ticking time bomb, was informed last January that I seriously needed surgery. Tried to tough it out to stay in the semester and just get it done over the summer. Messed my knee up, had to have the surgery anyway after semester midpoint, the deadline where you can still withdraw from classes. Had to initiate emergency withdrawal. My academic record must look extremely good by now.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Employment**

* &gt;!I can't seem to be able to hold any job longer than a few months. I never get an explanation why I get laid off or why I stop showing up on the schedule. Turns out begging for your job is totally pointless, too. I think it's my personality and my incredible ability to ruin any and all of my plans by somehow always being tardy through random coincidence or secretly indulging in addiction. The tardiness is a severe problem that I seem incapable of dealing with properly, and it is the primary cause for 50% of my life's stress and anxiety.!&lt;
* &gt;!I've had multiple jobs at once, many times. I don't ever want to do that again unless the pay is amazing.!&lt;
* &gt;!I've had ideas that have gotten others quite wealthy, especially if I was already working for them. I never saw a dime.!&lt;
* &gt;!Retail makes me sick to the stomach, as it really is just the art of lying and manipulating. I don't want to be good at it, I've had enough of that in my life.!&lt;
* &gt;!I can't stand having a boss.!&lt;
   * &gt;!After 15 years of worthless entry-level and sub-management positions across several countries and industries with long periods of undocumented unemployment between each job, resume is generally considered either overqualified or dismissed outright.!&lt;
   * &gt;!The idea of being doomed to making a business owner slightly wealthier with my work, with my only incentive being avoiding homelessness for another month, feels like a fate worse than death. I think my only salvation is to become my own boss somehow. Too many business ideas, not enough capital, not enough know-how, not enough action. !&lt;

# The Main Situation: Self-Exile in Default

* Dual citizen, USA and EU.
* No USA assets.
* No USA family.
* No USA friends.
* Insignificant income.

&amp;#x200B;

I took out the loans so I could get by, get out of my Mom's, afford security deposits, rent, groceries, gasoline, insurance. I needed to buy time on borrowed money to find a job and study. Got the jobs, ended up losing them with little to no explanation, per the norm, a month or two later. The money was terrible, but enough. Financial aid was long-gone, after which I turned to both sub- and unsubsidized Stafford loans (20k, and I'm not getting it anymore after my Academic Improvement Plan was tossed due to administrative withdrawal from absences. Yep, vices were being indulged).

So, I turned to private student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Sallie Mae's loaned me $12500. I spent some of the money wisely, the rest poorly, not only against my better judgement but also unintentionally. I'm bad with wealth management and budgeting, but I really want to learn. It's hard to understand all of the jargon and percentages involved.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I have gathered, if I just left the country and never came back, I could just forget all about my student debt here and live my other life. I would probably even get away with it.

The only negative repercussions I can see, based on my research, are:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Absurd**

* &gt;!""Student Debt 'Bounty Hunters'""!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Worrying**

* &gt;!Running away with Uncle Sam's money!&lt;
   * &gt;!Definitely do not want to do this. I will do an IBR and go for insolvency eventually, if I can't pay off my debt. It's borrowed money. I don't want it over my shoulders.!&lt;
* &gt;!The consequences of ever having to need to return to the USA after self-exile. Although I have lived a far happier life outside of the States, the USA has several distinct advantages for its citizens:!&lt;
   * &gt;!I think it's easier to start a business here!&lt;
   * &gt;!I think another world war is going to happen within six years, so I'd like to have the ability to hide behind USA's nuclear arsenal and have access to a firearm. !&lt;
   * &gt;!If I manage to get a bachelor's degree, I would like to attempt getting into Officer school for the Navy or Air Force, in order to give me experience, a way to eliminate some of my debt, learn structure and discipline, and effective fitness maintenance skills. !&lt;
      * &gt;!I've experienced far worse things than boot camp and I'm used to being shouted at  and interrupted constantly. However, this sort of shouting would be elementally different from the sort I'm used to, and I believe it'd be far less difficult to tolerate. It wouldn't seem as pointless, even if I didn't understand the order. I'd just have to do what I'm told to do - this seems like a relief. !&lt;
      * &gt;!This would also only be after I have fully left my addiction in the past. It's really just the games now, the root of it all. If I fix my life, I don't think I would be inclined to rely on my escapist vices outside of habit, which can be conquered through at least 25 days of repetitive proactive behavior.!&lt;
* &gt;!Having to live ""on the run""!&lt;
   * &gt;!No social media!&lt;
      * &gt;!Honestly, this seems more a positive than a negative. I'm tired of baby pictures, other people boasting about extravagant vacations, and professional accomplishments, and Instagram narcissists that get wealthy because of the way their ass is shaped and presented.!&lt;
* &gt;!Moving every time collection agencies find me!&lt;
   * &gt;!Not sure why I'd even have to do this in the first place, explanations are scarce or nonexistant!&lt;
* &gt;!Avoiding getting served in person would be more feasible, but can't the SOL just be renewed every ten years by debt acquisition companies?!&lt;
* &gt;!I don't want to live on the run, I'm not a criminal.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

and **The Irrelevant**

* &gt;!Ruined credit score.!&lt;
   * &gt;!Only applies in the USA.!&lt;
* &gt;!Accruing debt and compounded interest!&lt;
   * &gt;!Seems to only apply in the USA!&lt;
      * &gt;!I've seen mention of some sort of agreements the USA has with the EU, something called MARV or MARD, where I understand the USA could just extradite you back into its loving embrace or seamlessly transfer the debt to an EU collections agency. If anyone has information about this or something similar, it is welcome.!&lt;
* &gt;!Harrassment of family members and friends in the States!&lt;
   * &gt;!Not Applicable, mother recently retired to the motherland.!&lt;
   * &gt;!Dad's been dead since I was 12, but he wasn't really around anyway.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Rationale:**

&gt;Not only have I already experienced it, but I know I would have absolutely no qualms about never returning to the States. However, I am much more mature now and hopefully wiser than before, and I realize now that it was never the country that I despised, but rather the town where I grew up. I know I could find happiness in the USA, too. But the supersaturated media and obnoxiously manipulative mega-marketing does get quite old, and it's really hard to beat free healthcare and higher education. The whole concept of a debt-based economy sounds horribly plutocratic to me, as well. And Trump's been hiring businesspeople into positions of political power, which is very worrying, but honestly it's kind of always been like that, just not so direct. The EU seems to primarily have issues with militant nationalism and Islamic refugees, for the most part, but I am likely misinformed.

&amp;#x200B;

# I don't want to default on my debt.

The idea to run away from it is extremely tempting. I always thought I could just pay the debt off no problems with an engineering degree. It doesn't look like that's going to happen now, because apparently this chaotic and creative mind of mine will have to be happy stocking shelves for a living (that's one of the top careers for my degree). I know I can amount to so much more, but the lack of money I've imposed on myself is holding me back. My personal issues are holding me back. All the cards are stacked against me, which is infuriating. I want to rebel against destiny, and force my own future into existence. I could do that with papers proving my capabilities, and this isn't one of them.

But I borrowed that damn money, it wasn't mine to begin with, and it doesn't sit right with me. It's against my fundamental ideology.I've this very specific gut feeling that going through with this would end up severely biting me in the ass down the road. I've been through enough to recognize this particular gut feeling, and it's usually been proven to have been correct, even if I couldn't explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just really don't know what else I can do. I can go to work, but that won't last, and it won't be for a living wage. I can try to educate myself more to get a job I could truly excel in, but I've made it almost impossible  to do so without further loans, not to mention my convoluted transcript.

t3_chd2vh,Help with a fraud claim from a gas station,"I need some advice regarding a fraud claim we are trying to make with both CitiBank and a Love's gas station. We are being charged over $400.00 for diesel, when neither of us have vehicles that take diesel.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I are PCSing and started a PPM/DITY (whatever they call it now) move last Thursday and stopped at a Love's to top off our gas and weigh the vehicles full at the start of our trip. My husband used the government travel credit card to fill up my car (a Mazda3), and it only needed a few unleaded gallons (less than 4). He was not asked for a zip code or pin, nor was he offered a receipt. He didn't think anything of it since it was a small charge and his mind was on our long day of driving. I sat at the pump for at least 10 minutes after he hung this pump back up.

&amp;#x200B;

 He then moved to another pump to fill up his car (a Mazda CX-5) using the government travel card, and it was denied. He tried a few times, thinking that he may have entered the wrong zip code (which it did ask for this time) because again, we were moving. He ended up using our personal card to top himself off, and then went inside to grab something to drink, paying with the personal card again. I was still sitting in my car at the original pump this entire time, and no one took the pump off the hook to continue filling.

&amp;#x200B;

When he came back out, we both drove to the CAT scales to weigh the vehicles. He went in to pay with our personal card and get the weigh tickets, then we started our drive. Sometime between the gas station and our destination, he got a call from Citi about a potential fraudulent charge at the Love's. He agreed that it was fraudulent because we didn't spend more than $75.00 between the gas, snacks and scales (5 different charges on 2 cards). They told him they would file it if the charge posted.

&amp;#x200B;

Come Tuesday, we found out that the charge did post and we are on the hook for the full amount. We have contacted the Love's station, Love's corporate and Citi. Love's furnished us with a receipt showing that ""we"" paid for over 130 gallons of diesel. The Love's manager claims he doesn't have surveillance to prove that we didn't pull up in a with a ton of containers or fill up a bunch of other cars, but we do have proof that we were driving personally owned vehicles from the CAT scales. We even asked if he would be agreeable to us paying for a full tank of unleaded gas per the rate at that time, but he said no. Corporate said it is up to the manager to authorize the refund. Citi needs a copy of the receipt to file fraud, but we obviously don't have a copy of the original one as the pump didn't give my husband the option to print.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a lot of money? No, but I am jobless right now because of the PCS and moving is expensive regardless of the dislocation allowance and per diem. We could really use that money to help tide us over until I can find a job near the new duty station. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea of what we can do? We are still compiling a list of evidence to prove we couldn't have made that purchase, but it is kind of weak: We don't own vehicles that take diesel, a diesel pump wouldn't even fit in either of our cars, we have proof of the cars weighed at the scales, the amount that our cars weighed is reasonable for full cars with unleaded gas not diesel, my car would have broken down if we filled the entire thing with diesel, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband thinks it's possible that Citi issued two cards with the same number (but that doesn't make sense to me), but I wonder if they had a system glitch; if a trucker was filling up his semi at the same time, maybe he only got charged about $15.00 for 3 gallons of unleaded.",personalfinance

I got a copy of my credit report a few days ago and It showed I had an account in collections. I had a medical bill in collections over a year ago (about 198$) that I paid in full immediately so I went through my files and found the letter from them (where I also had written the date that I paid it over the phone) so I could contact them to findout why it said I still had an open account. Logged onto their website with the info from that letter and it shows where I paid the other but is showing an additional 505$ balance from a different date that I was unaware of. No letters, phone calls, nothing. It's been there tanking my credit with no contact about it whatsoever. 

I Called the collection ageny and told them this to which they replied they sent me one letter over the course if the past 16 months and tried to call me several times-I told them I never got a letter or voicemail and they said they don't leave voicemails and just get trying to get me to pay it in full completely and they would do me the service if removing it from my credit, and saying it was my fault for not answering their calls and overall being extremely rude and refusing to let me speak to someone above them (called twice, talked to 2 different people). 1st- what company doesn't leave voicemails for a callback!? Especially when I supposedly owe them money. Also, Who calls back every missed number that calls them but doesn't leave a message? Not me- I get constant spam calls! And 2nd, thy sent ONE letter over a 16 month period!? They kept just repeating that they would accept my payment today. Pissed off, I refused to pay and hung up. 

I've since Contacted my insurance to make sure I had a claim for that date of service and my Dr to ensure it was something from them that they turned in-(extensive medical issues, tons of visits/procedures so it's hard to keep track especially that long ago) to which they are telling me they do NOT have and claims for that date, show nothing they've sent to collections for me, nor is that even the collection company they even use! This has happened over the course of several days, with about a million different phone calls trying to get to the bottom of this. 

I have no idea where to go from here- how can it be a scam if it is showing up on my credit report? But how can it exist if my dr doesn't use them or have a claim on file? No idea who to call or what to do. Half venting and half begging for help- anyone with any ideas I'd appreciate so much!

t3_chbs9w,High interest checking account paying decent cash back credit card.,"I'm 20 years old and grew up in a financially mismanaged household so perhaps this is a dumb question but I'm looking for verification here:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say I qualify and open up a high interest checking account (cash management account) such as a SoFi Money account which offers a 2.25% APY and allows you to write checks. I get paid once at month on the first, so I have my job direct deposit a portion of my paycheck into the account each month.  


I then qualify and open up a decent credit card such as the Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card which offers a cashback of 3% in your chosen category and 1% on everything else. I use the credit card the entire month for most of my necessary purchases (gas, food, ect) and pay it off in full every month using the SoFi Money account.  


Am I correct in assuming that the SoFi account will accrue average daily interest (paid out at the end of the month) and I'll also be gaining the cash back points from using the credit card? Is this wise and is this what most people do?  


TLDR: Do most people have a high interest checking/savings account which they collect daily interest on and just charge stuff to a everyday cash back credit card to maximize interest potential?",personalfinance

Up until we filed the paperwork to close the account – every distributed penny from the account was for a legitimate medical purpose.  Between the time that we used the remaining money in the account and filed the paperwork for account closure, the account earned one cent of interest. We have not received notice that the account was officially closed, but instead received a check for $0.01. 

So, I know this is a trivial amount of money – really I’d just like to rip the thing up and move on. But my fear is that this account won’t be fully closed until this remaining balance is handled.  

1. If this is cashed in our checking account, is there a tax penalty associated with it because the distribution is not for a legitimate medical purpose? 

2. If this is cashed in my HSA (like a rollover, I guess), does that count against our contribution limit for the year? (Side note: I currently have it set up through my employer to max out the HSA contribution).

t3_chibva,Should my mother pay off debt with life insurance money or her 401k?,"My mother has debt we need to pay down as most of it is high interest rate credit cards. Shes 70, and she still works as a nurse, however very little more than the minimums are being paid. She overextended bad when she bought her condo.

I dont know if theres much room for a HELOC, and besides she probably wont get approved as her balances are maxed and her FICO is in low 600s. 

I found out she has a small life insurance policy that shes had for 10+ years. I decided to get into the terms. She has about 11k in cash. There would be no fee to take it out as shes over 6 years vested now. The policy lets her take a loan out, or a partial surrender. 

I couldn't find much info regarding details on these two options however. If she takes a loan, is it subject to 2019 taxes as income? Also, when she pays interest on this loan, is it to herself similar to a 401k loan? 

What about just claiming like 10k of the 11k in cash as a partial surrender. I read this wont close the policy like a full surrender would. Is there any downside to doing this? Is it subject to taxes? 

I just ask because between fed and state shes at 30% tax brackets, so trying to avoid as much damage possible. 

The other route is 401k, as she had about 150k in it, market may be facing a recession in a few years, so it may be better to just take money out of that. I know taxes come in though.  I don't think she can get a 401k loan at 70, so it would just be a lump sum.",personalfinance

t3_chi839,Sister owes a bunch of taxes on wrongful death settlement,"My half-sister's father died in a jail fire in 2002. She was 3 years old at the time. His family sued the state and the county and won a total of $400,000. This was split among his children and my sister received a total of $179,000. She had to wait until she was 18 to receive the money and went to the courthouse to pick it up on her birthday. It's been about 2 years since she received her settlement and recently she found out from the IRS that she owes quite a bit of money for unpaid taxes and late fees on the money since 2002. How ""recently"" she actually found out about it I am unsure of. The IRS is going after her at work, contacting her employer, garnishing her wages, and her credit score has dropped from 750 to &lt;500 in one day. When I asked her about how much she owes in taxes, where the money was while she was underage, and why the taxes weren't being paid on it she told me to ask our mom. My mom is notoriously irresponsible with money. She took my inheritance from my grandfather when I was a minor and bought a plot of land with it, never paid the taxes, and the county took possession of the land. So I never saw my inheritance from my grandfather. 


After she received her money she put nearly all of it into a Roth-IRA account and does not have access to it, which is why she cannot afford to pay the taxes on it. Also, if it's even worth mentioning, when my sister first got the money, my wife and I urged her to get a financial adviser and my mom convinced her not to. I believe she now has a financial adviser but from what she's told me, it's all very confusing and my mom still has a bit of emotional control over her regarding what to do with the money because my sister is still so young and still lives with her. 


My main question is: in the event a minor receives a settlement, who is responsible for that money before the minor turns 18 and do taxes need to be paid by the responsible party every year? Was my mom responsible for the taxes each year until my sister turned 18? Could this potentially be a legal issue as much as it is a personal finance issue?",personalfinance
t3_chb5fj,401k rollover money deposited into wrong type of IRA,"I left my job in 2018. A couple of months ago, I decided to go ahead with my rollover. I had around ~$10,000 in my 401k account -- $6,500 was pre-tax funds and $3,500 was Roth funds. I was prepared to reach out to the HR admin at my old position, but when I logged into Principal (where my 401k was), they gave the option to complete the rollover online. There were a few options of how to do it. One was to have the check sent to me written to my IRAs with Fidelity OR a wire transfer. They stated the wire transfer would be done in 2-3 business days, while the check would take 10-15 business days. I was going out of the country in a couple of weeks so to make it faster, I went with the wire transfer. 

When completing the wire transfer form, I had to do it two times -- for pre-tax funds and Roth funds. I realized when filling it out that the account information from Fidelity (where my IRAs are) for the wire transfer were the same. I thought that was weird, but assumed the information from Principal would have all the details. 

Well, it didnt. For some reason when Fidelity received the $10,000 sum, they deposited it all into my Roth IRA. I realize this is my fault -- I should have not done the wire transfer, should have realized there was going to be an issue and / or entered the information in incorrectly. I called Fidelity to correct and they said they need letters from Principal specifying the total amount of each account and how to correctly deposit it. I then need to upload that to my Fidelity account and then give them a call. They would not do it based on the information I provided. The information that I could pull from Principal did not specify Roth vs pre-tax funds. You would not believe how difficult this has been. I have called Principal 3x with no resolution. They kept saying they could do it and then sending me a letter through snail mail stating that my 401k balance was n/a. Turns out they are not allowed to release info to me due to the type of contract they have (?) with my old employer. I have been communicating with my old employer, but the information they are providing again is not what I need. This is still proving to be difficult and I do not have high hopes with what Principal will be able to provide.

t3_chhwmp,Read the sidebar. Still not sure what to do with prior 401k,"I have a few options that I'm looking into. Currently my 401k from my prior employer is with Fidelity who also happens to be my new employer's 401k provider. 85% of my prior 401k is in a 2050 fund with a $5.50 per $1000 fee. The remaining 15% is spread out between small/large company funds, small/large company indexes, international fund, and a REIT fund. Currently my average cost per $1000 is about $3.7. If I rebalance the 2050 fund into my other investments I can drop that to about $3.4 per $1000, but obviously I would need to be more hands on with my investments.  
  
So the question is this: do I rebalance everything into available indexes, rebalance everything into my prior employer's 2050 fund to set and forget, or do I rollover everything into my new company's 401k?  
  
Edit: I should also add - I do have a Roth IRA with Wealthfront (fee free for now) as well as an active trading account that I buy some of Fidelity's indexes and long term hold stocks that I like such as Disney.",personalfinance
t3_chhvct,"Recent college graduate; need some help/advice/feedback creating a budget, saving, and (possibly) investing.","Hello, I recently graduated college and got my first big-boy job and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed with everything. I'll list what I have going on now, and if anyone has any feedback or advice for me, I'd really appreciate it!

**Income and Current Savings**

After I graduated, I accepted a job at *generic American company* where I currently make ~$70,000 / year before tax. After tax, my income is broken down as follows (amounts are approximate):

* 15% to Roth 401(k), with a 6% company match: ~$1,000 / month
* 20% to savings account: ~$600 / month
* Rest to checking account: ~$2,400 / month

As for savings, I have approximately ~$20,000 saved up from my previous job(s) that's currently sitting in a savings account at my bank (I think earning less than 1% interest).

**Current Expenses**

I moved back in with my parents after college, so my monthly expenses right now are relatively low. I am currently still on my mother's health insurance (I'm younger than 26), so I'm not including health insurance costs here.

* Car insurance: ~$200
* Gas for car: ~$60-70
* Phone: $40
* Spotify Premium: $10
* Xbox LIVE: $5

Total: ~$350

Surplus: ~$2,000

**Current Debt**

I was very fortunate to graduate college with no student debt, so I'm good on that front. The only other debt is $500 in credit card debt; I have my credit card set up to automatically pay the full outstanding balance at the end of each month, so that's taken care of (my credit score is currently ~750). I really only use my credit card for gasoline and the odd internet purchase.

**What I Want to Do**

First, get my own apartment (I will be living alone). After doing some research, here's what I think a hypothetical monthly breakdown for a 1-bedroom apartment would look like in my area. Feedback in this area is much appreciated! I'd like to know what I'm getting in to...

* Rent: $900
* Food: $300
* Water: $50
* Electricity: $80
* Internet: $80
* Toiletries/personal hygiene: ~$50

Do I need renter's insurance? How much would that be a month?

I'll also need to buy my own furniture; I currently have my own bed &amp; nightstand, desk, TV stand, and dresser. Really, I only *need* a couch and a dining room table &amp; chairs - maybe a one-time purchase of ~$2,500?

Second, save for retirement and a rainy day fund. I think I'm on the right track here.

Third, get a new-ish car. I'm thinking something in the $10,000 to $20,000 range, max 3/4 years old. I'm planning to gift my current car to either my dad or sisters, so I won't get anything from selling it.

Fourth, invest. I already have a Vanguard brokerage account set up, but I've been too scared/overwhelmed to do anything with it yet.

Fifth (10 to 20 years down the line), buy a house.

**Conclusion**

Typing it all out actually cleared some things up for me, so that's good. I would still like some feedback/criticism on what I can do better, etc. Main goal right now is to save and/or invest enough so that if some emergency happens, I won't be left scrambling for cash.

Thanks for reading and have a great day!

t3_chhl8s,Can I get detailed credit card statements if accounts have been charged off?,"Long story short almost 2 years ago I went through a nasty divorce, job loss, and health crisis including hospitalization. 

I was unable to pay for quite a few credit cards and a personal loan before I recovered and all accounts have been charged off and sent to collections.  This includes Discover Card, Chase Card, Amex, Boa credit card, and a credit union unsecured loan.

Before the charge offs I was able to call each account and get the account balance at the time of separation and other info such as the current balance at the time and interest rates.  Problem is all of these were via phone and written down by me and given to lawyers with no paperwork to back it up.

Well my dilemma is in a few weeks I am due in family court (NC) for ""equitable distribution of assets and liabilities"" and have a court order to provide all paperwork to back everything up.  Honestly I have just stuck my head in the sand and tried not to think about it which is stupid I know I know!

I don't have that paperwork and am afraid the credit card companies will not provide anything since the accounts are in collections.

Do I have any leverage to get these records?

To boot I have disputes put out about EVERYTHING to try to clean up my credit and slowly things are falling off my credit as dispute fail to be acknowledged properly.  I am using creditrepair.com and paying the $130 a month plan (biggest plan) to try to get myself out from a 520 credit score.

As stated in the post I am a 17 year old. I got into a car accident and the insurance is likely going to be too expensive for my dad to afford if the fault isn’t put on the person who hit me. 

I didn’t go into much detail in that post about why exactly I can’t work, so I’ll do that here instead. My dad is on social security due to the passing of my mother a few years ago and his inability to work and raise my brothers and I at the same time, so he chose to take out social security for what he has worked in exchange for the ability to raise us.

Because of him being on social security, I will not be able to get a job until I graduate high school, which I now have one year left of. Me getting a job would result in money being taken away from his social security and therefore making the whole effort of me working completely pointless.

Long story: I made a ton of very bad financial decisions when I was 18-19, right around 4 years ago. I got a bunch of credit cards, saw them as free money, ended up maxing them out, and was too ashamed of my mistakes to bring them up. I ended up finding the love of my life, and fast forward to present, we have a kid and bills and jobs but I’ve still been carrying that weight of credit card debt ever since. For the most part, I’ve been good with the minimum payments, but over the past year my job had some fluctuating paychecks, making it pretty hard to get to bills and paying off debt at the same time. As my fiancée and I are planning to get married, we were going through a mass consolidation of our finances when I revealed I had this debt. It was a pretty big deal of course, both emotionally and financially, but now we’ve been working together as opposed to working separate on getting all this debt paid down. 

We expect my $1500 in CC debt to be paid in full by September, as well as working on a medical bill amounting to around $830. On both my credit accounts, I have payments late 30-60 days and it’s negatively affecting my score. Now that I feel confident enough to actually face this debt head on and we’ve already made good headway on it, I’m wondering if there’s any way to get these negative remarks taken off my record by the time I pay down all the debt?

t3_chgvbn,FHA Streamline Refi - downside?,"Any info on an FHA Streamline loan?  Our mortgage company came to us with something that seems to be too good to be true.  

We purchased a new build in 2017 with an FHA loan for $282K.  Our monthly payment (piti) is currently $1963 and our rate is 3.75%.  

Freedom Mortgage called (because I inquired about FHA streamline based on an insert that came with our statement) to talk about this.  

We’ve been approved to refi 3.25% (not a huge reduction I guess).  If we refi with the same terms (28 years to go), it’ll reduce our payment to $1874 and save is about $24K over the life of the loan.  

Our FHA upfront MIP payment from the first loan will be refunded to us on a prorated basis.  The new upfront payment will be rolled into the new mortgage.  The bank is paying all fees.  

We will end up skipping one mortgage payment.  And only need to bring $600  to close to cover escrow due to the missed mortgage payment.  


This all seems to good to be true so I’m skeptical.  In terms of monthly payments, I’m skipping a payment, only need to take escrow to close (so $1300 is staying in my pocket),  monthly PITI is reduced by nearly $100, and  I save $24K over the life of the loan.  Now I realize I’m wrapping the new FHA upfront MIP into the loan so my balance will end up being higher, but I think this saves me money long term.  Is there a downside to this? 

In case it matters, wife and I gross ~$170k per year, I’m the only one on the current mortgage.  Credit isn’t stellar (650ish for both of us). High DTI ratio even with our salary - thanks student loans and credit cards.  We live in Ohio.",personalfinance

I'm changing careers from teacher to school psychologist. They did not approve my PLUS loan and say I need a qualified cosigner to get it. 4 relatives and 2 friends have already tried to cosign and they were not approved. I desperate now.

I have gained a lot from this community and decided to be part of the conversation and bring up good financial talking points that could benefit other people.   


Here it goes:  
I am thinking of a opening a high yield savings account. I was researching different banks, and I came across two banks that offered higher APY's:  Wealthfront and Betterment (I know they are technically brokerages as opposed to banks).  
My though process in regards to selecting a high yield savings account was to simply see which out of the banks (and brokerages) offered the best rate, were FDIC insured, had a 1 dollar minimum investment, and had unlimited transfers.   
Is there anything I should know that would lead me to go to a bank over a brokerage? And more broadly, is there anything I should know about high yield saving accounts? Is my though process off target??  
Lastly, for example, American Express National Bank offers a 2.10% APY.  Why would anybody go to that bank if Wealthfront and Betterment offer higher yields?",personalfinance

I (30F) had a job at a convenience store to fill in gaps between grad school and moving back to my home city, where I once had and will have a livable freelance career. One of the primary perks of having that job was they provided 6% matching 401k through fidelity, and I really appreciated that the money was pulled directly from my paycheck and that the investment is relatively secure. As a freelance musician, I was behind in savings beyond an emergency fund, and I want to make sure I continue investing in this way. I have a basic acorns account, but with the fees and market fluctuations I would rather have the money pulled into an IRA (I will be rolling my current 401k into an IRA with fidelity, I’ve loved working with them) than put in an acorns account. However, the automation made a big difference for me. With the fluctuating income and dozens of income sources of a freelancer, it can be hard to set a fixed amount I will invest every month, especially as I have many student loans from my undergrad, before I had any financial knowledge. I also maintain an emergency fund and more aggressive investment with acorns, so doing things like “ok 10% of this paycheck goes to emergencies and purchases, 5% of this other paycheck will go to investment, 18% of this other paycheck goes towards retirement” becomes a lot of added effort and time.
Are there any third party apps that can take a percentage from each paychecks and pull it into my investment account, or parse it between my two bank accounts, and three savings/investment accounts?

t3_chg2r7,Additional principal payments vs other investment,"Hello PF! 

I just bought my first property this year. 382k financed at 4.375%. In about 5-6 months I should have enough equity in the property to remove the monthly PMI (~$120). 

## Current Scenario
My mortgage payment is $1900 not including HOA, taxes, insurance, maintenance etc. I don't have an escrow but I still put the money aside so my monthly ends up being around $2700. I've been setting aside $3000 a month into my ""housing"" fund to pay for everything house related.

## 6 months down the road
Like I mentioned, in about 6 months I should be able to remove the PMI. On top of that, my renovations will be done which will give me 2 rooms to rent out and more sq/ft to my property. I should be able to appraise higher than I did before due to the added space/rooms. Also if rates continue to drop I could possibly do a REFI and get an even lower monthly mortgage payment. I should be able to easily pull in at least $2k/mo renting out the 2 rooms

Given that information, what should I do with the money coming in? 

* A: Keep depositing 3k/mo and use the extra 2k/mo to build up a 4-6mo buffer in case of emergencies. Then use the extra 2k/mo to invest in other things
* B: Do option B but then use the extra 2k/mo to pay down the principal early instead of investing
* C: some other option I am not thinking of

I'm leaning towards option B because I already max out my 401k and invest in stocks (in a risky way), so I was thinking paying down the principal early will save me on a lot of interest upfront and let me build equity faster. The reason I like this is because I plan on keeping this property for a long time (will rent after I move out in 5-10 years) but in the mean time I would like to be able to grow my portfolio by using the equity in this property to buy a multi family in the future.

Last year, I inherited about $225,000, a distribution of a family trust fund  being dissolved that had been set-up by a deceased aunt .

I have little experience managing money and as this is all I have, increasing predictions and indications of a market downturn ahead has me nervous.  My portfolio actually did pretty well in the past year, a $20,000 gain (8.6%) as it closely mirrors the S&amp;P.

That I may only be liable for gains from when my share of the trust was transmitted to me or that the gains might be calculated from the date of the aunts death.  Not knowing how much my tax liability will be makes me reluctant to cash out.  I realize I need to consult with tax professionals but that is unavailable to me here in Thailand.

t3_ch9243,Vehicle conundrum,"This post is insanely long and I'll try to dim it down later. 

I have a job where I need a vehicle, I get paid 60 cents a km. I put on about 40,000ish km a year. 

Here's my issue it needs to be a truck, it can't get stuck and I need to be able to pull other trucks out of deep snow. 

I currently have a 2006 f350 diesel 450,000km, this trucks body is in mint condition and I have it setup for my job. 

The problem is this truck get 11mpg, oil changes at 6000km cost me 250$ if I do it myself. I've replaced two sets of batteries in 4 years ( 500$ no warranty on diesel engine batteries)  and two bosche alternators as well. Then on top of that fuel injectors , tires , other maintence and parts breaking. I'm putting almost 7000$ a year into this truck to keep it on the road. ( I keep all receipts so I can write is off)   The truck is worth probably worth 5k now. 

The truck makes me about 3k a year in profit after fuel expenses and the ridiculous maitnence and repairs, and this is also the vehicle I drive peronally,  if I go anywhere it's incredibly expensive. 

The truck constantly breaks down, and if it needs repairs I can't do my job, I work in remote areas and sometimes I have to bandaid this thing to get it to the nearest diesel shop. Those diesel shops know I'm in a bind and will usually fix it ASAP but will also charge me accordingly . 

I have about 10k in savings, 6k in trading account. I bought a house last year and put down 20% (50k) which is why I'm not in a greater position. I also gifted my wife 20k last year ( she lives overseas with our two kids) 

I make about 100kish a year more or less. My income is wild and most months I'll make about 4k net but then some months I'll make 20k. I usually work 8-10 months a year and have 0 income for 2-4months while I go overseas. 

So I got back from my latest overseas adventure, which is one reason I'm a bit cash poor. 

I got here started my truck and starter was broken. I just did two injectors, change transmission fluid and filters - 2500$ . Starter was 500$, this set my mind up to finally consider a newer truck. 


Cash poor.
Income 100kish average overall maybe 8k a month gross
Mortgage 1.5k a month ( includes taxes, insurance)
Hydro - average 250 a month 
Food - 200 a month - company I work for pays for my lunchs and three meals a day if I'm on the road I just use a company cc no budget. 
Clothing - 200$ a month.
Wife and kids - 1k a month. ( She does have money for the next 8 months ) 
I have no other debts 
My yearly vacation is between 10-20k but I am moving my family here so next year will be my last trip.

Income after tax 6000$
Expenses 3550$ 
 

Fuel,  insurance and everything else is mostly covered by my milage compensation. 

I looked at some Chevy 1500s yesterday priced at about 25k they were very nice and the towing capacity is decent 9100lbs the salesman said 23mpgs but I very highly doubt that. I feel like it won't be suitable for commercial purposes. 

Now debating on a 30k, 2014, 2500hd has 100,000km with a 6.0 gas. googling they get about 13mpgs over all. Gas vehicles are so much easier to repair and maintenence is way less. The new truck could potentially increase my profits to 10k a year if it doesn't need much for repairs. 

I have excellent credit and they require no money down so assuming I'll get 3-4% I did not allow them to credit check me yet. I might call my bank first to inquire as well.

Some of my peers have brand new 80- 100k trucks. I can't justify that, they have the advantage that they almost never break down and the trucks are much more comfortable which is nice when you spend a ridiculous amount of time inside of them. 

I'm fine with my older truck too. I really like it, I just hate the repairs I don't want to make a rash decision. 

Sorry post is stupid long. Need a devil's advocate. I will only finance on open loans where I can pay off principle whenever I choose. I'm on my slow season at work, I'm not in any position to pay off a truck.  

Current income is $4000 net and $2550 in expenses doesn't leave me much leeway. I also need to save for my vacation and moving family here. 

Optionally: I could work every weekend and earn significantly more, but I'm tired and having some health issues.

edit. Thanks for the tips. Here's my plan, my credit score is up about 100 pts since I got the auto loan, so refinancing might be an option. I thought 3% employer match meant 3% of the contribution, thanks to u/blahblahblah for pointing out it might be a 100% match of up to 3% of my salary which changes things. So I'm going to look into exactly which it is (if it's 100% match of 3% then that's another $1,650 yearly, definitely worth it)

t3_chfhig,23 Year old contemplating a job change,"Looking for some advice on choosing a new job. 

Some context:

I still live with my parents who do not charge me rent (looking to move out after I come to a decision about this job change), don’t have any debt whatsoever and only pay for insurance and phone. 

I got my current job right out of college in the advertising industry working in sales support. Not really something I imagined myself doing, but I’ve been there for a year and a half now. I make about $60,000/year after bonuses (Seattle). My take home is around $3,300/month after taxes, SS, etc. I have $30,000 in savings. 

Pros about my current job: 

- Very Flexible - I can take a half day with only a few days notice, never been denied taking time off as long as I make sure my work is taken care of, no one seems to care if I take off an hour early every once in a while 

- I can work 7-4 instead of 8-5 

- Can work from home 1 day a week

- My new manager is pretty hands-off, trusts me to complete my work, and sits down in Portland 

- Get my own cubicle so I can have some privacy 

- Salespeople that I work with love me and utilize me as a go to resource for their needs 

- Free cable and internet, good benefits, 401k match, 21 days PTO (would have to use if I’m sick and can’t even work from home), 7 Paid Holidays 

Cons about current job:

- Not a lot of room for advancement besides becoming an Account Executive (I’d like to do sales, but not with this company) 

- Very slow paced, which makes the day go by slower, but allows more flexibility 

- I don’t feel like I’m progressing in my career because I do the same thing for each client we work with and don’t see much of a future at this company

- Low competitive pay (~2% raise annually) 

Currently I have an offer for a position with a software company (that is growing very quickly) where I’d be on-boarding and training customers on how to use the software tool most effectively for their needs. It sounds pretty engaging and rewarding compared to my current job and I’d be interacting with customers directly. 

Pros about new job: 

- Higher pay ($70-$80k), 85% base with 15% being commission based 

- More interesting product 

- More engaging and fast paced environment

- More potential for career advancement 

- Employee Stock Purchase Program, good benefits, unlimited sick time, 15 days PTO, 10 paid holidays 

Cons about new job: 

- Set 8-5 schedule 

- No opportunities to work from home 

- much less flexible, the clients buy our time to train them

- much more supervised 

- Open office setting 

I can never really tell an employer this, but I really do not care about money that much. I just want to be able to do my hobbies (mountain biking, skiing, hiking, etc.), be able to provide for myself, and maintain a healthy work/life balance. 

TL;DR: Stay with more flexible job for $60,000/year and less opportunity for career growth OR accept offer at new job that is much less flexible, pays ~$75,000/year that has more opportunity to grow within company.",personalfinance
t3_ch9n1v,What is the best plan for my student loans as a medical student?,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to start medical school this fall 2019. I have significant student loans from undergraduate/graduate school (\~$85k, 5.9% interest average, please see table below), anticipate that I will be in medical school 4-5 years (my school offers a fully-funded research year), and if everything works out I will not accrue more student loans from my medical school program. 

For my undergrad, I went to an expensive school after my parents told me that they would help with my education and gave me incorrect FAFSA information (so I committed to the school which turned out to be much more expensive). I take full responsibility for my graduate loans because I wanted the Masters of Public health (MPH).

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently trying to figure out what is the best course of action for me, any advice is appreciated and thank you so much!

&amp;#x200B;

**MY SITUATION:**

\-I have a BS in human physiology and a MPH in biostatistics/epidemiology

\-I receive significant financial aid from my medical school. **HOWEVER**, I am required to take out a $15k loan each year, $7.5k in federal unsubsidized student loan (6.6% interest) and $7.5 school loan (0% interest while in school, 7.5% after) 

\-I do not need this $15k because my significant other (MD-PhD candidate) is covering my groceries/living expenses, so if need be I can repay this loan with the money they provide me

\-I may receive an extra $10k in grants/scholarship for living expenses if my math is correct

&amp;#x200B;

**MY PLAN:**

\-Live like the brokest student you can imagine. I don't uber, thrift clothing/cooking tools, don't eat out, make my own coffee, you name it.

\-Get a part-time research biostatistics job in med school to (most importantly) build my resume and generate income to pay living expenses/student loans

\-Make as many/much student loan payments as I can with what excess money I have

\-**IMPORTANT:** Use the yearly $15k loan provided by my school to pay off the high-interest loans I have from my graduate degree

\- I hope to minimize my living expenses so I can use that yearly $10k of grants towards my highest loans

\- I hope to use the majority of my salary during my research year ($25-35k estimated) to pay towards my loans

&amp;#x200B;

**MY CONCERNS:**

\-I am frustrated that my loans generate interest while I am still a full-time student and thus cannot make significant payments

\-I am worried that my interest will snowball into something ridiculous by the time I get out of medical school

\-I am worried that these loans will affect my ability to financially start a family, buy a house, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY QUESTIONS:**

1. What can I do (if anything) to prevent my loans from snowballing? I am not interested in joining the army, I don't think that PSLF would be right for me as it doesn't make sense to stretch $80k over 10 years (but someone feel free to prove me wrong!), and am unfamiliar/unsure about refinancing or consolidating.
2. Is there anything else that I should be thinking about?
3. Would it be financially unreasonable to start a family during the 4th year of medical school?

&amp;#x200B;

**ADDITIONAL INFO:**

\- I plan on setting up a meeting with my school's financial aid office to discuss my current financial state

\- My significant other's salary will not be able to help me much with my student loans as it will barely cover our living and they are hoping to save up for a car/house so we can avoid paying rent for 8+ years

t3_chfg6m,Social security religious exemption,"First time poster here!

I have some questions regarding the IRS 4029 form for exemption from social security based on religious beliefs. I have recently become interested in the Mennonite teachings, particularly, their attitude that the community should support each other rather than the government. 

Luckily, the 4029 form provides an avenue for Mennonites (and many other religious sects) to opt out of the SS system. However, after reading through the IRS form, it seems that one can only opt out of social security tax if their employer is also exempt from paying SS tax. I have no clue what sort of employers are exempt from paying SS, but I would imagine that they are few and far between. 

My primary question is as follows: if I convert to the Mennonite Church and file a 4029 form for SS security exemption, but work for a non-Mennonite employer, will I still pay into social security without receiving benefits?  

Since I object to governmental insurance and believe that people should rely on their religious community for support, paying into social security, despite my exemption would nullify my reasons for filling a 4029 and deprive me of SS benefits even though I was forced to pay the tax.

t3_chcefa,$1000 Ally ATM Limit,"OK, quick background. I've always been an early adopter, was using online banking for bill payment in the 90's when they were still Fleet (before Boa), and years ago I had an ING Orange account which I closed out when they went CapOne. I also have used Ally Bank for years. I still have my BOA account, but every year I deal with headaches from them that I do not like. They try to charge fees.

&amp;#x200B;

I am one who likes to have many different checking accounts. One for me, one for the spouse, one for each of my three teens. With BoA, this is all setup, they have their debit cards, I can move money around easily, and I can always walk in and talk to someone, or withdraw larger amounts of cash if I am paying someone back, or paying a contractor, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I like Ally because they just let me setup accounts, and no ATM fees (they reimburse). I like their GUI, and their model. My checking is earning 2+% in interest, instead of 0.000000000000001 like it does at BOA. I have a bunch of extra savings accounts, like ""car fund"", and ""emergency fund"" and small savings accounts I created for my kids, to hide away some of their gift money for later college spending cash, etc. .. **The ability to create as many free accounts at Ally to distribute my funds is one of the things I really like, for organizational purposes.**

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I got the old ""your balance at BOA is getting lower and we may start charging you fees"", which I think would be 12.95 per month on each checking account that doesnt have direct deposit setup (my wife and kids). Each year I go in and have to work with someone to negotiate a solution. I used to use BOA extensively for bill payment, but these days I pay all monthly recurring bills each month with a cash back credit card, and pay that at EOM. In other words, my ties to BOA are dwindling, and so their fee pestering is getting more annoying to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Ally moves money around pretty fast in transfers, but my main concern is that they have a $1000 ATM limit, and no branch or person you can go to for more. I've had scenarios where I need to get at more than 1K in cash same day. Are there any options for getting around that? I can surely ask them as well, but wondering if there were creative solutions here.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, another option is moving a piece of my IRA over to BoA Merrill Edge (I am mainly in Vanguard, rest in my firms 401k), figuring if I move over some amount to BoA, that will count as fee waiving material. But ... I don't know if I trust the fees and all with Merrill, even for super low cost index funds. But moving a little money over would allow me to keep everything status quou. If I switch fully to Ally, would have to setup the kids and wife with all new accounts and debit cards, and face the 1K limit.",personalfinance

t3_chezbz,ICM financial adviser and National Life Group; legit?,"A short while ago a friend recommended me a financial adviser who advises for free through a company called Independent Capital Management (ICM).

Some context about myself before I go into the rest: I am 24, making about 60k/year in California, and I have very little experience with saving/making money.

&amp;#x200B;

In my particular case, she advised that I create an account with National Life Group (NLG) as a safe way of saving money while making some off interest in the meantime. She explained that it was tax free, and that because it's an indexed fund, I essentially can't lose any of the money I put in, because if the value dropped, my money would stay the same instead of dropping with it, while rising at the same rate as it rises up to a point (10.50%). Even though NLG is a Life Insurance company, she said we would only be using it for like ten years as a safe place to put my money.

t3_ch929g,Using Federal Student Loan to Pay Off Car,"I have a fair idea that I'm doing the right thing, but I really wanna make sure. 

I'm in college, and I've received a Pell Grant that covers nearly all my tuition (I'd need to foot 400 bucks, which is chump change in the higher ed world anyway). 

BUT, I've also been offered a completely extraneous $6,250 unsubsidized Federal loan. 

After comparing the interest rates, the loan interest is about half my car interest (4.53% compared to 8.5%).

Now, I'm thinking of taking out the loan and dropping it all on my car. This would save me a lot of money in interest. Should I? Or is there something I'm missing? 

Note that the loan isn't enough to actually pay off my car, but would cover half of it. I owe about $12,800 on it. 

Thanks, folks.

EDIT: Once I graduate, I'll be able to make both payments. I live in a low low COL area and have a job that literally lets me work as much as I want.

The collection account was bringing her score down significantly, but it recently fell off of her Transunion without a dispute. From reading on here, I think a collection can fall off when the debt is being sold/bought by a different agency, but can we expect that to stay off? I had her get her free annual report from TU, which shows no delinquency, just in case. 

Also, how should she go about paying this debt? She’s about to start a full time job that will allow her to pay this debt off in full if necessary, but how can we ensure it comes off her report? I’ve warned her against just trying to pay it off and to instead negotiate for a pay-for-delete, but I’m not totally sure how to go about that, either.

By that I mean that we are the only ones at the store who write the hours we worked every day on a printed out spreadsheet.

The entire vibe of the store is really laid back, when I was hired I didn't even have an interview. I filled out an application then when they called me the next day they just told me to come in to work. The pay was never discussed at any point. The owner is a really laid back guy, he's very no-bullshit person but really nice at the same time.

I currently make minimum wage. I wanted to ask for a raise because I've been picking up a lot of responsibilities that I didn't previously have, such as driving the truck around doing deliveries. The way I see it, the other person who works on the register also (i'm assuming) makes minimum wage ($12/hr but boils down to $9/hr after taxes, basically), but I have a lot more responsibilities than her. I also pick up whatever hours they ask me to, and I've only called out twice... both times because I was legitimately ill. I'm not expecting to make like $20 an hour, I just would like a $1 or $2 raise because while I do really like my job, I also work really hard and I want to be compensated appropriately for that.

Does it sound like I deserve a raise? I think I do... I've never gotten in trouble or fucked up really bad. My only concern about asking is that I've only been working there for 6 months and not longer. 

Does anyone have any outside perspective about this? Or even some advice on how to ask for a raise? I'd appreciate it!!!! Thank you!",personalfinance

I am sick of having these loans looming over my head. I am 36 and I would like to own a house someday but these loans are going to make that impossible if I don't do something about them. I am working three jobs to pay off the credit card I racked up to 11k (down to 6k now) and the plan  was to continue to do so and put that down on my student loans. The prospect of not being able to start my life until I'm in my mid 40s is heartbreaking to me. It would take about 6 years to pay off what I owe on my loans with what I make, and what I bring in from my other two jobs (one is serving and one is bartending). That's with my rent being only $800 a month. I am looking at moving in with my partner soon but that will mean my rent/bills will be around $1100 a month (we need a house for various reasons and there is no other way around that). 

If anyone has paid off this kind of debt and has some advice I am all ears. I would like to try and pay this down even sooner than projected. 

I would also love to hear from anyone who has negotiated a lump sum payout for a lesser amount with the NSLSC. Is that something they offer?

t3_cheblo,What’s the easiest way to make quick big bucks? Morally.,"So I’m a married 28F who currently has accumulated about $4000.00 in debt. Now i realize this is not a large amount of money for a lot of people however I come from a poorer background and have always had to work for anything I ever wanted so for me it’s enough to be overwhelming. My SO is really good at finances and though I bring a bigger revenue in (whomping $30,000/yr) they make sure to pay ALL basic necessities for us rent/power/water/cleaning supplies. Our agreement is that they take care of all of those expenses as I pick up everything else. Basically our food expenses, typically gas, cigarettes (which i know i know... we’re in the process of quitting) and any other small purchases we make on a day to day. This agreement was made so that i could focus on paying off my debt. However life happens. We got engaged and married and financed all of the catering and honeymoon. This itself doubled my debt. This was still fine as I was still able to manage and pay all my bills and make some extra payments on the credit cards through bonus’s. Then I lost my job, within two months I was able to find another job making almost the same about $20,000-25,000/yr. The problem is now I am not being able to catch back up. During my unemployment I ended up having to use the credit I had originally paid and off and I’m basically back to the max’s on all my cards. My now new current job dose not give bonus’s like my last one so playing catch up I’m back to having to spend all my income on minimum payments while having to continue to use the cards on basic necessities. I struggle to get out of the cycle. Is there a easier way to bring in a couple extra grand to get me back settled or am I expecting unrealistic expectations?

t3_chbc72,Therapy clinic wants me to be liable. Am I?,"I'll try to be brief. My wife decided my 8 year old son needed children's therapy after the school said that he might be on the spectrum. I told her to see if it was covered under my insurance. After finding out it wasn't, she found a state sponsored insurance that would cover it. I said fine, and she took him to this therapy for a little over a year. At one point, the state sponsored insurance dropped the coverage and my wife was unaware. They had 4 or 5 visits that did not get covered. I didn't find out until recently when the clinic contacted me via email to tell me that I owe them $600 and they will send it to collections under my name if I don't pay. I never signed anything and nothing was ever paid under my insurance. They way they explained how the state-sponsored insurance works is that they have to bill my insurance for every visit and only once my insurance is rejected could they bill the state sponsored insurance. This system seems screwy to me. I would not have allowed the visits if I'd known they would try to bill me directly as we just can't afford it.

t3_che93x,(EU) My portfolio manager passed away and I could really use advice how to proceed with my portfolio management,"30 years old, from Europe.

I had a person consulting me in terms of my account management (telling me which orders to put in and when). His strategy was very risk averse, long term, which is what I liked. Before him I just used the Boglehead buy and hold strategy by having 10% in bond index and 90% in SPY index. But that would have not prevented a huge downturn of my portfolio during the recession. This person had strategy to get out early of bear markets to prevent loss of capital. 

Now I don't know how to proceed. I learned some very basic things from him, but not nearly enough to feel confident in managing my portfolio.

**There are only three solutions I see:**

- Hire a portfolio management firm (which will charge huge fees unlike this person with whom I had special consulting agreement and I wouldn't trust them anyway)

- Revert back to buy and hold Boglehead strategy. Just buy 90% SPY, 10% BND or maybe 80% SPY, 10% Speculative (gold,bitcoin) and 10% BND index. Rebalance quarterly. Set it and forget it.

- Try to learn his trade and advanced techniques. Technically possible, but I might not just have time and nerves for active management like he did. I trusted his decades of wisdom and profited with him, but I am sure I won't be able to replicate it. Even if I was to learn trading I have a portfolio right now that needs to be managed.

One thing that is stressing me out about the indexing / buy and hold strategy is when recession will come and my portfolio will take a 40-60% hit and will cause me great distress.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

**I currently hold about:**

- 80% US stocks
- 10% gold
- 10% bitcoin

Might just let the US stocks ride or replace gold with bond index.",personalfinance

t3_che6pz,First Salary Job 23k. Saving for dream purchase (UK),"Hello personal finance.
Intro I just accepted my first salary job. I graduated with a BA in Architecture. I have just accepted my first fully paid position after Hello, personal finance.
Intro I just accepted my first salary job. I graduated with a BA in Architecture. I have just accepted my first fully paid position after 1 year of hunting including 6 months of interning. Currently, I am working at a retail job on the weekends (started mid-June) with a weekly 16hr contract at £8.21p/h. The pay is one month held so I am still yet to get my first pay. I will quite after my first paycheck from my new job (25th August) and want to take advantage of my 75% employee discount to purchase 2 suits for work. My new job starting Monday pays £23k. With the UK tax system, the initial 12k is untaxed, so I believe the first 4-5 months at the least I will receive £1917 untaxed. After that my income to my account will be £1598.

Personal circumstances. I live at home with my parents. I have variable contribution requirements, this may vary from buying food for the family or covering a parent's phone bill, etc.

Goal.
1) Clear my overdraft. 
2) Purchase an (affordable) dream car within the next 9 months. 
3) Budget and begin saving for future aspirations.

I am -£1500 into my overdraft. Due to my account type, I benefit from not being penalized for this so I am not incurring charges but I wish to clear this and reduce my limit to either £250 or 0.
I own my car on finance. My beautiful (average) Honda Civic 2012 model year. It is a 1.3l petrol car but not as economical as expected. I have this vehicle on finance as a way to build credit. 4-year finance agreement, 7k value, 1k as deposit and 4 years at £175 a month, the total cost at about 9k. I finish payments in Sept 2020.

Monthly expense breakdown 
Current.  
[Car - £175] 
[insurance - £115 (I wish to change this to annual when renewal comes around)]
[Mobile Phone - £40] 
[Road Tax - £10] 
[Netflix - £10 (family shares)] 
[Social outings £80 (weekly meetings with friends)] 
[GF outings - £100 ( varies from £20 to £100 depending on the frequency and type of outings)].

expected cost. 

This is due to driving across London for work 
[Fuel - £160] 
[Food - £100 (@ £5 per day averaged)]

Without the contribution of family and other purchases that leaves me at £790 per month, which is approx 50% monthly net income. I aim to reduce my food cost by meal prepping at home. I have my phone contract for another year but may switch to a sim only as I am happy with my Samsung S9+. I choose to drive as the financial cost of taking a train will be more expensive than driving and takes 30 mins longer, alternatively, I could sell my car altogether and overall reduce my transportation associated cost. Total vehicle-related cost is £460 compared to £230.40 for monthly train pass across London (zone 1-5). That is a direct 50% reduction.

Personal Aspirations.

I am a big car fan, specifically Japanese sports cars, Honda being a brand I have always been a fan of, this is why I want to hold on to my car until I can afford my attainable dream car. I want to purchase a Honda S2000. I aim to purchase it around next spring for my birthday. I expect to spend £13,000 for the vehicle, my civic's conservative value will be about £4000 (Possibly able to sell for 5k) which I aim to use to cover 30% of the cost. I want to save about £7000. Pay majority cash (8k-10k) and finance the small amount to continue credit. Additionally, I would need about another £1000 to clear the last of the Civics finance.
I understand this isn't a wise financial choice nor a practical vehicle but this vehicle has been a personal goal of mine from a young age and I want to get hold of one before the values creep too high and out of my reach (like other Japanese sports cars have trended to) additionally it is still a honda with a 2 liter 4 cylinder, meaning it will not be terrible on fuel and it will be most reliable amongst similar cars. I want to hold on to this car long term. This is my passion and hobby along with side art and is kind of my treat for getting through some of the challenges and struggles of life until now.

I aim to get married in the coming years. My Gf and I have both agreed on a low-cost wedding and an extended honeymoon but this is further away.

I aim to start my masters while working part-time at my current company by Sept 2021. I can add the cost of my master's to my student loan.
My student debt is currently £56k and repayments aren't obligated to start till my salary crosses £25k. After 30 years (from 2014) my remaining debt gets wiped clean. There is no incentive in the UK to pay down my student debt. That extra money deducted isn't substantial, for example, if I earn £27k, only about £115 would be paid for the year. At £40k about £1200 would be paid for the year resulting in £100 a month, that's taken before I get it into my account so I'm not worried about high student debt as the majority of it will be written off.

Lastly, I aim to get a house in a few years with the first time buyers scheme. I aim to have saved £25k

My issue is that the monthly payments for my credit cards, alongside rent, car payment, and living expenses, are so high, that by the end of the month, I'm left having to use credit cards to buy food and gas. I make about 25k a year, after taxes are withdrawn. I have enough savings that I could make substantial payments to get those debts down to a more reasonable number, but then I wouldn't have any backup money in the event of an emergency.

My question is, should I put my savings towards my debts, or should I just continue basically ignoring it and paying the minimum each month until I graduate?

t3_chdxd3,Grad school loan vs cash,"Hi- my wife is a teacher and was recently accepted into a graduate program for educational administration. 2 year online program (6 semesters) with a total program cost of ~$21,000.  Completion of the program gets her a $6000 raise and opens her up to the possibility of higher paying administrative or school district positions down the road. 

My dilemma is- do we pay upfront for the program each semester or take out federal loans and pay back as we go? We have about $40k in savings (outside of retirement) with the majority in mutual funds and 40k kept 100% liquid for major emergency. In theory, the investment account isn’t supposed to be touched and will keep growing until retirement. 

My idea is that we take out a $3500 federal loan at 6% each semester and pay it off over the course of the semester. We currently save $1000-$1500 per month and would likely end up paying $50 in interest to pay the loan over 3 months. This way the money we currently have continues to grow while we halt our traditional saving to pay the loan.  All of our family thinks the idea of a loan is crazy and that my wife shouldn’t pursue grad school if we don’t pay it upfront. 

For my own peace of mind, it’s much easier to visualize a bill needing to be paid down vs proactively saving. Also, the idea 40k compounding over 40 years seems much more lucrative in the long run than cutting it in half and hoping we save it all back. Am I crazy to want to take out a loan?

I had researched them extensively for years prior, decided they would hold their value decently, and was moving 100's of miles away from my/ex's house where I couldn't use her family's spare car and my 96 Cherokee wouldn't cut it in a job where I was traveling ~500 miles a week.

So I pulled the trigger, ended up with a loan for 27k, at 2.9 percent for 60mos.

12 mos later, I'm changing jobs to one I'll be able to bike to (walk to, if I needed) daily. I can easily afford the 450/mo and it's not squeezing me, but it's also not necessary at this point. and that money would be better served going towards buying a house or retirement.

My subie has been worked hard in the last 12 mos, put on 37k miles, most of those through mud and snow for work. Has one noticeable paint gouge, and a small hairline crack in the bumper in the back where I backed into a signpost. Has mud plastering the floorboards, and some small coffee stains on the passenger seat. During upcoming inspection will definitely need new tires and brakes, and otherwise has had routine maintenance every 6k miles.

I know I won't get top price for it, and I know I'm underwater at this point, but as I near 50k miles, I'm thinking it's the best time to trade to something I can just pay cash for? Or since I can afford it, am I better off just driving her until she gives?",personalfinance
t3_chdjv0,Backdoor Roth IRA - form 8606 help,"Hi,

Is it the form 8606 that essentially prevents you from being taxed twice when doing a backdoor Roth?

We used a tax preparer - who I now believe to be incompetent, help us with our taxes.  We did a backdoor roth in 2018, but I don't recall a form 8606 or anything like that - and our taxes owed were significantly higher this year.

Is the 8606 the form that should be filled out to prevent us from being double-taxed on backdoor contributions?",personalfinance
t3_chdj6y,TDA - IRA Rollover Strategy Confusion,"I'm a relatively experienced investor in the stock market, but never actually had an IRA or a TDA with employer contribution. But now I'm in a job where, if I contribute 3% of my salary to a TDA, the employer will contribute 3% as well. I have a few questions:

1. The employer will always contribute pre-tax, but I have a choice between pre-tax and post-tax contributions. Which should I choose, if my eventual plan is to roll it over to a backdoor Roth IRA? If I go post-tax, the TDA account will have two source buckets, and I will have to pay tax on the employer contribution at the time of conversion. 
2. The TDA account is set up with Fidelity, and it requires me to choose one of their funds for the first 2% of the contribution, and have the remaining 98% shunted to a quasi-brokerage account that they call BrokerageLink, that will allow me to buy more mutual funds. If I decide to roll the money over to a Roth IRA every year, would I be better off just putting all 100% of my money in VANGUARD INST INDEX rather than mess with the BrokerageLink?
3. If I go with the last option, since it does not look like I can just keep the funds as cash until the rollover, what happens to capital gains on the VANGUARD INST INDEX when I roll it over? Do I pay tax on that? 

I'm so confused by all this. Thanks in advance for your help.",personalfinance

I'm in a position that I've never really been in before and could really use some help!

I'm working at a company in a sort of management role as an intern. I deal with clients and some other small projects on a daily basis. While I was working, I wrote a code to help improve our efficiency. My boss told me this could end up saving thousands of dollars. My internship (3.5 months long) is about to end, but she has asked me to work part time during the school year and develop this program more as well as extend it to several other teams within the company.

For the 2017 tax year my ex boyfriend filed his taxes claiming me as his spouse. This effectively made me responsible for his tax debt as far as the IRS is concerned. I was supposed to be filed as his dependent. However, he filed me as his spouse illegally without my permission. I've never been married.

I figured out when I went to file taxes on the 2018 year and ran into issues filing. I was able to file my 2018 taxes, but in my ignorance I used the AGI from the 2017 year as instructed by my ex boyfriend's tax preparer.

My approach to resolve this was to send a 1040x form for 2017 and a 14039 form (Identity Theft Affidavit) along with documents explaining my situation. I'm still waiting for contact from the IRS to see if they are working on this. Did I go about trying to resolve this in the correct way? Is there anything else I should do?

t3_chde1l,Credit repair + YNAB advice,"So my husband and I are recovering from a bankruptcy we filed last November, the discharge went through this April. Our bankruptcy lawyer advised that we get credit cards to repair our credit score. Should we find ourself in a better income situation in two years, we want to be ready to apply for a zero down USDA rural home loan, so doing our best to repair our credit is essential.  


We intend to charge any monthly life charges (I.e. gas, groceries, health insurance, etc) we would typically be spending anyways to the card and pay the entire balance off each month. (or maybe leave like $10 on the card, is it better to have some balance on a card rolling over between months, or is it better for the card to be empty?) 


Now my main question is, I am using YNAB to budget everything out, how would I budget those categories I charge to the card, when it just appears as one lump sum payment each month from my checking account? Is there a way to section out the payment into different categories &amp;amp;amp; different amounts? 


Something else we may do to repair our credit is to finance a travel trailer or RV to live in for the next two years. This is because in April we learned that I am pregnant! I am now 6 months pregnant, and the baby is due in November. We are currently living in my grandmothers house, which is very small. We have a full size bed and there’s not even enough room for a crib/players/travel bassinet in the room, there are no other free rooms in the house to put baby in, and I really don’t want to put my 80 year old grandmother through the sleepless nights of newborn baby. So we figured a travel trailer would be a suitable solution so we can care for and sleep with baby in the trailer parked in my grandmas yard, while still having access to the full facilities of the house. We could buy the trailer outright in cash, or put down a large down payment and finance the rest. We are set to have $10000 saved by November to purchase the trailer, in time for when baby comes and also likely the best time of year (after summer) to buy an RV. To give you an idea of our finances, my husband brings home $573 a week assuming he doesn’t do overtime, and I get $450 a week from unemployment which ends in November. 

Income monthly

$1800 

$2292

Expenses 

No rent or utilities

$190 cell phone payment

$64 internet

$160 car insurance

$189 health insurance 

$200 bankruptcy lawyer payment (will be done in 3 months)

$298 my school financial loan

$368 car payment

$400 a month to go to baby savings

 ( should have $2000 by November to buy any essentials we did not get from registry + baby essentials we need week to week for the first few months) 

$1800 a month to savings for trailer. We already have 3K saved) 

And there’s about $400 leftover each month for gas + groceries. Plus the income that will free up after the lawyer payment is done. 

From my research, we can definitely find a trailer to buy outright for 10k or less, but if we did put down a large down payment, our monthly payment would be around $20-50month, which we can afford.

I've searched the archived posts regarding this, but I hoped to pose my own conundrum to you all.  


I'm buying a car. $7000, everyone checks out. I was going to get a loan, but was denied with both a cosigner and secondary cosigner, both of whom had 800+ credit, neither of whom have had an auto loan recently (and were declined due to the lack thereof)  


My grandmother (the secondary) has offered me the $7000, interest free. Great, right? Except, the bank was going to be the intermediary between myself and the young couple from whom I'm purchasing the car.  


They have, on hand, the following:  


VIN

Copy of title, which has a lien.

Lienholder account number

&amp;#x200B;

Should I go with them to their lienholder, provide a check to the lienholder for the remaining loan amount, and then cut a secondary check for the remaining funds for the couple? Get a bill of sale? The title would be released to the couple, who would then sign it to me, correct? I trust the couple, but want to do this so that all parties involved are protected.

t3_chd96l,College Student in a Unique Financial Position,"Hey guys! Long time lurker here. I have been reading the wikis and that clears some things up, but I still have many questions. Here is my situation:

I am 18 years old. Due to attending college at 17, I already have a year down and 2.5 to go (advanced high school courses saved me another .5 years. My only major bill is rent, ~600/mo, and my other major expenses include food and fuel. My parents still help me out with insurance and phone bill which helps a ton. I drive an F-250 that I paid cash for that I would consider very reliable. I have a relatively good emergency fund and a lot of money saved up 

Here comes the unique position...for the past ~2 years, I have had a side business buying/selling ATVs. On top of this, I deliver pizza at night. I’m only working 3 days on that right now, soon going down to 2/week. Working 8 days/month at that job pretty much covers rent. Right now, I am making about 800-1600 per week flipping ATVs, which, for someone my age, is a lot, especially considering I don’t have many bills at all and live well below my means. 

Here is the problem. I want to start building credit and verifying income. I currently bank with USAA and have checking and savings account with them. Through USAA, I am tied to my father and his parents, both of whom have great credit (think 720+). USAA has tons of perks and I love banking with them, but they have no local branches or anything at all. I have to get a money order to make a deposit or use an ATM to make any sort of withdrawal. This is a major issue, because 90% of my income/expenditures for my side business are cash, and right now I have less than $300 in the bank at any one time which is not good for credit/verifying income. 

I also want to get a credit card and use it per PF’s recommendations. I am open to opening an account and get a credit card at a local bank, which would help a lot with verifying incomes and cash transactions, or do I stick with USAA, who I have a history with? If I should get a local bank/CU, how do I choose one? 

I figure by the time I graduate (business administration major), I will have a more than adequate down payment saved up for a nice house. I also am into cars and aspire to own an exotic and would likely be able to finance one (not saying I would but the option to would be nice). I don’t want to have to wait several years after I graduate to build credit and verify income before I can finance these things. I will have down payment and income to be able to, though, which is why I want to start doing what I can do now to help out with that. Thanks.

t3_cgl833,My mom refused to do dental treatment after seeing how dirty the office was. Have not received the money back. What can we do?,"My mom started her dental treatment in April including pulling 9 teeth out and 2 partial dentures. Her insurance paid $2,000, and she had to pay the remaining ($2,000) in cash right at front. However, in 1.5 months, all that dental office had done for my mom was just 1 tooth extraction and 2 impressions for upper and lower dentures at the first appointment. After that, they kept telling my mom her case was not ready yet. After waiting for 1.5 months, we came back to the office to get another impression (they told me that the first ones were not taken correctly, so they wanted to retake). When we walked into the treatment room, there was a dead cockroach on the floor, dust everywhere, and blue liquid spilled on the chair. I was disgusted and did not want my mom to continue the treatment. We tried to ask for money back, but it has been more than 6 weeks and they keep telling me the finance person is either on vacation or moving to another department.
My mom is having a hard time eating now, so what can we do? I know the State Board of Dental will not get involved in money dispute, so I'm pretty confused of what to do except calling them numerous times. Also, is it possible to get a full refund back as this was not our fault to refuse the treatment?

**Update**: sorry for any confusion in the last post, I will try to get it cleared as much as possible

1) I called the insurance today, and the office only claimed for the extraction and the exam. I should have said $2k was the amount that insurance would pay for the treatment.

2) Since her total treatment costed $4k, and the insurance would pay a maximum of $2k, my mom paid $2k upfront using her credit card as demanded by the dental office's manager. She claimed that everything would be done in 1 month, and they would send the impressions to the lab right away.

3) The dead cockroach, the used napkin, the liquid spilled, the rust, the dust were all in patient's room (I also took some pictures), so I think it's reasonable to think this office was dirty. It was dirty in front of the customers, so wouldn't it even be dirtier in the back?",personalfinance

In speaking with my employer’s tuition reimbursement department, they continually are mentioning tax implications:

“Regarding the tax implication, when you submit an online application form you do answer 3 taxability questions. Your responses indicate if the course is considered taxable or non-taxable under the policy. This taxability status is confirmed to you when you submit the online application form. 

 

If a course is indicated as ‘taxable’ then we will deduct taxes from the reimbursement payment issued. You are notified by the system when you submit the application for any course indicated as ‘taxable’ as well. When you submit the application, if a course is ‘taxable’, you are given the opportunity to go back and review/edit those replies.”

I want to move up north, maybe go to Montana, become state patrol, and build a house off grid and live like a hermit when I'm not at work.

THE PLAN:
I have two options in my mind. My parents are probably going to kick me out when they get back from vacation this weekend, since I quit my job so I need to do something.

1. Move out of the house and rent with somebody for a few months which would cost from $600 - $750 a month and I would not be able to save much. This would allow me to prepare for becoming a police officer but like I said my money would be stagnant.

2. Say fuck it and move up north now. I live in the south so it would easily take me a week to get to where I'm going. Then I have to quickly find a job and a place to live which I would estimate the worst case scenario putting me at $9,000 in the bank from gas money and not having a job for a month.


The second option is what would get me closer to my goal but losing money scares me. I try to be very very careful with spending and just being secure in general.

I would really like to know what you guys think and if you think I am an idiot or if I should save more money first or any other tips.

This card was previously a Capital One card and at some point transferred to CBNA.

Recently, these old accounts have started reporting as ""closed"" to Transunion every other day or so. In the past month they've been reported closed like 12 or 14 times, according to LendingTree. It doesn't seem to be affecting my credit score or anything, it's just annoying to keep receiving alerts in my e-mail: ""Did you close this account?""

It's not inaccurate, it just doesn't seem like something that needs to be repeatedly reported, years after the fact. FWIW card was in perfect standing with $0 owed.

t3_ch9w7e,"Mortgage company changed the tax payment frequency in my escrow, and now I have a significant escrow shortage in order to ""save"" me $100 for the year","&amp;#x200B;

My mortgage company recently mailed me a letter stating that they have changed the tax payment frequency of my escrow from quarterly to annually in order to take advantage of a 2% discount that my municipality offers if real estate taxes are paid in full.  This has caused a significant shortage in my escrow, and after researching all last night, I’m afraid that I’m going to be stuck with the only options that they have given me.  I’m waiting for the Loan Customer Service to open in order to call, but I was hoping to get some feedback here because I’m at a loss right now.  I never requested a change, have never been late on a mortgage payment, and I’m beside myself right now because I believe my options are limited.  I will try to provide as much info as I can, and round numbers.  

I bought a house about 4 years ago for 300k (270k loan and 30k down payment), and right now I’m at about 0.83 for a LTV.  My mortgage payment has always been around the same amount with slight fluctuations after an escrow account recalculation, but nothing drastic.  Only this time, because of the one lump payment, there’s a shortage of about $3,500.  They have given me 4 options:

1.	An extended shortage spread of 24, 36, 48, or 60 months.  They state there’s no fee assessed with this option, but they don’t state whether there would be interest or if I’m going to be in perpetual escrow shortage again next year

2.	Repay the escrow shortage in full (which I could have probably done if I hadn’t just bought a new car recently, which is why I’m in a panic and coming out from lurking on reddit for 15 years)

3.	If applicable, you may qualify to remove you escrow account.  (The emphasis on the word may is in their letter, and not mine.  From last night’s research, it doesn’t look like many banks do this… especially when the escrow balance is negative.)

4.	Have my mortgage payment go up $300+ a month over the coming year

My Escrow Account Disclosure Statement usually comes in November, but because of the shortage on the escrow due to the lump sum payment, they reevaluated it earlier and I’m receiving it in July. There doesn’t seem to be much info on this, and from what I found \[[1024.17(k)(3)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1024/17/#k-3)\], the Consumer Bureau only “encourages”, but does not require, the servicer to follow the preference of the borrower, if such preference is known to the servicer.  So, in order to “save” me about $100, my mortgage company is throwing my finances in total disarray at the last minute.  If anyone has any info, or could point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated.",personalfinance

I can also say that I hate the idea of room mates as in college I had one steal things from everyone and had drugs/parties so since then i've wanted to avoid room mates for the rest of my life.  

Rent in ~1 hour of my school for a 1 bedroom in the undesirable complexes is $800, and the income restricted ones that are not far from my school which are $550 have a 1 person limit of $34,000.  I wouldn't want to live that close to my school but i'd do it because they are not very bad apartments.  

So now i'm in a situation where I cut my savings/retirement to very severe minimums and spend ~50% of my paycheck on living expenses or quit teaching and go get a job that will actually pay me a living wage.  

I'm also considering depleting my savings and just taking the PMI hit on a super tiny starter house in my area which would be $650 per month but locks me down into this area so moving would be harder.

The buyout price is $29,000 but the value of the car for trade-in is only $18,000 so buying the car is out of the question. Other than a windshield that needs replaced due to 2 chips ($600), there are no other excessive wear and tear charges nor will new tires need to be put on. There is a lease disposition fee of $350.

I'm looking at a 2019 Tesla Model 3 AWD which will cost about $56,000. I will be purchasing this car. I have $60,000 saved (don't worry, this figure doesn't include my emergency fund). I'm leaning towards financing this car as I have a credit score of 810 and am able to secure a rate at least as low as 3%. If I do nothing else with the money saved other than tucking it away in a HYSA or a CD, my effective rate will be 0.5% though I'll probably find a better use for the money if I don't just buy the car outright. I'm looking at around $850 / month for 72 months to finance this vehicle though with the federal and state tax incentives it will come out to around $800. The specific build on this vehicle will be increasing by $1000 in August.

As far as the three options I mentioned above, they're all pretty similar for my situation.  Fees are roughly the same, and I have enough to invest that I meet their account minimums.  The differences that I see are:

- Betterment appears to offer better automatic fund shuffling between cash accounts and investment accounts

- Wealthfront offers direct indexing, which they say increases returns, but I don't know how to quantify that benefit

- Vanguard has many more fund options, but it also rebalances less frequently, does not harvest tax losses automatically, or offer a cash account

t3_cgqrmb,Doctor's office submitted the wrong reason for my visit and refuses to correct it,"About a month ago I called my doctor's office to schedule a yearly checkup. I specifically told them over the phone that the reason for the visit was a physical. My insurance awards $200 to my MRA for completing a physical, which I was planning on putting towards another medical bill.


The physical went pretty normally. They checked all the usual stuff and did some routine blood work. While there, my doctor asked if I had any change in my medical history, so I told him about a concussion I had in the last year. I had already seen a neurologist and also had a follow-up with the neurologist, but he insisted on checking my motor function and pupil dilation.


When I got my explanation of benefits for that appointment, I thought it was odd that I was charged at all (my plan covers 100% of preventative action), but I also noticed I wasn't awarded the $200. After calling both my insurance and the doctor's office, it turns out that my doctor's office submitted the claim not as a physical but as ""a concussion follow-up"". The doctor's office conveniently does not have any recorded reason for why I made the appointment in the first place, but they insist that the doctor's notes say the reason for the appointment was a concussion. So far they refuse to correct it. My insurance hasn't offered any help other than telling me to schedule another physical. Do I have any other options for getting this corrected?",personalfinance

t3_chceh2,Very tricky financial situation: buying a house and “unusable” money,"My friends, John and Sarah (unmarried, 3 kids), bought a house. In May, they needed to pay their down payment of $4,500. They were told they needed to write a check in 5 days. However, they were NOT told it needed to be a certified check, and simply didn’t know. 

John had the money in his checking account, but did not have checks. Five days was not enough time to order checks so he withdrew the $4,500 and gave it to Sarah who deposited it into her checking account. Sarah wrote the check and it was cashed the next day. 

The mortgage company notified them two months later that they couldn’t use those funds. In the meantime, John and Sarah provided paperwork indicating where the $4,500 came from. John’s bank statements showed that he got the $4,500 from the IRS as part of his tax refund. 

Now they are being told that the money is unusable because they cannot show how they got the money(?) The reasoning for this is because it had become cash for Sarah to put in her account. So John cannot even put that money back in his account to use. They have been told it is completely unusable. 

According to the lender, the only solution is for a family to gift them $4,500 with the ability to show that the money has been in their account for 30 days. Only a family member, no one else. So John cannot give the money to a family member to give it back to him. No one in either family has the money to gift them. A friend is willing to gift the money to a family member to give to John, but because it has to have been in the family members account for 30 days that won’t work either. 

John and Sarah, who is also pregnant by the way, have notified their apartment that they are moving out and will have nowhere to live. 

Does anyone have any advice, tidbits, anything, that might help this situation. Even just a statement that this is completely valid and they are simply out of luck will be helpful.

1. Is it possible (legal and recommended) to utilize federal loans to pay off private loans since the federal loans would be more favorable to pay off due to interest and being able to pay them off after my four years?

Below that statement it has our RV VIN which matches and our loan account # which matches.

It is then signed by a USAA FSB Rep and notarized/signed by a Notary in the state of Texas (where USAA is based).

I have two questions, one would be how do I go on about making a budget, and STICKING TO IT! Second would be, how do you advance further in the world. As i'm getting older i'm getting pretty nervous because I always thought i'd ""be okay"" when I was making 15-17 or so an hour and now i'm realizing how minimal pay it really is. I have side gig potentials but those all require me to have a good pc which I cannot currently afford. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any general advice on these topics would be greatly appreciated, some of the best advice (and trolls) I've ever received was on Reddit so i'm hoping to get something solid here.

t3_chbgvl,"Hi all. I am hoping for a bit of advice re student loans, real estate investment, and financial independence","I have been doing light research whenever I can find the time in-between work and study, but would much rather hear from people directly. Thank you in advance for tips and advice!

Background:
I am 30 years old. I just graduated law school with $130k in debt and I think the interest rates between 5.3-7.6%. Only 1/3 of these loans are for actual tuition, so Im 99% sure the loan forgiveness program wouldn't do much for me. I am looking into it now. I have $0 savings. I have a very meager financial support system that could only come into play for dire emergencies. The area of law, real estate (anything that offers me a position really) I intend on pursuing pays roughly $65k/yr starting. If I work like a horse, I can double that, which I intend on doing as soon as I pass the bar. My fiancé earns roughly $90k/yr and supports her parents. We do not have children yet. Neither of us own any substantial assets. She has $50k in savings. I live with my family. She rents. We intend on marrying in a couple years when we buy a house. We live in So Cal and because we will be supporting her parents, we expect to find a fixer-upper duplex in the $700-800k range.

I have, within the past year, started lightly reading finance and investment books and blogs, and have been playing with $1k in robinhood. In the near future, I would like to make investing a regular hobby and supplementary source of income to be spent on small/insignificant luxuries for my family. Once I have paid off a significant amount of student debt, I would like to start thinking of real estate investments. We have multiple close family members and friends involved in real estate in some capacity, so it would not be too substantial of a leap to go from this community's support and my exposure in real estate law, to real estate investing.

So I'm just wondering what similar experiences everyone here has had and what did/did not work for you. Should we put off buying a home until my loans are paid off? Should I accept that I will be paying off loans for the next 20 years and be willing to pay that interest rate so that I can do other things in life like buy a house, invest in real estate, and start a family?

t3_chba2w,Paying off 1/4 of student loans before I graduate college... good Idea?,"Hey guys- broke college student here! \[21, F\]

I am going to be a junior in college in September and I was messing around with the ""goal calculator"" tool on mint and found that if I pay $225 a month towards my two unsubsidized loans (out of the four loans I currently have, two of which are subsidized), one of which is **$6,452** with a **4.45 APR,** the other is **$3,638** (I've been paying it down little by little) with an **APR of 5.05**, In two years and 11 months, I could pay off **$10,090** of what will be around **$40k** in student debt (about 13 months after I graduate college).

Would paying **10k** of what will be **40k** in student loans ahead of time be worth it? Or should I leave this money in a savings account and/or keep for emergencies? This calculator says I would save **2,638** in interest by paying it ahead of time. I have around **7k** saved up from working and I'm paying for school by myself so I'll probably spend **3-4k** on room and board. I'll also be making around **400** a month with my job at school so I was thinking that I could try to only spend **150** a month on food and my friends are going to sneak me food from the dining halls :)

t3_ch8bf8,"Next step planning, a few questions.","Earlier this year I sold a few mutual funds in order to buy into this business with 7 other partners. It has been decided since it's split 7 ways, it isn't as profitable as originally planned, and a buyer is lined up now to buy the whole thing for original value plus some, since the business has a steady record now. (Route trucking business with Amazon). 

When I receive the money back, I'm not entirely sure how it'll be taxed, plus I don't know how taxes will be at the end of the year for selling some of my mutual funds and transferring it into this business.. 

A follow on question, with the money, should I go for investing the rest back into Vanguard into previous holdings, or should I consider putting money into my house? I purchased the home in March 2019, I put 0% down for the home, so at the moment it's mostly eaten by interest, on the flip side, I only plan on staying in the home for another 4-5 years and then selling it, so I don't know if putting money into the house is a good idea. Considering houses return 1.5-3% annually (I think that's correct) when stocks have been performing so much better, it seems like a waste. 

I currently max my 401k with employee matching and my IRA on the side with Vanguard. I have about a 20k emergency savings so that's not an issue, and I am going to reduce it soon, I've just been hesitant to lump a lot back into the market at once so I've been DCA, when I already have a good amount invested (around 200k).

t3_chb5tb,Roth IRA roll overs- keep separate from existing Roth IRA?,"So my husband got a roll over from an employers pension that went to vanguard Roth IRA (part was pre tax and part was after tax- the pre-tax went directly into a new traditional IRA account, the after tax into the roth).  He already had a roth IRA, just dumped it into that account and ordered to buy shares of the same target date fund that the rest of the roth is in.

Is there a down side to having this roll over funds merged with the account holding his yearly contributions?  The funds are after-tax and were rolled over directly by the company.  Its a matter of whether they should be in a separate roth account with the shares of the target date fund, or if they should just have been dumped in with the already existing roth account.",personalfinance

I am about to refinance my vehicle. I purchased it at $22k with interest rate of 5.99%, which made total payment to be $25,513 (including interest). Now it has $21.5k (I am refinancing after first payment).

As far as I understand, if I refinance it through bank, they will pay remaining $21.5k and I need to pay bank with lower monthly payment. But with all the ""total payment"" and other terminology makes it little confusion now. I feel like it is either of two:

1) like mentioned, bank pays off $21.5k and refinance.

2) bank pays ""total amount"" - how much I paid. Basically my total was $25,513 - $500, which is $25,013. Bank pays off this amount and I refinance with them, which increase the payment actually(?).

This idea confuses me a little. It feels like it is different from student loan refinance. Does anyone know how it works? If it does work like 2), why would anyone refinance?",personalfinance

t3_chat55,25. Not living paycheck to paycheck anymore. This is what I did.,"I spent the majority of my adult life training to be a chef. I dropped out of college junior year to pursue this passion. For anyone who has worked in the hospitaltity industry before, compensation isn't ideal; especially if you work in the kitchen. I am now working in sales making almost triple but these guidelines still apply. 

As friends were graduating college and starting their careers with ample pay, I was living paycheck to paycheck for almost 3 years. But I believe I took the right steps to help my future self. 

1. Say no. 
FOMO is a real. Believe me. When friends take weekend trips or go out for expensive dinners a lot, do not be afraid to say no. I have missed out on a lot of memories but I used the money I would spend to invest in my future.

2. Invest. Acorns and Robinhood are blessings from the heavens. 5-10% of my paycheck went into my robinhood account for almost 2 years. I am lucky enough to have a few friends that run an investing podcast so I learned a fair amount on how to make my money grow. 

3. Borrowing money should be your last resort. 
I went in about $300 in debt and paid it off within a month. You do not want money tied into friendships. If you do borrow money, have a plan right away. Tell said person you will pay them back by a certain point.

4. The liquor store is your friend. Want to go out drinking with your friends on night but dont want to spend a ton of money? Buy $50-100 worth of booze at a liquor store and pregame hard. If you are not an alcoholic, should last you a few months. 

5. Open a CD. A CD is a no touch savings that is not accessible for a period of time. Find one with no minimum and put 5-10% of each paycheck into it. Mine accrudes 2% a year. 

6. Find a second income. Stop watching TV and playing video games. I received my real estate license (which got me into sales) because I wasnt happy with my income. My plan was more long term but find something you can do 5-10 hours a week to fill your pockets. Strip for all I care. 

My fingers hurt so I am going to stop typing. If you want to know more just ask. If you want more money, make sacrifices and find a way.

Now I have around 16.5K in checking account The thing is, I will be going to graduate school soon and I am also applying to medical school (spent $1k on applications and I am planning to spend another $1K for secondaries RIP). I will be living in an apartment where I will be putting in around 1.1K a month for rent and utilities on an 11-month lease (already paid the security deposit). Since I want to focus most of my efforts on to my academics, I do not plan on earning money for the next 12 months. 

I do admit I have amazing parents; they insisted on paying for graduate school tuition for the first year instead of having me dish out a loan. I will have to pay them back once I make a steady flow of income (which may be 2-10 years from now depending on if I get accepted into medical school or I decide to continue down the MSBS path), but it is MUCH better than accruing interest on a student loan. They are also willing to cover for food if my money starts to deplete as long as I am spending a reasonable amount. 

That being said, since I will need to pay for rent, food and plane tickets for medical school interviews in the off chance that I school selects me (fingers crossed), should I even think about putting any of the money I have in a savings account? If so, how much should suffice?

I am interested in the cash out option, but I learned there would be a 20% tax rate on the money I get.

He told them they couldn't withdraw from their 401K (even though they are 65 and 62 respectively) but could if they rolled it over into an IRA.  Also they couldn't merge any of their funds (I assume for tax reasons).  They ended up rolling their money into a traditional IRA with Fidelity (from whatever other company they were at before) but it's not invested in anything yet. The advisor setup a followup appointment with them and gave them some material to look over before doing the investing and we're all a bit confused on it all.

&amp;#x200B;

First, they want to take about 1% fee of their worth in annual fees. Is this the norm in fees?  Essentially they want to manage the money and disburse the money to them every so often then collect their fees.  So they would essentially just receive a ""check"" that they could spend as their income every month. Is this the typical of how it works in retirement?

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot about setting up different accounts on this sub, and saving your 20% or so in E-funds, 401K, IRAs, HSAs, etc. But not much mention about what to do when it comes time to live off of that and not a steady income. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something they should be looking for, any questions they should be asking, anything we haven't thought of? It just seemed a bit strange to pay someone 1% fee (in I assume addition -- though maybe not -- to index fund or other account fees) to give you your own money each money.

t3_ch9zhv,My fiancee and I are moving into our first apartment together. Need help determining if we can afford it.,"Hello, r/personalfinance.

As stated above, my fiancee and I were just approved for moving into our first apartment together. We live in the Washington DC Metro area, which is one of the most expensive areas in the country in terms of rent.

We are moving to Reston, a very up and coming area in Northern Virginia. This area (and our new place) sit(s) along the city's new Silver Metro line. [The building](https://www.vyrestonheights.com/) is about 1 year old and in pristine condition, with incredibly comprehensive amenities. I work in Reston, and the apartment is a 10-15 minute walk and 4-5 min bike ride from the apartment. For my fiancee, the metro line goes directly to her work in about 30-40 minutes.

[***The apartment (AD1 Den or A02)***](https://vyrestonheights.securecafe.com/onlineleasing/vy-reston-heights/floorplans.aspx)***:***

* The 1-BR apartment we intend to rent costs \~$1835 not including utilities. It is a brand new space including a washer and dryer in unit.
* Utilities include power, water, trash, and internet. The power, water and trash costs are calculated by the building; the cost of these services is essentially divided among all tenants, according to the size of each rental space and the amount of tenants therein. Overall, we expect to pay \~$200 a month in utilities all things considered. Maybe slightly more. Meeting with the leasing office again today to get specifics. **All said and done, the apartment should cost \~$2000 including all utilities.**
* We are considering signing a 24-month lease; this would earn us 1.5 months free rent with the building, and we expect to live here for a while regardless.
* The area is growing and developing at an incredibly rapid pace, and rents are only rising.
* For what this building provides, its rent's are relatively speaking some of the lowest in the area; Other buildings like this offer similar spaces for $2000+ not including utilities.

***As for our finances:***

* At this time, our gross income each year is exactly $100k, and our net income each month is about $6000-6200.
* By Fall of next year, we are projected to both earn significant promotions and begin earning \~$150-155k (total).
* I also earn a monthly living stipend from the VA for my GI Bill that I am using to finish my bachelor's degree; these payments amount to between $1200-$2400 per month, depending how many days of each month I am in full-time classes (in months like August and December, these payments amount to the lesser amount as only half the month is spent in school).
   * These payments are due to stop in June of 2020 when I have graduated.

***In terms of debt and savings:***

* I have roughly $18.5k in checking and savings. I have $12k in debts from the past (long story) that are in collections that I'd like to pay off before we are married.
* She has no savings but $2.5k in debt.

I apologize if this counts as TMI or is too long, but I am just seeking third party opinions on whether or not we are proverbially flying too close to the sun here. Any constructive advice and criticism is welcome, and thanks for your help.",personalfinance

t3_ch9jqa,Employer Matching Previous Year's 401k Contribution?,"I took a position with a new company where I negotiated a 50% 401k match with my employer to start on Day 1 with zero contingencies whatsoever. I have a written and signed offer letter stating I will receive 401k matching at 50% of what I contribute. I contributed last year and this year at a rate to reach IRS maximum  contributions with the consideration that I would receive the employer match. 

One year after starting employment I have not received any 401k match (I'm contributing to the employer's 401k plan btw). I've emailed the president to document this in writing, I've spoken in person and over the phone with the president directly who promises to square us up after he ""talks with his accountant"". Well.... he spoke with his accountant and now he says HR will call me to facilitate the transfer. After a month of waiting I called HR and they still needed to talk to the President and they weren't prepared with the info needed to complete the transfer (that's what they are telling me). I wait another few weeks and the president drops by to tell me we won a new project. He mentions the 401k matching is still in the works. 

I really like my job and company. The workload is light and I make significantly more than the average person with my experience. I'm not looking to quit my job and I'm not looking to ruffle any feathers, all I want is my 401k match as agreed upon (+ the interest I've missed out on).

If I do receive the match for 2018, how do I ensure I'm not taxed as extra income? How do I facilitate the transfer to my 401k plan? Any keywords I can research on my own? I'm nervous my employer is going to issue it as a bonus and 1099 me (I'm a salaried employee), which as long as it's enough to cover taxes and is equal to the match plus interest,  I may be OK with.",personalfinance

t3_ch9i0y,Tips for Business Traveler/Digital Nomad - Home Ownership - Budgeting - Savings,"Hello PF!  I have been reading here for years, trying to absorb the knowledge that applies to me.  I've found myself in an interesting position lately.

Basically, I travel for work.  I am 30 years old, single, with no roots anywhere in the country.  My social connections are scattered all over.  I travel so frequently that I canceled my lease, ""moved into"" my parents place, and live my life on the road.  After a business trip, I do not have to go ""home"", as long as it's relatively within the realm of cost to get me home, I can go anywhere.  San Diego is my favorite.

I am staying in hotels 3-4 weeks per month.  As far as accounts go, I have a gold/platinum/ambassador account with Marriott, Hertz, Enterprise, Holiday Inn, anything I frequently use. 

My reimbursement/pay: I pay for everything through my own credit card, submit weekly expense reports, get reimbursed by Friday.  I spend about 2k/week on various things like food/hotel/car/flight.  I do not pay for my own... anything.  I basically exist with 0 financial burden currently.  Aside from that, I am a permanent employee, 401k match, great benefits, pulling around $85k/year before any other benefits like bonuses/reimbursement perks.

First up: Credit cards.  I went with Chase Sapphire Preferred.  Quickly regretted not getting Reserve, but I think I still have a good situation.  I'm over 200k points already.  Do I need to be doing anything else with this situation?  I see ""Churning"" and swapping to partners a lot, but I don't really see the value, I'm getting a great setup right now, looking forward to cashing the points on a grand vacation later this year.  

Savings: I put the bare minimum in my 401k currently as I'm trying to save for a home.  I put up to the company match, bank the rest of the cash, toss it in a 2.1 APY savings account.  Have about 40k in cash this way, around six figures in my 401k.  I have enough in my Roth IRA to pull the max allowed for a first time home purchase.

Living: Should I position myself in a state that has no income tax?  Is it worth the expense in moving/paying rent/mortgage?  What are your thoughts on buying a 3-4 bedroom home, renting the rooms out, and basically never being home?

Lastly: what would you do in my situation?  I am sure I am missing a lot of potential perks or things to help my situation, I got rushed into this position with very little planning time.

Thing is, I'm in this weird situation:

I'm a well-paid programmer who works as a contractor for a single company. I'm basically an employee, but get paid with a 1099. My ""employer"" had some cash flow issues so I got slowed paid on my ""paychecks"" (invoices) for nine months last year, and as a result I had multiple 30- and 60-day late payments on my primary and secondary mortgages. I had four 30-day lates and three 60-day lates across both mortgages between May and August last year. Other than that, I've never missed a payment ever.

My gross ""salary"" is close to $200K, but with expenses and deductions my taxes show I make around $75K. CreditKarma says my FICO is 729. Zillow says my house is worth $1.3M and I owe $543K so my current LTV is around 42%. I'd like to take out up to $100K which would push my new LTV to around 49.5%. I live in Orange County, CA so my understanding is that FHA limits in my area are $726K; however, I think my late payments disqualify me from FHA altogether?

I tried calling a couple lenders and they said they couldn't service me with any lates within the last 12 months or with more than one 60-day lates on my credit report. So while my 12 month window on any lates closes at the end of August, I won't be able to do anything about those 60-day lates for another six years. A friend of mine said he knows of a private investor who'd take my refi, but would want close to 10% interest.

Am I screwed? Any ideas how to get a refinance in the short term? Does anyone know of any lenders who would service someone like me at somewhere close rate to market (or at least less than 5% APR)? I'm trying to figure it all out, but it's hard to navigate.

t3_ch8wg3,Backdoor roth ira,"Having read the flow chart and doing as much required, I am now looking into ROTH IRA and its backdoor. Here are a few questions related to that. FYI, I cannot make deductible contributions to IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Can I max out my ROTH IRA and then start using backdoor ROTH IRA for 2019 ?

2) My reasoning for using backdoor ROTH IRA is that I do not have any immediate goals for the next 5 to 6 years. So I am thinking instead of parking my money in a savings account or using a brokerage account, I can use the backdoor ROTH IRA and get tax free earnings. If I need the money after like 5 or 6 years(which still has lower probability) I can just withdraw my contributions(assuming they hold in value) and not my earnings. That way I can avoid the penalties/tax implications of the earnings. Any thoughts ?",personalfinance
t3_ch8ul1,Refund Help and Disputes,"Hi I recently signed up for a trial on Codecademy Pro, a programming course website.  They charged $240 when my trial ended and I did not cancel it in time.  I didn't even know it was an annual subscription for the trial so I was shocked.  I have sent a request ticket through their website but their policy is that they don't do refunds surprisingly, so I am worried.  However, I canceled it right after they charged it through my paypal account.

Is there a way to cancel this fee through my bank, PNC?  I have no way to afford this and I'm so scared.  I used a debit card because I don't have a credit card which is even worse.  My bank said they will try to submit a dispute but they didn't really give me any assurance. 

It was only one hour since I got charged and I canceled it.  Can I possibly take out money out of my account so that the transaction doesn't go through and is canceled?  Is that a thing? Would codecademy be willing to refund me?  I have no idea what to do.

Edit:  didn't hear back from codecademy yet but looks like their policy is no refunds even on day 1 based on forums. Gonna try to learn from my mistake and use it or find someone who wants to buy it off me.   I asked if I could change from annually to monthly but I doubt they will be so kind even if I'm a student.

Edit 2:  happy update, they gave me a full refund! Other forums have posted but haven't got a response so I assumed they wouldn't refund.  But thank you codecademy!",personalfinance

t3_ch67bc,Unable to continue education due to debt. Unable to live without education due to debt.,"## Situation Summary

I am unable to take loans out myself to continue my education. So, I am wondering if any of Reddit's finest have experience with something similar and may have some guidance. 

## Situation in Detail

I am currently an Aerospace Engineering Student going into my Junior year with an expected graduation date of May 2021. Up until this summer, I have been able to take out personal student loans without a cosigner. This summer, I was denied an additional $50k for the next school year because of my current loans giving me too high of an outstanding balance. My Mother is on long term disability so she is unable to cosign for me and the rest of my family isn't in any better of a position, so no one is willing to cosign, not that I blame them since what I'm asking for is no small amount of money. 

I've worked at the same restaurant for the past ~7 years, so I have a great relationship and I make decent money, but I'm not sure I could survive on a servers wage with my current outstanding debt. If I had the opportunity I would get into engineering work immediately since I genuinely enjoy it, but as far as I can tell, I am invisible to Aerospace Companies until I get my degree. 

## Loans Breakdown

**Current Loans**

 Type | Amount | Term | APR % 
------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ 
 Private Student| $37,335.81 | 120 Months | 10.0 
Private Student | $46,135.52 | 180 Months | 11.250 
Unsubsidized Stafford | $2,000 | ?|5.0
Subsidized Stafford|$4500 | ?|5.0

I need about $90k-$100k more to graduate.

## My Options as I see it

 - Live as a Server in Poverty for the next ten-ish years.
 - Try to find a tech-related job and hope I get lucky and make enough to afford my loans and food. This would probably be harder short term but long term would pay off more than serving.
 - Use my savings to try and get a useful degree at a community college using my current credits.
 - Join the military? This one scares me, so I haven't looked into it. Might not even be an option. 
 - Runaway to Moldova where Sallie Mae can't find me.

t3_ch805s,"Realistically, will I be able to purchase a home by age 30?","Hello everyone and thank you for taking a moment to read this. 

I am turning 28 in just a few days. I've just begun my career as an airline pilot only a few months ago. First year pay isn't great, but it isn't terrible either. Anyway, I'll get right into it:

**My Debt:**

Currently I have a **total of $68,300 in student loan debt**. This consists of a **private student loan of $31,000 @ 4.25%**  and the remainder is in **federal loans varying from 3.5-4.5%**. I have been paying these down aggressively; I started with $96,000 total in student loan debt around the beginning of 2018 (I only started keeping track of my payments in Sept. 2018). Personally, I want this debt gone, asap.

**My Income**:

Currently, being so new to the company and just finishing training, having such low seniority, my pay isn't as much as it will be in the months to come. After taxes, health insurance payments, and 401k contribution (4%), **I make roughly $2,800 + per diem which varies from $300-600, per month.** As my seniority climbs and I earn more flying (work), I estimate this **will increase to roughly $3,500 - $4,000 per month**, before an hourly increase after my year anniversary in April. I also make \~$100-300/month from picking up random stuff on my days off and doing freelance transcription.

* **Potential Income:** I feel obligated to note that the potential earnings for an airline pilot are very nice. Of course, things can happen and I could fail to move up into a major airline, cargo, etc, such as another recession, my company experiencing a fatal accident, etc. The industry is very sensitive to these types of things and I feel it's worth noting. That being said, an upgrade to Captain at my current employer and/or a move to a major airline, cargo outfitter, etc. could put me well into the six figure range. Please, if you know someone who's had a bed experience with airline industry, I ask you to stay objective, because it can vary so much from person to person.

**My Living Situation:**

I am fortunate enough to have awesome parents that allow me to stay **rent-free at their homes** (they're divorced). In addition to that, we've made agreements that my car insurance and phone bill will be supported by them, as long as I'm willing to do all the yard work and maintenance, etc. that comes with a home and the four seasons of the Midwest. In addition to that, given that I'm on the road for a decent amount of the month, I barely pay for much groceries. **The downside to this: the drive to work is over an hour one way**. I don't enjoy this for many reasons that I'm sure most of you can sympathize with, so I won't get into the many reasons why.

**A Home???:**

So, finally, I ask, how in the world could I possibly afford to purchase a home and get out of my parent's homes around the age of 30? **I have almost no savings** besides a $1,100 ""emergency fund"". **75-90% of my take-home pay goes toward my student loans**. I have considered decreasing that and starting a fund for a down payment on a home, but only feel that will make things harder for me in the long run, as I will hold the student loan debt longer. I want to move closer to work, get out of my parents homes (because what 30 year old lives at their parents!?!), and truthfully because I want to be a home owner. **I have thought this: pay the student loan debt off in full as quickly as possibly and then immediately save everything I can for a down payment, and hope to be out of here before 31 (30, if I'm lucky).**

Side note: I have no interest in moving out just to move into an apartment because it's closer to work. I don't enjoy living in an apartment and the things I am able to do here at my parents consist of many outdoor activities that cannot be had while living in an apartment.

I am curious what current home owners and/or student-loan-debt holders think of my situation and the ultimate question, Will I be able to purchase a home by 30?",personalfinance

I have a credit score in the 800s, I'm 33 and have 3 open credit cards, 1 has zero balance Citi Simplicity(3 years old), the other Chase Freedom (oldest card 6+ years) has around $50-100 dollars each month that I pay off (another zero balance) and my most recent card Capital One Venture (travel reward card) has a balance for most of my expenses each month currently (1-2k) which I pay off each month for a 0 balance.  I will be putting part of my stuff in storage until I find a place (I will be staying with my brother for free) and a job.

&amp;#x200B;

We need an appraised value or a brokers price opinion value of 239K to be able to remove the PMI. If we are within about 5K of that then we would put the extra money into the equity to reach the 20% level.

Does anybody have experience with BPO's? Do they typically provide reasonable estimates?

I am calculating that we would need our house value to have increased about 2% each year to get to the level we need to remove the PMI.

We have not done any major renovations except for a new roof.

There was also a day where i paid $30 but ended up with 3 transactions going through. No money ever exchanged without communication so I can prove that they are not mine through phone records and such. What makes me think it's not fraud is because the money has ended up in her account. She has not had the opportunity or technical knowhow to pull something like this off.

I actually don't know where to start &amp; what to ask. Well, I want to start, but there's something that keep holding me back, for a year already. Has anyone in your personal experience, been through something like this and how did you make the jump?",personalfinance
t3_ch7auc,When to give myself permission to spend,"I know questions like this can be tricky so I'll do my best to paint my financial picture. I'm 37, have no debt outside of my mortgage and an overall net worth just over a million. I tend to be inconsistent with how and when I spend money from things like bonuses and stock options. I was wondering if there are some good rules of thumb on spending/saving ratios of dollars that are outside normal income stream. I'll never be the person to say ""spend it all!"" but I do feel like sometimes I'm not enjoying the ""now"" as much as maybe I should be.",personalfinance
t3_cgydsc,Does economic hardship lead to a fear/anxiety of spending money?,"I grew up lower middle class and sometimes skirting the edge of impoverished. I'd spend the school year with my dad where things were a fairly stable. I'd most often spend the summer with my mom, who's economic status was much more shaky. Sometimes, there wouldn't be any food for days except a couple cans of soup. I remember once trying to eat cool whip as a meal. My stomach hurt so bad after that hahaha.

&amp;#x200B;

A year after high school I joined the Navy and spent ten years doing that. I was much better off financially, but I spent that time in the military during the recession. I was afraid to leave the military, despite the severe depression it gave me, because of the recession. So I stayed in. I was able to buy a house, which I now rent. I was also able to start saving for retirement. When I left, I started school (again) and basically went from receiving a decent paycheck to getting a couple grand a month during school months. My dad was kind enough to take me in while I went to school, which massively helped me out financially, but that only lasted a couple years before I couldn't stand living there anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I moved out and rented a *very* small bedroom. During the past couple years, I was making nearly no money. So I socked away every penny I could. And, when I was on my own, I filed for disability with the VA and started getting a reliable chunk of change every month. I was still struggling, but I continued to stash every dime I could. I was saving money because I was so afraid of some non-existent emergency (which is not unreasonable). I also continued contributing to my retirement accounts because I've always believed that I'd rather be poor when I'm young than when I'm elderly.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've graduated and I'm starting a new job next month that has health care, dental, vision, a lunch stipend, and, most importantly, a consistent paycheck. That money, along with my tax-free disability and rent from my house, will actually put me in a financial utopia compared to my past situations.

&amp;#x200B;

To get to my point... the other day I got a letter from Ally. I had totally forgotten that I had a savings account with them. There's $2300 in there. From putting away every dollar I could, my regular savings account has $11k (side note: it had about $20k from disability backpay, but I spent a huge portion of it to fix my car and feed myself while out on my own), I have $1800 in cash in my sock drawer, and I also have a about $77k in my retirement accounts (age 32) which I had continued to contribute to even during my ""poorest"" moments. 

&amp;#x200B;

With all this money saved, I should be feeling comfortable, right? I don't. I feel huge amounts of anxiety and stress every time I'm faced with having to spend more than $50. I've been thinking about this and have come to wonder if my past experiences with not having much money have caused me to hoard it versus *saving* it. Am I stashing money away at such a degree that it's actually harmful?

t3_ch746f,Insurance instrument to pair with term life that assists with catastrophic illnesses,"Ive almost exclusively seen critical illness riders paired with whole life or universal life insurance policies. These seem to usually not be a good idea. 

While many term policies come with an accelerated death benefit rider that allows you to access a percentage of the benefit (I’ve usually seen 25 or 50 percent) if things are truly dire (often less than a year to live) I’m having trouble seeing how to insure oneself for a long term illness like Alzheimers or dementia that may not have as short of a lifespan but would still be debilitating. Long term care and long term disability insurance appear incredibly expensive. 

Can you take a massive loan against your life insurance to get the money for nursing care in a situation like that? What other options exist for complex medical cases like Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, or other catastrophic illnesses?",personalfinance

t3_ch5867,Applying for a credit card,"Hi all,

I’m 24 and never really built any credit on my own. All of my purchases have been through my debit card since I turned 20. I bought a car recently and payed it off (double payments) thinking it would be good for my credit. It dropped me from a 740 to a 660 and to follow that someone had fraudulently opened a card in my name and purchased an iPhone (called the credit bureaus, called the store the phone was purchased from, filled a police report, found out where the phone was sent to, called local department there and had the phone confiscated).

t3_ch430k,"After over 5 years of next to no income, I have finally been hired at a job that pays more money in one month than I have had in the past several years","Hey all, so I ended up dropping out of college from illness, and instead of going back, I decided to start my own business. In many ways our first project succeeded, but I worked on it less for profit, and more for the confidence I needed to keep moving forward in my career path. It's safe to say that while working on it, I didn't have much in the way of payment. Since the end of that project, I have been trying to get a job in my field (that’s where most of my skills and specializations lie). After a bunch of hardships that hit me in the meantime (mostly multiple family deaths and grief), I got set back. I don’t have savings anymore, next to zero net worth to my name, and I am pretty much relying on the charity of my friends and family.

Well, in a stroke of equal mix serendipity and personal growth on my part, I was able to land a solid job contract in my desired field. Now I have gone from zero income and near homelessness, to making over $5000 USD a month (gross income, before taxes and fees).

Now for the first time in like ever, I will have capital to work with. I will have gained the means to build an actual stable foundation for my life. But it’s overwhelming. I have student loans in default. I managed to keep up with credit card payments with gig work, but recently, I have entered into the loss department of the credit union I use as a “bank”.

I just want some tips and help for what would be a decent path forward for me to consider.

So details:

* I make about $5000 a month, about 32 dollars an hour.
* My contract lasts 15 months, then I will have to take a break with the company and that job role, unless I get hired as an actual employee.
* I have about $3000 dollars in debt for my credit card
* I have a student loan from more than one servicer but mostly the government I have to manage, and I have no idea where to begin. The debt is about 80k.
* I own a truck, but it needs maintenance; it is paid off.
* I own a computer, a cell phone (am on a family plan), and some tech tools.
* I am living at a relative’s who is okay with me staying here for a little longer while I get back on my feet. I don’t have to pay rent right now, but now that I have work that may change. The previous agreement is for me to stay here until February of next year.

The biggest thing in front of me is that credit card that just entered the Loss Department. I have contacted them, and they will likely call me back soon. I don’t want to mess this up. Do I pay it all off in one go? What kind of payment plan is reasonable? Do I build up savings first? I haven’t even started work yet, and it is unclear when my first paycheck will arrive, is there a point to keeping my Credit Union aware of what’s going on before I know more?",personalfinance

&amp;#x200B;

If I did my maths right, I'm left with $800/month for living expenses like grocery, auto expenses, clothing myself and child, providing other child related expenses.   


I have $0 in retirement funds, I have $0 in savings. I realize I shouldn't even think about that until I have some of this debt paid off.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the obvious answer here is; pay off that $700 CC (quick pay-off frees up $50/mo) then attack the Highest APR from there. But that literally is going to take me 5-8 years to get this all paid off at that rate.

I work 50-60 hours a week and the free time I have left is spent with my child or home eating/sleeping, and going to gym to stay healthy (physically and mentally)   
The only outlet I have that isn't really necessary is Netflix and that's only $13/mo which doesn't really seem to be too bad.

If I consider I have $800/mo for living, that leaves about $200-250 a month of that for paying extra on debt. I've plugged all my debts in to a debt payoff planner ([Powerpay.org](https://Powerpay.org)) and that's where the 5-8 years came from.  


Thoughts? I guess I see the reality here, it's just self defeating to see it. But I figure in case I missed something someone here may know.

These numbers are not temporary ""burner"" numbers, but are a legitimate card number with expiration date (2024) and three digit security code.  I know they work great for transactions that I initiate, like buying things on amazon.  What I don't know is how specific/restricted they are.  I am wondering if I can use them for recurring payments from other billers, like my phone bill or electric bill.   If anyone has much experience with the virtual numbers from Capital One, I would appreciate any answers you might have to the following questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Are these numbers general purpose credit card numbers that can be used anywhere online, or are they restricted to the website they were created for?
2. Has anyone successfully used them for recurring (autopay) payments?  I am thinking about using it for services like AT&amp;T, Electric Co, Cricket, etc. etc.",personalfinance

My mother suggested transferring the title over to me instead. The house is paid off, so at first I didn't see any issues. Then I started thinking about liability with tenants, property taxes, how this would (if it even does) affect my chances at securing an FHA for my own home in the future.

The job pays $30k for the first 3 months, then $35k for the next 3, then $40k until promoted (likely about a year).

I have ~$26k in student loans that are a mix of private and federal and result in ~$300 a month in payments currently (while paying the minimum). I’m currently paying $425 a month in rent but that’s about to go up to $725. I really try to reduce other costs, but spend at least ~$100/month for public transportation and around $160/month on groceries.

I currently live in a major city, but if needed can move home to a small city in the Midwest to live with my parents. I would likely be able to get a job that pays $35k and would essentially have no expenses, which would allow me to make a significant dent in my loans. However, I’m worried that moving home will make me complacent and isolated, and unlikely or harder to return to a major city.

Edit 2: Wow, I did not expect this many responses. Thank you for everyone who took the time to give their input! Some additional details (not that I really expect anyone to care lol, but because people have asked):

-The current job is technically in PR rather than marketing, which might help to explain the lower salary. I actually turned down several other offers that paid significantly more, because they both were in NYC and I really didn’t want to move there. I also accepted this job as opposed to the others (which were more of an analyst/data analytics role) because I wanted something more creative and less of staring at spreadsheets all day. However, I’m also considering moving away from business all together in the next few years to pursue something more people-oriented such as being a counselor or speech language pathologist, which is why going home to pay off loans quickly is a consideration.",personalfinance

Called them as soon as I woke up and looked like my card had been used at a string of places overnight, racking up about $150. The charges were reversed, card number cancelled, and a new one being shipped. Then about 8 hours later I get a text and email from Amex saying my account is locked due to many login attempts. Went to their website (directly, not through any email links) and sure enough, it was. Unlocked and changed password using my password manager. Then, fast forward about 14 hours, I get an email from Bank of America that my account is locked. Same process.

I'd like to assume this is all just a coincidence, but reality is there may be something malicious going on here. What should I do proactively (if anything) and any guesses as to what may be going on?

&amp;#x200B;

**--UPDATE--**

Thank you all for the suggestions and input. 

I think I've determined that the Discover card fraud and Amex/BoA lock outs are isolated yet related incidents. A critical detail I had not considered was after I got off the phone with Discover early yesterday morning they advised me to change my password on all other online banking accounts as a best practice, which I then did. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just spoke with a representative from Bank of America who indicated the login attempts did not originate from the online banking website or application but rather a ""3rd party system"" - they suggested I check any apps I have that integrate with my online banking. After thinking about it for a bit, I remembered I used to use an app to tracking monthly category spending (won't mention it's name as to arouse speculation of advertising again) and sure enough when I opened the app up for the first time in months it was alerting to a ""login issue"" for my BoA and Amex accounts. My theory is the app was continuously trying to log in to my accounts using an old password - essentially a non-malicous brute force attack of my own doing. I've unlinked the accounts from the app, permanently deleted the account with the app, and uninstalled the app from my phone as a precaution. Time will tell if this was truly the root issue or if it was something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I feel a bit silly about the latter, the Discover card incident was truly fraudulent and is being addressed - nonetheless I'll be keeping a close eye on that account now. As a precaution I've re-confirmed the credit freezes with the bureaus, scanned my computer for malware (finding none), and enabled two factor authentication on my e-mail account.

Grandmother has developed Alzheimer's/dementia. Disease has progressively grown worse to the point of being unmanagable. Situation is causing tremendous hardship/stress.

There are safety issues with Grandmother being unattended, and there is a constant paranoia that she might wander out of the home in the middle of the night.

When we went under contract we pre-approved with one of the builder’s recommended lenders at (big bank) due to ease and the relationship, with every intention of shopping around later. 

Right now (big bank) is suggesting that we consider putting less down upfront and to take a jumbo loan through them at a lower interest rate. Since we started the loan application last year we are grandfathered into 2018 conforming limits. The loan comes with the ability to recast for free whenever we want. So the idea is that we’d close at a lower interest rate and put less cash down, and recast after closing to where we want to be. 

Our purchase price is around 650k and originally planned on putting down 250k. 

The jumbo loan rate they’re offering (as of last week) is 3.75% with about $3k in lender credits towards closing. I’m able to get about the same rate (maybe slightly lower) with a different lender as a conforming loan, but I also miss out on the lender credits. For reference, (big bank)’s conforming rate on the same day was 3.875%.

Calculating the cash we’d spend up front, the extra interest we’d be paying monthly, and the recast payment, it appears to be pretty much a wash versus the most competitive conforming offer I’ve received from different lenders, with the added benefits of:

-	ability to recast for free in the future
-	being able to sit on the extra cash during the move and a baby born at end of year
-	we can still afford the increased monthly payment (under 20% DTI)
-	lender has a relationship with builder
-	(big bank) would service the loan for the lifetime of the loan, not have to worry about it being resold

So...is this a good deal? Could there be gotchas I’m not seeing? Should I just keep it simple and stick with a conforming through another lender? Are there questions I should ask?

&amp;#x200B;

Info:

\- I'm a Canadian grad student that is graduating in a few months with no debt of any kind.

\- I'm expecting to earn approximately 110k (CAD) a year. However, there will likely be no benefits or pension.

\- I believe that in the first year after school I should focus on becoming competent in my new career and save aggressively for a down payment on a house (or even a duplex for the rental income).

\- I think I will also start putting some money into an RRSP (similar to American's 401k account), however not too much as I would like to focus on saving for a downpayment on a house so that I no longer need to pay rent.

\- As the government-funded health plan is pretty good and I'm a young adult with no current health issues, I don't foresee myself getting private health insurance for at least a couple of years.

\- I currently have a 9-year-old car that I will drive as long as it runs, after which I will likely purchase a decent used vehicle (&lt;10k) and drive that one for years.

\- &gt; I believe that after taxes and my expenses (rent or mortgage, RRSP, bills, groceries, and leisure) 

**I will have approx 50k / year in savings.**

If I use the card between the due date (the 20th) and the ""ending date"" statement (the 27th), will I be charged interest?

From what I can glean from similar posts, should I pay everything by the due date, then continue using the card and just not worry about the ""ending date"" statement at all (except for staying within utilization ratios)? Or do I pay on the 20th, then use the card again, and then pay it off again by the 27th?

t3_ch301k,50% Pay Increase vs amazing benefits?,"Greetings everyone

&amp;#x200B;

I work in IT for a small college in the North East US.  I've recently received a job offer from another company for a 50% pay bump.  I am married, and my wife is about 8.5 months pregnant with our first child.  The company I'm currently with (10 years) has agreed to jump 12% immediately, then another pay bump in a department reorganization a month or two down the road due to the way their budget works.  This would put me at close to a 25% pay increase from my current salary. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are some things I'm concerned about new company, one being that there isn't really a job description for my position as it is a new position. I've asked what they want me to be doing and they touched on a few different things, but no clear answer.  The other being that this company is going through an insane growth spurt, so they very well could top out and my position be eliminated.  On the other hand, this new position could offer growth opportunities, and the yearly bonus is a 6% increase alone in pay over where I'm at currently.    The new company knows that my wife is pregnant, and is fine with me taking time off once the baby arrives, but it will be unpaid. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the flip side, I really enjoy the culture and benefits that my current company offer.  I have paid holidays, 2 weeks off paid in December, an ungodly amount of sick time, and vacation time that I really have to try and use to even put a dent in them. My wife is due around our fall semester - which is our busy time, and my boss didn't even fret at 2-3 weeks off for paternity leave. Add that in with a great relationship with my boss, teammates, and peers - so if I need to take a day off, it isn't even a question, and you have an extremely hard decision that I'm asking internet strangers for advice on.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know the general response is never take a counter offer from your current company.  My scenario is different, I've worked here for 10 years and this company knows that I want to stay.  I think long term, I will have to leave.  Is it a smart decision to leave stability in the middle of a life-changing event?  We are a single income family with a 6-month emergency fund in the event that something doesn't work out.  I'm hoping there are others who have had a similar situation and can share their side.  A majority of people in my life say to stay where I'm at, at least short-term while we get used to being new parents.  Am I stupid for even considering not taking this 50% pay bump (vs \~25% counter offer)?

t3_ch0lgm,Condo insurance possible double payout?,"**Background:** 
I own the condo that I am referencing and the HOA has 'walls-in' insurance which covers improvements/betterments.

**Situation:** 
I live on the 4th floor of a 7 storey condo building. About a month ago, we had a leak that originated on the 6th floor due to a failed toilet supply line. It leaked from the 6th floor all the way down to the 1st floor. The HOA called in the water remediation guys on the night of the leak and they had set up the fans and dehumidifiers which ran for about 10-14 days before reaching what they called 'industry dry' standards. The HOA instructed the unit owners to call our own insurance to get a claims process started. Luckily, my insurance has been fairly responsive and we had an adjuster come out two days after the leak. My insurance came back with an amount (around ~$10K minus deductible) which would cover replacing all of the hardwood floors, ceilings and walls of the affected areas. I had received a call that my check is already in the mail and that I would be receiving it shortly. Two days ago the HOA brought along their adjuster along with a general contractor. They seem to have the same assessment as my adjuster with regards to what needs to be replaced. I spoke with our community manager and the board member who was present, and it seems like the associate has already filed a claim to have everything replaced. From my understanding, if I decided to handle it myself through my insurance, I would be responsible for picking out the contractors and etc but I would rather have my HOA handle everything instead of coordinating everything myself. 

**Question:** What happens to my insurance payout now that the HOA has filed a separate claim to have everything fixed/repaired? 

Also, if anyone has been through a similar experience and have any recommendations on next steps, I would greatly appreciate and guidance/tips.

THANKS!

It hasn’t even been a week at this new position and I’m already starting to not like where I’m at, and I’m curious to see if this is the norm. This is my first position in the federal government and I have no idea about any of the finance stuff. Some observations:

· I had no idea where to go on my first day after orientation. Someone had to show me. Luckily it was in the same building.

· I was shown to my office, which was very dirty and unorganized. Pretty sure there is mold coming from the air vent above the desk.

· My supervisor has taken me around to meet a few people, briefly.

· I’ve spent the majority of my time sitting at a desk and reading various documents that the person left behind for me (no computer access because I don’t have a CAC yet).

· I’ve briefly spoken to the people that I’m supposed to be supervising, who seem helpful, but have been doing my job for a few months now and they’re more than deserving of having my job. But instead, with that MSP, that matters more to the hiring process than experience…

· For the amount of work these people are doing, they are severely underpaid.

· The bathroom is absolutely awful, dated, dark, mildew-y.

· The breakroom is an office that’s refitted to be a breakroom. The building doesn’t have much in the way of collaboration spaces. The building shape consists of | and \_\_, if that makes sense. Just hallways upon hallways of offices. I really hate that everything is so closed off or linear.

· The federal benefits aren’t exactly…. What I’m used to. At my old job, we accrued 8 hours of leave per bi-weekly pay period. You have to work in a federal job for 15 years before you earn that rate. Until then, you’re stuck with 4 hours for years 1-3.

· No family days off. You either have to take PTO or unpaid leave. The military allows for an extra day after a holiday to spend with family. (i.e. Black Friday).

· There is no water/coffee in the breakroom. The only water around comes from a cooler in another wing that employees PAY to use. There are also no paper towels, tissues, or any kind of items like that. One microwave.

· My supervisor is insanely busy, but I’ve gotten the feeling that they’re very stand-offish. My old boss was very personable and he was probably the best manager I’ve had. He was a very busy employee as well, but he made time for me and made me feel welcome – even took me to a first-day lunch.

· It wasn’t until my third day in until my supervisor discussed the expectations for me.

· This isn’t the type of environment where people seem to be friends with each other here. At all of my old jobs, the people around the office had no problem talking to each other about their lives, being friendly, and sometimes hanging out outside of work. That’s not the vibe I get here. I get the vibe that everyone comes to work, does their 8 hours, then goes home. Those kind of cultures really frustrate me, as I would think you’d want to enjoy to coming to work every day and friendly co-workers really help that when the job gets tough.

· There is so much to learn that I frequently get overwhelmed. I remember this being a problem at my old job, but I feel as though I was able to learn the ropes pretty quickly and I wasn’t just stuck on my own, especially for the first few days.

I’ve been having a lot of anxiety about life in general since the move and I thought that having a job would make it better. I have an appointment on base to discuss mental health because I cannot remember a day where I haven’t cried about something. If I had interviewed here and was offered the job, I probably would have declined due to the culture and the cold feeling that I get from being here. The HR people that helped me were great, but the department I’m in contains silos and just a very cold feeling.

I will certainly give this place a chance; maybe it will change when I get access to a computer and I’m not just sitting around all day waiting for something (I have asked around for things to do, but it’s a bad time of the month and everyone is busy meeting deadlines). But I am considering quitting due to this culture; the last few days have been very hard to adjust to, and while it has helped to type it all out, it’s hard for me to wrap my head around this place and that I’ve never quit a job after just starting before. My reasons could be all petty, but I'm just not happy here and figure that this wasn't the right path for me. I do have Lean Six Sigma certs that I could utilize for various things. I also have a wide variety of hobbies that I could do for money in the meantime while we are here.

I see people all the time that rant and rave about the benefits of a federal position, but I'm not seeing any of them right now :(",personalfinance
t3_ch2gma,Questions about HSAs,"I recently learned about the tax advantaged strategy of using an HSA as a form of retirement savings and I’m interested in trying it out. My personal situation is a bit complicated though and I have some questions mostly about qualification.

I have independent health insurance. It does not meet the qualifications for me to open an HSA because my Out Of Pocket Maximum (OOPM) payments are too high on my current plan. My deductible is above the minimum requirement, but that doesn’t matter since my OOPM is above the maximum limit set by the government to qualify to open an HSA. 

My wife is employed by a company that will allow her to start an HSA. They limit enrollment to May 1st - May 31st or if there is a qualifying life event so we’ll have to wait until next year to open one. 

I have three questions. 

1.	We file taxes jointly so when she opens an HSA will we be able to contribute the $7,000 max for a family or will she be limited to a $3,500 individual max contribution since we’re not insured by the same people?  Side question to this, will we only be able to use the HSA to pay for her medical expenditures in the future or will mine qualify as well?

2.	Why would her employer limit the enrollment period to one month or a qualifying life event?  What’s the logic behind that?
3.	Why does the government put a limit on the OOPM payments when considering if your High Deductible Health Plan meets the qualifications for you to open an HSA?  I understand the high deductible part of that equation, but why would they care about a maximum limit for the OOPM?

Any insights or answers would be greatly appreciated!",personalfinance

t3_ch2dxw,Thinking about liquidating to fully pay for my first place,"Hey all - 

Looking to buy a condo between 160-200K and debating doing it in cash.

A few facts about my situation:

- Wife and I make 280K pre-tax per year
- No debt, no kids, no plans for kids
- Wife has 40K in her 401K and I have 160K this money will not be touched
- We have ~ 30K combined in our HSAs this money will not be touched
-  We have ~200K in a vanguard brokerage account we are considering liquidating to pay for the home.
- We would have ~20K emergency fund still after this purchase.


We haven't quite locked in the condo of choice yet, so we would likely be prematurely liquidating, but then holding it in a high yield savings account till we pull the trigger in the next 6 months. 

With this paid off home I'd have an extremely high piece of mind and with such low monthly expenses or lean FI number would be only $300,000 (1K monthly expense) with normal FI at $600,000.  

With our existing assets and future income we could achieve this and beyond in no time.

Any real issues with this approach?

To recap : Liquidate the brokerage accounts now, pay for the condo, and then just keep saving for very quick lean FI followed by full FI with a paid off condo.",personalfinance

Rent is $6.000 (now its $9.000 because I live with my gf's brother and he lost his job... Twice), expenses, taxes, blabla, total of $12k for living.

I work in a big mall. I always forget to cook food and take it to work, so I keep spending money on Burger King, Wendy's, etc. Also, I take an Uber almost every week that costs me a lot of money, but I dont care anyway.

My salary is actually really good for a simple seller (I work for a big international telecommunication company) but Im starting to struggle a lot with my debts.

My debt is now on +$50.000 ARS.

I want to be debt free and at the same time, I have to save money for the rent's contract renewal (i think is called like that) or to move to a new place, and it can cost me up to $50.000k also.

What the fuck can I do to control myself? Does any of you guys have any tips on how to save money? I'm a very compulsive buyer and I'm always wasting money on food, Uber and random shit.

Should I pay lump-sum or just increase my monthly payment to knock off some of the principal? My thought is that if the interest is constantly re-calculated, the lump sum would save me money.

t3_cgzit3,Student Loans for my final year of Grad School - how much should I take and should invest anything now?,"Alright so as the title states I am entering my final year of grad school (unless something changes I suppose). I'll have a Master's and can really start looking for a career. Here's my finances at the moment:  


* $750 in Savings 
* $2800 in Checking
* My parents offered me $3000 which I can take now or later

&amp;#x200B;

And my expenses 

* Living with my parents for the summer, so other than maybe getting Taco Bell or going to the movies I won't be spending much. I mean I already spent $20 on New Coke because I like *Stranger Things*, but the point is I don't have ongoing expenses, yet.
* I go back to campus at the end of August, but I do have to pay for August. Luckily, my rent is just $430/mo. No utilities, unless I go over a certain amount that most tenants don't surpas. I'll have to be more careful with the AC, but that's about it. 
* I have $39,675 in loans already (5.1%).
* For this semester I owe $5,959.46.

&amp;#x200B;

I live close enough to walk to class, but I will still have a car if I get a job I need to drive to. Unfortunately a $47,000/yr position didn't go through, despite me feeling the phone interview went well, but that's getting off topic. I'm not in the city where my campus is located so job searches can be a bit hard, but I know even a minimum wage job is $11/hr. Although I have three classes I have pretty good time management, so while I probably won't be able to get a 40/hr a week job (at least not without tweaking my schedule) I plan on working a fair amount (I need to work it's just about the finding the where).  

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that is enough detail. The question I'm asking is essentially how big of a loan should I take out? Last year I decided to pay most of tuition with a loan and use the money I had saved to pay for rent and whatnot, which worked out and I was even able to pay for a summer class with no loan. Now, and please correct me if I'm wrong, I believe with student loans you take out an amount for the academic year. This is frustrating because I don't know what my finances will be like next semester and I want to minimize the amount of loans I take out. Also I've only ever used Federal loans, they always seemed like the smarter choice, but let me know more about private loans if they might help me more. As far as I know they generally have lower fixed rates and you can do income repayment plans, plus student loan forgiveness (if I were to a year in the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps for example), but let me know if they might be better. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the second question I had was what should I do with the remainder? I've been told it is best to pay off what you can when you can, so I'm prioritizing taking out the smallest loan I can and using what I have to pay tuition. Again, let me know if this is a sound decision.  I put the $750 in savings with the idea I wouldn't touch it. I would let grow ever so slightly over the years and only put money in, unless there's some emergency. So should I put any in a mutual fund (and how would I even do that), should I invest in stocks? My family has almost no experience with this, I think someone was ripped off in a penny stock scam and I've often viewed it as a ""rich person thing,"" so that's probably why I've avoided them, but if you can point me towards good resources I would appreciate it. Are there other safe ways to let improve my future finances?

I have been training for a new job as an outside sales rep for a company that distributes automation equipment to factories. The company currently has four other sales rep, two of which have been at the company for over 15 years. Hopefully this means this will be more of a long term position for myself.  

I currently drive an old beater ford explorer I got for 2 grand. It has served its purpose, but is getting the the point that the repair costs don't make sense anymore. The job comes with a 400 dollar a month allowance for a vehicle, so I think it is about time that I look for a new vehicle. I am running into two issues:

1) My current compensation package gives me a decent yearly base salary and commission on sales. With this I also receive the $400 a month car allowance, 25 cents a mile, and $100 a month for cellphone. This compensation package changes (when I decide) to a commission only model that loses the perks and base salary. I asked my boss how long other sales reps have waited to make the change and was told around 2 years. 

2) I am a pretty outdoorsy person. I have a boat that i tow with my explorer (around 3500 pounds) and am constantly doing projects. I also play music for extra money, and have a good bit of gear that doesn't fit in a regular car. Because of this, I am debating what type of vehicle I should be looking at. Obviously I understand that resale value and mpg is important, but considering I need a bigger vehicle should I get a sales focused car and a truck separately, or just get a newer truck like the 2.7 ecoboost that gets 22 mpg? Considering the size of my territory, I am planning on driving around 25k miles a year. 

I am a 24 year old male, so I can only assume that insurance rates are not going to be great no matter what. I on spending around 20k on whatever 2-4 year old vehicle I get. Considering my wants and situation what would others recommend?

t3_cgecxi,Wife and son recently killed in a car accident... Help me handle my next financial decisions rationally,"Hi PF, I've been a longtime lurker, but now I'm in need of rational advice.

Like the title says, my wife (26) and son (1.5) were recently driving down to see her parents, and were killed in a car accident. I think I'm still in shock, and the reality of that statement hasn't really hit me. I've not shed a single tear, and just kind of felt like a zombie, or like I'm living in some fake dream world.

I know I need counselling to deal with all that, but I want to make sure that I don't make any dumb financial mistakes in the wake of this, which is why I came here.

Here's my situation: 28M, sole earner for the family at about $70k/yr. Currently own a home with about 250k left on the mortgage at 4.375% and a car with about $8k left at 3.5%. My wife had life insurance that's going to end up being $300k. I don't have a ton saved for retirement, but I contribute 8% to my 401k which is to take full advantage of the employer match. I think the total in that account is around $40k. I also have an emergency fund with about 3-4 months worth of expenses saved up.

My gut reaction on what to do with the life insurance is to pay off the mortgage to free up my monthly cashflow, and allow me to put more into my 401k. I know we bought more house than we probably should have, (EDIT: to clarify this point, I mean that our mortgage was probably too much for our income. The house itself is only around 1000sqft. We are in a HCOL area) so we've not had a ton of room in our budget month to month. If I pay off the mortgage, that opens up a lot of room to put more into my 401k, but I also know that PF doesn't usually recommend paying off low interest debts early.

Any other considerations I should be thinking about? I'm going to set aside a chunk for funeral expenses, but even with that, I should still have enough to pay off all my debts and put more into an emergency fund",personalfinance

Wife is saying we should just cash out the car, as it's paying interest vs earning interest, however when I plug the numbers in to the CD calculator, the CD is making slightly more due to compounding interest.

Is this basically a wash to go either way?

Edit to add we would keep rolling into another CD after 3yrs. Also the total interest earned on CD vs paid on loan is within $30 total. So I was more weighing the chance of the car getting totaled and losing on that end.",personalfinance

About my situation:

I just graduated college and landed a job with a government agency which will be paying me 65k a year or ($5359 monthly). I want to spend my money responsibly and not just go crazy on dumb stuff. I currently owe 13k in student loans and about 1k in credit card debt. My new job requires me to have a reliable car, so I probably have to buy a new one (my current car is giving up on me). I also don't want to get tricked into a high APR rate which freaks me out. In other expenses I pay about $600 in rent and about $200 dollars in random stuff.

My savings were emptied as a down payment on this car since my old one died suddenly.

All of my applications into better jobs have either been declined or heard nothing back from. I’m ready to give up. What can I do? I got scammed so hard by the dealership and I didn’t realize it until I was at a point where my down payment was non refundable.

&amp;#x200B;

While traveling last week, Citibank marked my account as deceased. I phoned in to sort things out and was told to speak with security/fraud department, that dept. told me I needed to speak with probate.  Citibank admitted that it was their error and it was someone else by the same name who died earlier this year.  They were adamant that this is extremely rare.  The probate office told me it could take anywhere from 5-30 days to clear up.   The only real help I got was when I ran into a friend via FB who works for Citi and she got me in touch with an executive office.  They went back and forth with me for a day and seemed to get things cleared up end of last week.  What's in question is if any of this will hit lexisnexis &amp; the credit bureaus.  I got the mail this afternoon and there's a collection agency notice for my Citibank account.  I left a detailed VM for the exec office person who worked with me last week and they are closed at the moment.

I've had this loan for the past three years and I've just realize only recently that it has an interest rate on it the longer I don't pay it. I took out $5,400 from them with an interest rate of 8.99%. Currently the interest has accumulated to $1,266. I'm estimating I'd owe around $7,300 by January. I'm taking one class next semester so I'm planning on saving money starting September specifically for paying off the loan. I will also be transferring to another school for my Bachelor's degree so I can delay the payment again.

I can accumulate about around $6,255 by Jan 7 with my current job if I did 35 hrs a week. The other issue is that once I transfer to this new school I'd likely be taking on more loans (Probably a subsidized loan not a private student loan) but it would be relatively low since I'd be commuting + financial aid + grants. So what would be the best way to solve this issue? My parents told me its better if I just waited until I graduate or at least get a job pertaining to my major (Network Admin/IT). So from what I figured, my options are these:

1. Get a second job so I can indefinitely pay it off by Jan.

2. Just slowly accumulate money with my current job and I can likely pay it off by the start of next summer.

3. Wait till I graduate or get a better job relating to Network Admin/IT. I can indefinitely get a paid internship by next summer.",personalfinance

1) Pursuing a master's degree, but I'm uncomfortable taking on another $50k in debt and being responsible for $500+ in new monthly payments, which would essentially negate any raise I get after completing the degree

2) Getting a PMP certification and transitioning to a government role or another role in the university, which could potentially increase my salary to $60k-$70k

I gave them permission to speak to him on my behalf and they told him the application number did not exist, which is when he told me it was probably a glitch in the system and an error on their part because I had been keeping up to date on my bill. I left the store and decided to call on my own to try and get it sorted after spending three hours there trying to figure it out. Now the Recovery Department keeps redirecting me to the Collections agency saying it's ""out of their hands"" because they have mailed me letters and have sent e-mails with the first accounts balance, but I didn't ask for the account to be written off in the first place and I didn't know that there were multiple accounts open in my name! I log in online and see my bill, and pay it.

I don't open letters when I keep up to date on my bills and half of the Verizon e-mails I get are promotional anyway, so why bother opening them when I can just log on and see my bill? Since my service isn't shut off I assumed everything was good with Verizon. I got them to admit that it was whoever transferred the account over's fault because they didn't transfer over the existing lease...I just don't know why I'm being held accountable for what sounds like a system glitch and when I call Convergent they have no idea what's going on, either. I'm not paying the balance owed on the two phone lines when I never agreed to pay it all at once and agreed on monthly installments. I told Verizon that it was fine if they wanted to add the two leases to my existing bill every month as originally agreed to because they apparently haven't been charging me for them, but now they want the balance paid in full. I can't afford that and my credit certainly can't either, I agreed to a two year lease...this is extremely frustrating for me as a customer who thought they were doing well keeping myself up to date on my bills.

I didn't realize adding a line would cancel my existing lease and I'm fairly sure there is no warning of that in their fine-print for signing a new lease. If someone could provide me some insight on the next steps to take I'd be extremely thankful. ",personalfinance

t3_ch3eft,"18, want to get a mortgage","Bit of background:

UK

Aged 18

Living with mother

Work full time hours in fast food restaurant

Last year around £22,000 before tax

Experian score 971/999

&amp;#x200B;

So I want to move out this year and get my own place.  I'm happy with my job and can see myself doing it for a while and hopefully moving up the ladder.  I don't want to rent as I see it as a waste of money but would much rather buy my own house.  The houses I am typically looking at are around £160,000.  I want to put around about 10% deposit down as I hear it is a good start.  I've been talking to other people in my work and two people would like to move in and rent rooms off me.  One of them said they would be happy to pay £300 a month rent and bills on top, the other hasn't mentioned money yet.  I know that the one friends who said he would rent would be renting for a long time, the other I'm not sure about.  I know that if I I'm sensible enough and do rent to my friends that I can quite easily afford to pay the mortgage and keep the house running without living on a really tight budget.  Even without renting I know I could afford it but it would just be a bit tighter.

The issue I've got is trying to get a mortgage.  I've used a couple of different mortgage calculators and most of them are saying that I would be able to borrow around £110,000.  In the details I haven't said anything about renting rooms to other people.  Where I work another girl has been to a financial adviser and they've estimated she can get a loan up £200,000.  She is on a bit more money than I am (about £1 and hour more) but we do around the same amount of hours each month.  She is also about 9-10 years older than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there things I should be doing right now to help get me a better mortgage?

Is my age that big of a factor?

Should I say that I would be renting two rooms to other people?

Will a bigger deposit help?

Am I aiming too high at a house worth £160,000?

t3_cgy3xn,"Going from salaried to contractor for 1 month before leaving my job, they are trying to pay me a lower wage.","Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

Some history-- I've been working for this company for 2.5 years. I began as a part-time contractor making $24/hr. About 6 months after I was hired as a contractor, I became a salaried employee making 55k/yr. About 6 months after that, I received a raise bringing me to 60k/year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to a lot of terrible situations that I'm not even going to get into fully (involving their not paying me for vacations, working 60 hour weeks with no overtime, and other such offenses), I decided to leave this job. My manager and I agreed that August 2019 would be my last month. However, he recently asked me if I would be interested in staying on for the month of September as a contractor, at 25 hours per week. We didn't discuss it much further than this, and we did not discuss the hourly rate. I stupidly assumed that my hourly rate as a contractor would be the same, or higher than my current rate, due to things like a reduction in hours, receiving no employee benefits, and assuming a higher tax burden as a contractor. Nope. They're trying to reduce my pay to $25/hr as a contractor, just $1 more per hour than I was making when I was hired 2.5 years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I let my manager know that I do not agree with this rate? How do I open this discussion and find out a) why my pay is being reduced and b) how to get a rate that I know I deserve (because I'm already making it). I feel like because they asked me to stay on as a contractor in the same role I currently have to ease the transition, I should not be getting a significant pay cut.

t3_cguzcs,Refinancing parent plus loans? How much to do/how?,"Hi all, some background info here I am 25 with a well paying job for my age, currently no debt so my parents are wanting me to help pay some of the parent plus loans that they took out but we have not gotten to a specific number. Of course they want me to do as much as possible and I want to do the lowest amount.

I have three other siblings that all went to/will go to college, youngest sibling starts this fall. My parents and I never had a conversation around what would be paid by who but I ended up leaving college with about $36,000 of loans in my name. I estimate my total cost of tuition was around $85,000 (out of state) so that leaves about $49,000 in my parents name. Out of my siblings, my cost of tuition is most likely the highest. 

I think my parents’ plan was to pay the vast majority of my school however, during college my dad was laid off for around 10 months which really set back my family’s finances/makes me assume the full amount remains if not more than the original due to deferments. I should note that I broke rule number one of PF and co-signed for my younger sibling’s final year at school last year which was $30,500. 

Pay info/budget:
75,000 salary with an expected bonus of 20% (I do not consider the bonus in any budgeting/forecasting that I do- this will be used for either rapid loan pay down, down payment on home, and some travel fun) 
Last year I received a pretax bonus of $10,000, I used the bonus, tax refund, and my nearly entire savings to pay off my car loan and student loans. 
At this point I have built my savings back up some so $8,000 in savings, $2,000 in a brokerage account that I started to play with, and $34,000 in my 401k - I contribute 12%, my employer contributes an additional 6% dollar for dollar so I “over” contribute 6% past the “free money” if that’s worth considering.

Budget: 
$3,923- Monthly take home pay
$775- My half of rent/parking (live with S/O)
$110- Monthly car insurance/registration 
$2,000- Savings
$200- Investments
Remaining $800 or so- discretionary spending- groceries/ gym membership /clothes /eating out /travel/etc. 

Savings are eventually for a house and at some point a wedding but I’m not seriously researching homes nor am I engaged. 

As mentioned, I’m trying to determine what is a fair amount of additional loans that I should take on and what I can afford. I am fortunate to be in what I consider a solid financial position so I don’t want to mess it up but I also want to help out my parents that have done so much for me. My priority number one will be to get the one I co-signed for refinanced however I really want to do less than the $30,500, my sister will be taking on additional debt too so I will have her refinance a portion of that in her name first before others. My initial thought is that taking on an additional $6,500 will be a bare minimum so I will have paid for at least half my tuition.

What should I be cautious of?

I signed some papers thinking it was part of my free week, and he had emphasized I would not be paying anything until August, and I could cancel anytime...

I went in person and one of the managers assured me because I caught it early, I would not be paying anything regardless of the contract. He told me to send another email citing change of address (I’m only away for the summer) and that it would be fine. 

I was charged on 7/15. I called again and another manager said she would get back to me. She never did, and I had to call again today . She cited I never provided proof of change of address even though I was told not to do that. Now I’m not sure what is going to happen.

t3_cgxg1f,A question about capital gains and 401k.,"I can't seem to wrap this around my head even though it is so simple.

So, in a 401k, your taxes are deferred. When you can start drawing from it, the taxes you are paying are an income tax at that time. So, you don't pay any capital gains tax? Only deferring your income tax? If that's the case, isn't the government missing out a whole other method of taxing you?

But let's say I take a lump sum of cash and put it in a standard brokerage account right now and want to start drawing from it in 5 years...at that point, I will also be paying capital gains tax on what I draw, right? So, in total, if it's not a 401k, I will have paid taxes on the money that I put into it (since it is post-tax income), and I am ALSO going to end up paying a capital gains tax if I decide to withdraw from it a year later.

Is this correct? And if so, is the benefit to the 401k that I defer taxes, and don't have to pay a separate capital gains tax?

In case I am asking this in a confusing way, here is another way it is typed out:

So, with a 401k, you are paying only an income tax when you draw from it when you retire, but with a standard brokerage account, the money you are putting into it was already income-taxed, and you will also end up paying the capital gains tax if you draw from it over a year later?",personalfinance
t3_cgxfxa,Would it be a good idea to pay off my CC debt with my financial aid refund?,"Hello, everyone. I got around $6,000 from FAFSA and only ended up using $1,000 for tuition, as I'm going to community college. What's left of that financial aid money is going to my bank account.

t3_ch06ki,Sort of Complex Question About Rollover of Roth 401(k) into Roth IRA.,"TLDR: I'm rolling over Roth 401(k) into Roth IRA. I'm rolling half of the amount, and keeping the other half as cash to help with some immediate financial need. Tax issues to consider?

&amp;#x200B;

I have changed employment this past month, and it's going to take until at least halfway into August before I see my first pay check. I've sold some collectibles, and I'm digging pretty deep into my savings. But I want to have some cash on hand to solve any immediate liquidity issues. I solved my car issues with selling the collectibles, but I need some more cash to give me some comfortable wiggle room.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a Roth 401(k) with my former employer which I plan on rolling over into my Roth IRA. According to the people (the website actually) who handle my Roth 401(k), close to 98% of the balance I can rollover is considered non-taxable while the remainder is taxable. I'm assuming this 98%, and I've check this, is my contributions. The rest were earnings on my account (pretty piss poor, I know). 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say for the sake of napkin math (fees not included) I have $1,200 dollars. $200 are the taxable (earnings) portion and the rest is $1,000 which equals my contributions. I'm rolling over $600 into my Roth IRA, and I want to keep $600 for myself. According to the IRS and my trustee website, all $200 of the taxable portion and $400 of the nontaxable will go towards my Roth IRA first and $600 I can keep as cash, no taxes. Is this correct? This is what I'm getting from this

My more complicated question is what tax forms should I expect to receive and/or fill out? I'm assuming I'm getting two 1099-R's for the two distributions, but will I need to fill out an additional form that ""supports"" the amount I kept as cash? Thanks for any replies.",personalfinance
t3_ch05i6,Advice for Investing in a retirement home for the relatively near future,"Hi! 
First off I want to thank this community for all the valuable knowledge you spread! Would be grateful for some sage advice :)

I am in the process of buying a new construction home (move in ready by nov) with the idea of moving in when I retire (in 8 years) and renting it out in the meantime

I am currently renting a house with my family near where I work. 

The building group is offering a couple interior/appliance packages. 
There is a 50k difference between the basic and premium package. If I were to do the premium add ons myself it would be from 65-70k

The premium package includes: hardwood flooring, better appliances, fixtures, stone counters and built in closets

The house itself is about 300k/2500sqft which I will buy outright. 

Since I would rent out the property for the next 7 years or so, my questions is this:
Should I get the premium package now (savings of 15-20k) also probably making it easier to rent out or just plan to gut the place and have a fresh upgrade in 8 years time, when I can enjoy the changes when they are new. 

I am also considering the opportunity cost of that money in (conservative) investments. 

What is the financially sound perspective to this situation? Thanks in advance!!!",personalfinance

t3_ch02j5,Accidentally paid the wrong property tax,"&amp;#x200B;

I live in Illinois and I paid what I thought were my property taxes back in June but today I received a notice in the mail that I owe on my taxes. When I checked the confirmation that I saved it shows a property that is also under my name but is being paid off by my brother (I helped him purchase a home). My understanding is that as he pays the mortgage the lender is responsible for the tax payments on that property by setting aside some of the payment. So I essentially paid the taxes for a different home and I wanted to know if this is something that can be resolved. I am able to pay my home taxes but the money I already paid is what I am worried about and I want it back.

I am considering switching over to HSBC just because of the free wire transfer service they offer to Premier account holders.

But I am worried that the free service is not really free and that I would be paying for it in the form of marked up exchange rates.

I must have put at least 8 combined hours, over 7 days, talking to them, between their online chat in India, sweet but utterly incompetent customer service in the Philippines, and numerous branches in the US...all to no avail. 

That info is simply not available. It seems the only way I can get it is after I actually open an account and initiate a wire transfer transaction…which is ridiculous!

I would be forever indebted to you if you could have a look real quick and give me an idea on the exchange rates on the wire transfer page before you finalize the transaction.
According to them, it should be there on a summary which will include a fee (free for Premier accounts) and the exchange rate.

I'm not a huge fan of rebalancing/maintaining my own portfolio, so either the Vanguard target date fund or the robo-advisor I'm with would be preferable.

Currently, it's looking like:

31% US Stocks (VTI)

20% Foreign Stocks (VEA)

11% Emerging Markets (VWO)

10% Real Estate (VNQ) (I'm guessing the dividends from this would help whenever the market's down)

16% Emerging Market Bonds (EMB)

35.9 total international stock

7% total bond market

3% international bonds

Turns out this bill has been unpaid and I just got a mail today saying my account is *scheduled* to be sent to a credit reporting agency, requesting that I pay the debt.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I know, I have had no line of credit open ever, thus, I do not have a credit score. How will this affect my future score though? I'm very frustrated at the prospect of my credit score being negatively impacted because of something I trusted my mother to do. If I call and pay off the debt now, is there a chance that my credit score will be fine or is it that when a debt gets in the hands of a collector, you automatically take the hit??

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate the advice, as I am very very lost.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I guess I didn't clearly mention but this mail was from a debt collection agency. But I am confused about the *scheduled* part, implying they are waiting for the payment before sending it off to a credit reporting agency. I hope I am alright, but I will call and try to find out. I'll post an update in the future.",personalfinance
t3_cgwhi8,"Brother bailed from a shared house loan, how to deal with it?","3.5 years ago, me and my brother decided to buy a property together for our parents. We tried getting a loan together but due to his financials, we didn't get an approved joint loan. We decided that I will take the loan from the bank as I had the required gross income and other pre-requisites. 

The idea was that even though the loan would be on me, we both will pay the monthly mortgage equally. Also to be safe for any future changes in our family situation, my dad came on the property ownership papers as a 50% owner so he can protect my brothers share. My dad even prepared a ""will"" specific to this property stating clearly that his 50% share will go to his other son i.e. my brother. 

All of this was discussed and agreed upon by all parties involved. After about 3.5 years of paying the mortgage and the interest on it, my brother decided that he wanted out from the property for reasons he only knows (I assume he wanted to buy his own, which he recently just did). I tried explaining to him and the family that this is not right as I didn't agree to take the loan all by myself and I also didn't invest in the property assuming that I am buying it for myself e.g. I would have taken a different property as I wouldn't have to consider his financial situation for paying the monthly mortgage. Everyone except me seemed to agree that ""he's just asking for his money back"" and this is for a lot of reasons e.g. bringing peace back in this whole messed up situation in the family and that I should, as a brother, just let it go and pay him his share and move on with things. 

I ended up paying him the total he had payed in the last 3.5 years (without subtracting the interest I paid to the bank) and also paid him compound interest for the last 3.5 years on the share he was paying as he demanded. He told me that ""I should consider the money he paid as a loan from him to pay the mortgage on the property"", which is weird because I didn't need financial help paying that mortgage, I was just sharing it equally because that's what was decided.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I want to understand,

\- Since this was not something I had with my brother on some legal agreement because I trusted my brother, I am aware there is no legal way for me to support that this is not right. I wanted some advice/confirmation on this being morally or even legally a wrong thing to do.

\- I want to know if there was a better way to resolve this instead of doing what I did and apart from selling the property and sharing the proceeds as the property is in use for my parents. It's something they visit during summers  to relax due to harsh weather in our home town.

\- At last, I want to know if there's a clear way to explain this to my parents that what happened was not right both morally and financially. e.g. I ended up paying double interest (one to the bank and one to my brother) and I might have paid more mortgage amount if I knew I am the only one paying it off to ensure I end up paying less in interest.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole situation has been really stressful for me even after it seems resolved to the rest of the family and I have failed to explain to myself and my parents that there's a lot that went wrong here, but I am open to other ideas. Also I am totally aware of the fact that my parents are just looking after the overall interest of the family and doing everything they can to resolve this for both of us.",personalfinance

The cheapest model 3 you can get on their website is roughly just under 40k which is the SR+. Considering the arguable incentives, tax credit and CA rebates, the car stands at mid $30k. 

Ok so here are my numbers: 
My annual income before tax is 70-80k depending on how many patients I see. Net pay is around 5-5.5k per month. 
Have a student loan of $60k, currently paying $700/mth but obviously that’s adjustable. 
Currently driving a leased Prius that’s coming to an end next April. 
My monthly gas is around $70/month. 
Prius payment is $500/mth including insurance.
I also give $400/mth allowance to my mom. 
Other necessities such as food and gym cost round $300/mth.
Have about $4k in my savings (I started working 2 months ago).
Considering that I live 10 mins south of LA, CA, I’m surround by multiple superchargers. The closest one is 3 miles away. 
My commute is 30 miles average around-trip every day.
I’m not married and currently live with my parents. 
I plan to get married in 5 years or so. 
I have no other interests of any kind other than cars hence why I seek justification to buy a Tesla.

t3_cgwe7n,26 y/o 100k in cash,"I need help please. I bought a house with my ex husband after saving every penny once I got my first job when I was 21. It went up in value a lot, and we broke up and sold it and we both made quite a bit. I'm renting now in an area that I don't think I can afford a house, and am thinking of moving again and buying one in a LCOL area. I work remotely so finding a job isn't an issue. I don't have a car which is super annoying but I live in the heart of a city and don't need one. I would really only buy a car because... I can. And it would be nice to drive to camp/adventure/etc. Life would be more fun and convenient. But again, is 15k and another $200/mo or so for insurance/upkeep worth it? I already am putting a large amount in my 401K and my Roth IRA is maxed.

I save about 1-2k a month in cash because of how frugal I am on top of it all (living in a cheaper 1 bedroom, do my own hair/nails/waxing/etc., no car, only buy clothes on sale or free for review type things, don't go out very often and when I do it's to travel). By the end of the year I'll probably have another 10k or so if I stay here.

Since I'm still in a transitional phase, I was thinking of holding onto the money in my regular savings account until I decide where to move and buy a home. I do want a home. I want a dog (or two) and a yard and to not hear my neighbors so close to me. At the same time, to me this is a huge amount of money and I don't know if it's stupid to keep it liquid for potentially a year or two.

t3_cgukp5,Credit monitoring for a child,"I opened savings accounts for my children last week, and part of the process involved us starting one of the account profiles at one branch before realizing we needed to finish it at another branch where I keep their Social Security cards in a lockbox. Everything went fine from there, the accounts are set up, etc., but this week my son got two letters from the first branch saying that his account was declined due to the results of a credit check with Experian.

I'm not too worried about that - I did call and check to see if they ran a hard check, and the guy I talked to said it was obviously a mistake that they ran it at all and it would have been a ""soft"" check, and that it's no big deal as long as everything went through at the other branch. But in discussing the situation with my husband, we also realized that we've been getting mailings from high-end car dealerships recently, addressed to my son. I hadn't looked at them closely enough to see who they'd been addressed to.

Long story short, I want to check into my son's credit and make sure nothing weird is going on - he's 7, he shouldn't have anything on record anywhere to indicate that he would belong on a dealership mailing list or anything else. He is named after an adult uncle, same first and last but different middle, and there's a possibility he has some records mixed up with the uncle.

t3_cgz91z,Refinance mortgage? Only been a year...,"So my wife and I did a standard FHA mortgage loan through UWM for 200k.. I only had enough to cover the 3.5% down payment that was required for the loan, which means we closed at 4.75% interest rate... I wasn't very thrilled with that, but our lending agent told us that he would keep an eye on the market and let me know in the future if he could get us a better rate.  He was recommended to us by our real estate agent (who we know personally), so I trust him pretty well. He called me a few days ago and said that because of our payment history, which we haven't missed a payment for a year, we could refinance and lower our monthly payment and overall interest rate.

Okay, so what is the downside to this? I've looked over the paperwork that he sent over, and there literally doesn't seem to be a negative... we would get a 3.75% interest rate on the new loan, and save about $120 a month on our mortgage payment.  It seems that it would just reset our 30 year timeline, and we would have to pay for the appraisal up front, and maybe a few hundred dollars for closing costs... am I missing something here?

**Context:**

I'm a recent college graduate starting a new job in September 2019. My company offers a 401(k) plan and matches 50% of the first 6% that I contribute.

I've already max'd out my Roth IRA for 2019,  I also have a decent chunk of cash from selling my car, enough to live on for the next few months. I have no debt.

**Question:**

Should I attempt to max out my 401(k) for 2019 before year-end? This would mean contributing almost 100% (less health insurance) of my paychecks in September – December.

As I see it, the major benefit of this would be heavily reducing my taxes for 2019. The major downside would be locking up this money in an account from which I would be penalized for withdrawing. The other option I would have is to just invest the cash now in a brokerage account.

I have been a long time lurker of this sub. It has helped me in many different areas in life I never would have thought I could have had a chance to improve in.

I was able to pay off all of my CC debt in 2 months, I have been saving money by switching up my spending habits for food, paid off both my parents and girlfriend for all the money they let me borrow while searching for a job, I finally was able to open my own emergency fund AND I have been investing in my 401k.

For all of this, I want to say **THANK YOU**

All because of this sub (since school doesn’t teach you the importance of off all of this) I am sitting in a great spot in my life at 23 years old.

That is until I have started to pay off my student debt...

Small rundown of myself:

* **23 years old**
* **Live in Washington State, USA**
* **Income: $55,000 ($48,000 after taxes)**
* **TOTAL COLLEGE DEBT: -$120,000**

When I started college, both of my parents had jobs and my mom makes a decent amount of money while my dad was on the lower end. We had no money for me to go to college, but I was willing to work for it and pay it back myself. When applying for loans, my parents were just over the line of being able to receive any grants which I did not get and while applying for scholarships I was an average student sitting at a 3.5 GPA so I was never chosen for scholarships (Applied from 50-75 scholarships)

Fast forward to today and now my Brother has moved back home (same time I moved out), My Dad quit his job and suffers from depression and social anxiety. I have done everything I could to get him to go back to work as my mom is currently living paycheck to paycheck but they are so deep into this hole idk if there is any going back (*Please don't comment on my family's personal life, as this is just to help with my overall situation)* so now I am completely on my own for paying these back (I am okay with it, but just need help)

I have searched high and low and learned many different ways I can manage this but nothing feels right. I am now reaching out to reddit in search of someone that maybe had the same situation or found a good way to pay these off as soon as possible.  


EDIT: To breakdown my financial situation a little more, here is a small monthly breakdown

* Monthly payments= -$982.87 (including $600 a month for Student Loan Payment)
* Leftover=$2462.00

I have been trying to put in as much as I can into savings and wanting to put $2000 each month into savings and live off of $100 a week with the remaining balance.  


I am very lucky as I am living with my girlfriends dad rent free and will be able to do this for at LEAST a year but can definitely live there longer with small amount of rent as he is all about helping people

My supervisor(s) have noted how valuable they view me. My Store Manager has been on a leave of absence for several months and only recently submitted a letter of resignation. Over the last few months the store has run successfully with me taking the lead, and the effort has been noticed. 

Should I expect to be offered the average salary or less due to my short time with the company? Does my previous experience grant me any leverage? Does the last few months give me room to negotiate?

t3_cgw2cf,Options for financing a home renovation and addition?,"The spouse and I are pretty conservative financially (we are saving generously for retirement, have a large emergency fund, track all our spending each month, etc). We are fairly debt adverse, but we want to renovate and put an addition on our house while our kids are still young so we get the most number of years of use out of it. 

We have saved up a bunch of money to do this, but we aren’t there yet and we’d like to do the work now rather than wait.

What are the options for financing something like this? What are the pros and cons of each approach?

So far I know there is a construction loan to roll into our mortgage, a HELOC, a home equity loan, and I don’t know what else. For our mortgage I shopped around with various brokers to compare rates and fees, so I’m comfortable with that. 

What’s the best loan type to get? What should I look out for? Any other advice? 

*(Please don’t tell me not to do an addition. We bought this house because of the lot and it wasn’t updated like other houses we looked at and therefore was priced accordingly. We have been saving for this and have expected to do this and will be here very long term.)*",personalfinance

So I finished my undergrad this spring debt-free and have started working full time, but I plan on going back to graduate school in the near future (2-3 years). I currently make around 47k a year in my full-time job but should have the ability to save somewhere between 20-30k over the next two years for future school costs. 

I was thinking that I could use my Roth IRA to invest the funds and then withdraw the initial investment when needed for school without any penalty since taxes are already paid. I am 21 now so while I like the idea of saving for retirement, I feel that covering education costs would be more beneficial while allowing any gains on investments to continue to sit in the IRA until retirement. Is this a good plan for grad school savings? This money obviously won’t pay for all of the costs of school but would make a significant contribution. The only other idea I had was to stash it all in my High yield savings account for the time being.

So, is opening a store credit card a good idea? Common sense tells me it’s a horrible idea lol, I’ve forgotten what the brochure said but I think it’s 0% interest for the first 6 months, and then something crazy like 25% APR.

t3_cgvtrr,Pay off CC debt at 0% interest or student loans?,"I currently have ~$11K each in both CC debt and private student loans (federal is another story). I recently transferred my CC debt to various balance transfer cards so that none of it is collecting interest (this is good, right?). Does it make more sense for me at this point to knock out as much student loan debt as possible before the 0% APR ends and just keep getting new balance transfer cards, or should I for some reason knock out the credit cards first? The student loans are at ~7.5%.  

Perhaps the better question is: is there any reason that I shouldn't just keep getting balance transfer cards? I feel like it's a strategy that makes sense but something about it just...feels sketchy? Like continually moving money around isn't a viable strategy, but I'm still slowly paying it down, not putting more on the cards, and not collecting interest. Am I smart or am I the dum? For some reason the credit card debt just scares me more than the student loans even though they're just about the same amounts.

Edit for more info:  
Credit score was ~680 before getting the two BT cards with credit limits of 3500 and 9000. So I'll get a hit for the credit check and average life of accounts but will get a boost with the debt ratio.

I'm currently paying $200 on my private loans per month, and about $180 on CC debt. Have not looked much into refinancing tbh.

APRs will rise to 20% and 18% in 18 and 21 months, respectively. However, the CC I'm transferring FROM has an APR of 14%, so if no BT cards are available after the promo period is up, I can transfer them back to the original card at the lower interest rate. It's not ideal but it's an option.

t3_cgyhta,Auto Refinancing Questions,"Hello everyone!

I have some questions on refinancing my auto loan. I've searched around the sub and found some good info but wanted some opinions on my situation.

About 5 months ago I got into a car accident (it was a hit and run) and the other driver totaled my car. Long story short, my insurance paid off the rest of my loan and I only banked about $800 from the residual. Of course, I wasn't expecting the situation and I didn't have a substantial amount saved up for a good down payment for the new vehicle. 

I commute about 50 miles a day for work, so I did my research and ended up with a 2016 Hyundai Tucson. I paid about $16,900 for the car and it had about 27k miles on it. The Hyundai has been the second car I've financed, first one being the one that was totaled. Like I said, I didn't have any significant money for a down payment on my car, so I received an auto loan with an interest rate of 6.6%. It seemed a little high to me, but I didn't have really too many options at the time. Plus, my credit was a little rough since I bought my first house only 3 months prior to this incident. Also to mention, my previous auto loan wasn't paid off yet when I bought my new car since the insurance company/previous loan company took forever to figure out that whole thing.

Now here I am five months later, trying to find ways to save some money. My car now has about 33k miles on it and KBB has estimated trade in value at about $15k and PP at about 17k. I owe $18.5k on the car, factoring in taxes and stuff like that. My current monthly payment is about $315. My credit has improved and has been sitting around 680 lately (it was around 750 before the house and all the car nonsense &gt;.&lt;)

I received an offer from a local CU to refinance. It seems like a good offer, offering a $250 bonus and rates as low as 4.74% for my loan term length. But I'm not too sure if it would make sense for my situation or honestly how a refinance actually works. The credit union offer says things like, no application fees and no money down options. Do I need to pay anything for a refinance? I'm so confused! Thank you for reading!!",personalfinance

I'm 26, my husband is 26, we're both engineers at a pharmaceutical company.

\-Pre-tax (gross) income is $184,000

\-No rent currently

\-No expenses, just gas, food and student loans ($1000 monthly) (I have 70K in loans, husband has 15K)

\-40,000 in savings, both have approx. 180K in 401

* Citi $5,000
* Discover $8,000
* Norstrom $2,000
* Saks $16,000
* Best Buy $1,500
* Amex $4,000
* Amex Platinum no pre-set limit

I read somewhere high CC's are bad for mortgages because it heavies out your credit. My FICO score is 784, my husband is at about 690 because he has few accounts (only two). Should I close cards?

t3_cgy3sx,SF Bay Area - Try for a house or give up and what to do with the extra savings?,"ETA: Not trying to buy a house right now. Trying to decide if I should save toward a house over the next 10+ years or not, and where to put the money in the meantime.

My SO and I have finally achieved a stable financial footing and are getting married next year. We are not tech people or engineers so we don't have the kinds of income the average person needs to move into the Bay Area, but we were both born here. I've been working on our finances for the past 5 years of our relationship together, following the r/personalfinance How to Handle $$$ guide. At this point all of our finances are combined and I track them together in a budget for us. We have a 6 month emergency fund, max our Roth IRAs, and with the match from our jobs put away an additional 19K each in a combination of 401(a) and 403(b) accounts. My most recent check on a retirement calculator shows that at the rate we're going and with what we already have we should be ok to retire comfortably as long as we stay the course. I paid off all my student loans, and my SO doesn't have any, so all we have left is a dwindling Auto loan at under 4% interest. We live on about 50% of our combined income in a one bedroom apartment that works great for the time being. On top of the aforementioned retirement savings, we are projected to save 20K extra per year at our current rate of spending/saving.

I am really struggling with what to do about that extra 20K. We have access to 457 retirement accounts so plenty of room to save even more for retirement, reducing our tax burden, but locking up the money. We also dream of owning a home some day, but living in the Bay Area makes that seem somewhat impossible. If we start now putting 20K away per year in a taxable investment account it will take 10 years to get to 200K, which might not even be enough for a down payment on something we would want at that point. Additionally, we really want to have kids which will of course put a dent in the savings amount assuming our incomes don't go up (though actually I assume they will but how much and by when is hard to say). If we do have kids, we'll need a bigger place, and the rent change could be enormous compared to our fairly favorable situation now (my co-worker likened it to golden handcuffs, a great deal but no ability to move as everything gets progressively more expensive around you). Basically I don't know what we're going to do, but I want to manage the 20K we're working incredibly hard to save as effectively as possible. Putting it in a taxable account will give me flexibility on how and when we use it, but putting it in our retirement savings accounts would be better tax-wise?

One last note on the house idea is that my parents own a Bay Area home and have talked about leaving it to me when they retire so they can move somewhere else, however it would likely be 15 years before that happens and of course, they might change their mind and decide to sell it instead.",personalfinance

I'd say in total over the year we have currently spent about $2000 on repairs and it's currently with a transmission shop because of slipping. If all goes as I expect, we'll probably be asked to pay another $1500 or so for a replacement. This brings the running total to about $4000. So, here's my question. At what point do you cut your losses and replace a vehicle versus constantly fixing things? I mean I love not having car payments, but if that money I'm saving in car payments is going towards repairs, am I really saving anything? 

If this is the wrong sub I humbly apologize.",personalfinance
t3_cgurgy,What are my options for trying to pay off a hospital debt if they won’t accept anything less than full payment?,"I went to the ER in February, my insurance covered most of the cost, but I’m left with a balance of $800. It’s no big deal, I can pay it off monthly, but the two representatives I’ve spoken to said that they will not accept that. I’m not sure what to do or what is going to happen to that debt. I worked really hard on my credit score, so for them to somehow bomb my credit because they won’t work with me seems a little unfair (yeah I know life isn’t fair). 

I explained to them that I really don’t have $800 just laying around to give them. Since my visit in February I now have Medicaid for pregnant unemployed mothers (that also means if I get a job I could lose the health care coverage, as well as become ineligible for the food stamps I desperately rely on). I tried explaining that to them as well- I am currently unemployed and 7 months pregnant, so the best I can realistically do right now is $10/month for a couple of months, then $100/month once I start working again. They said on both phone calls that they will not accept that, and both times hung up on me without even a second to respond. 

What are my options? How can I prevent this from getting worse? Thanks in advance.",personalfinance
t3_cgxo0n,"I just received 18k, how do I best eliminate my debt?","So as the title says, last week I received a insurance payout which after it was all said and done landed 18k in my account. I have a **LOT OF CREDIT CARD DEBT** from a decade or so of poor decisions. Basically I want to pay off as much as I can, get back on top of things and just start a little fresher. All of the accounts below are in good standing but I do struggle month to month to even make the minimum payment, then just end up maxing out the card again. Probably needless to say as someone with a lot of debt I also have no idea about how to best deal with credit card companies. Some local people I spoke with (not attorneys, just random folks) suggested contacting the credit card company, saying I wanted to pay off the account, but offering less than I owe. Is that even legal or possible? Here's the situation.

Card 1 $1268 (balance) / 35 mo (payment amount)

Card 2 $2307 / 75 mo

Card 4 $2060 / 65 mo

t3_cgwww4,Understanding Retirement Plans and Which Should I Choose?,"I’m currently 23 and just started working about a month ago. I’m still figuring out a bunch of stuff financially, but as things are starting to settle I’ve been trying to start looking more towards long term plans. But honestly, I’m having trouble understanding where I should be focusing. 

Currently, I have a Roth IRA with just shy of $20K that I’ve had since I was 16. On top of that my company has a great contribution program. We’re required to put 5% away, and then they put an additional 10% (so 15% total of my gross income) into a 403(b). I’m slightly confused because I’ve heard mixed things on whether the mandatory 5% is into a 401k or into the same 403b (or even if it’s possible to offer both), but I am positive their 10% goes to the 403b. Either way, on top of that we can contribute whatever we want up to the IRS limits (according to them the 5% were mandated to put also doesn’t count towards the limit) as a regular contribution or a Roth contribution to the 403b. 

So my question is primarily, where should I focus my money? It seems to me like the Roth contributions are better because I can avoid taxes on my gains by paying them in my income instead now, but presumably it’s not quite that simple. And if I should focus on the Roth’s is it better to use the 403b from my company or the IRA? I will almost definitely be able to max the IRA, but I highly doubt I’ll hit the $19,000 limit for the 403b if that matters. I’m also not 100% clear on all the details, so if more information would help I can do my best to provide it or clarify some things.",personalfinance

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to pull the trigger. Here are some stats related to my situation:

1. Repaid all of my student loans and have $0 in consumer debt ($0 in student loans, $0 in CCs)
2. Bought a home in August 2018 and have a mortgage \~$370,000 balance on it. I recently moved out because I wanted to try the landlord game. I am currently renting this property and earning $500/month in cash flow. I don't use this money it just goes into a savings account. Interest rate of 4.375%
3. Max out my 401(k) at 18% and maxed out my Roth IRA last 5 years. This year is maxed. ($200,000 in 401(k) and $47,000 in Roth IRA)
4. I bought my second property in June 2019. I have a $216,000 mortgage on it. I live here and payments are low (\~$1,300/month). Interest rate of 3.875%
5. Received a decent windfall of $170,000 two months ago. I have a high yield savings account with \~$200,000 in it.
6. Investing \~$1,000 per month in after-tax accounts. After-tax investment accounts total $55,000 all together.
7. Currently make $160,000-$200,000 per year in income from my day job.

Question for you. How do I put some of this $170,000 windfall to work? It feels criminal to have $200,000 in my high yield savings account.

I've debating buying more rental properties in real estate, but even since renting out my first property I've had a couple of headaches pop up, which will happen.

Secondly, I'm at a bit of a crossroads with my career. Some days I sit and say I'd love to pay off my mortgage at my primary property and make money from my investment property. I'd be able to quit my job and work a freelancer or consulting lifestyle on my own terms.

t3_cgwg1i,Calculating mortgage payoff date/interest with variable rate?,"This is more of a curiosity question than anything really important. Currently I'm using an app called ""Payoff Track"" to keep track of my mortgage payments. You input the loan amount, interest rate, term, payments per year, and start date. It calculates scheduled interest and regular payment. If you input extra principle payments it then keeps track of how much extra you've payed, your new expected payoff date, and the reduced expected total interest paid. It's a spiffy little app.

Our mortgage is somewhat atypical as it is a 15/15 ARM. That is, halfway through the 30 year term it will readjust the rate through the magical interest rate formulas, and keep that rate for the second half of the loan. This makes me a bit nervous since our current rate is a near rock bottom 3.25% and who knows what it could be in 12 years when we hit the 15 mark, but in all likelihood it would be higher, considering how low it is now. Because of that, despite the conventional wisdom of dealing with a low interest mortgage, I've been starting to put extra towards principle every month. I doubt it will be possible to have the whole thing paid off before the 15 years, but it will surely lessen the impact should the rate skyrocket (12.25% I believe is the cap) .

That brings me to my question at hand. I am just wondering how I would go about calculating the new payoff date etc. once that 15 year mark hits. I am assuming, but haven't confirmed, that just changing to a new interest rate in the app would apply that interest rate to all its past calculations and throw everything off. My guess is the best way to figure it out is to just get rid of that loan in the app and put in a new one - 15 year mortgage, for whatever the current balance is at that time, at the new rate. This seems like it would make sense since, from my understanding, with an ARM, when the rate adjusts, the minimum payment is adjusted in a way that keeps the final payoff date (30 years from start) the same, regardless of whether you were ahead before the adjustment or not. So for these calculations, I am essentially starting over with a 15 year loan on the balance. Am I thinking correctly?

Again, considering we are only 3 years into this loan, it's not much more than a hypothetical question at this point, but it's something I was wondering about.

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback, it is useful, but I really was just looking for clarification on how I would treat the calculations after the 15 years (my last paragraph), assuming that we have not paid off or refinanced the loan yet. Thanks :-)",personalfinance

t3_cgwe7u,Will be moving away in 9 months - Should I still be paying off debt after 1k emergency fund?,"I am 26, married, but recently went back to school. My decision was largely because my body is absolutely killing me from going on 8 years working in warehouse environments.  I am going back to school to be a vet. Believe me, I’ve read all about how vet school is a bad investment, as well as high stress for not much pay. I get it. I want to help animals. I want to help people who help animals. I want to be around animals.  I’m pretty committed at this point. 

I’ve been out of school for about a decade now, and as such I had to enroll in a local CC near me with completely online classes. It’s actually great, because they work closely with the institution in which I hope to be enrolled, so all of my classes will transfer with no issues. The problem is that they run out of classes that will apply to my undergrad degree in Animal Sciences at my future university after the spring semester. This means we will be moving 5 hours north to that school after Spring 2020. The great thing is my wife can work remote and keep her full time job. One guaranteed income is better than none. Being in school, I am hoping to pick up 20-30 hours or so at a vet clinic to help us get by. I can’t tell you how much I am leaning on my wife right here, and how much I appreciate what she is doing.

t3_cgwd68,Balancing 401k contributions and saving for home purchase?,"Hello everyone, 

I have some concerns about 401k contributions and home ownership. I’m 25M in North NJ, been working for 3 years and have $25k in Chase account, and $70k across 2 CDs at 3.2%. No debt.   

My income increased to $67,080 this year. My net pay is about $1,400 biweekly, (I contribute $700 into 401k and get about $100 employer match biweekly). My contribution percentage is 28% and right now 401k is at about $22k.

I live with my parents (and before anyone says I’m leeching, I’m not, they’re happy to have me and I do help out with housekeeping tasks like cleaning, laundry, mowing grass).

Well, I’ll get right to it I guess, I want to buy a home in the next 5-10 years, probably 5-10 acres of waterfront property, surrounded by forest and mountains in the background, in upstate NY for purposes of homesteading. It’s a dream of mine for retirement, living in nature, gardening, keeping animals, fishing and just enjoying life and nature. But since I’m still relatively young, I’ll probably purchase the property and have my parents live there for a while or use it as a vacation home. They can retire there (if they decide so) and my brother and I will live at the current house (which is a 10 minute walk to the workplace for me). 

I don’t have any plans of switching jobs or moving to another area, I enjoy my job very much and plan to stay here for at least the next 5+ years. They have invested a lot of money in me by paying for my Master’s degree and overall they are great people. 

Based on my projections and saving rate, I expect to have $250k saved up by 2025, plus the additional $70k from the CD accounts, totaling $320k. (That is, if I continue to live with parents until I'm 30). Some might view this as a drastic action to save money and might say that I’m missing out on freedom, independence, and self-sufficiency. Could be the case, but with having money saved up, there is comfort in knowing I don’t have to worry and can buy anything I might want or need (within reason of course). 

Anyways, I’m looking for homes that are ideally less than $550k, so by 2025 I want to save as much as possible so that the loan that I take from the bank is minimized. I want to be able to put a 40%+ downpayment in order to pay everything down quickly and not pay large interest.

They wouldn't let him cancel it over the phone even after he had explained what the situation was, and you can't cancel it through the app or online. As a solution, I just had him take all of the money out of that account and put it in a different one.

13 months ago, I got in a boating incident where I was undocking at the state park and had to push off another boat so I wouldn't hit him. Pushing off the boat caused his boat to rock and caused some damages to his boat cuz he hit the dock. We exchanged address, name, and phone#. There wasn't a police report. He told me he'll file it under his home insurance and that I'll pay for his deductible. He got a quote on the damages and showed me a copy and told me to only pay for his insurance deductable. I sent him a money order and thought that was the end of it.

6 months later, his insurance called me every couple of months to follow up on the incident. It kept on going to voicemail. I never answered the phone. 

About 2 weeks ago, I received a call from subrogations who left a voicemail to call them about the incident. Then a week ago, I got a letter in the mail from the subrogation stating that the insurance company believes they are entitled to some or all of the money for the repair damage. And it says I can pay the subrogation or claim it on my insurance.

Please let me know my options or advice on what I should do. I don't think I should be paying anything since there wasn't any police file of the incident. Plus I already paid for the guys insurance deductible.

The part that catches me up is about diversifying between taxable and non-taxed accounts—*I've read that taxable accounts should not contain bonds.* But say I wanted to create a 90/10 split between stocks and bonds, and I want to spend enough in a taxable account to mean my 401k becomes very bond-heavy.

I am still not under contract even if I accept the terms, but have pretty meh incentives to stay for at least a year.

Another firm (not a direct competitor) has made me an attractive offer, but the person I'd be reporting to seems difficult and the work load appears daunting, plus there would be more travel.  On the plus side, the offer pays 10% more and has really good incentive comp potential, which is a no go currently from the buying firm.  All things being equal, I'd rather stay at my current firm, but...everything isn't equal 

Options:

1.  Accept the offer, collect $15k, bolt immediately for new firm.  Is this unethical or is this just par for the course?

2.  Bring new offer to attention of acquirer/seller and give them a chance to match.  Try to squeeze out extra $$$.  Stay with firm and try to make it work.

&amp;#x200B;

Current rent is \~22% of our combined current pay, but will be going down to \~15% after the salary increases. New rent would be \~22% after our raises, so proportionally not much different than what we're paying currently. The move would reduce my commute from 30 minutes each way to a 3 minute walk and my girlfriends commute from 45 minutes each way to 30 minutes or less. That's 4.5 hours a week for me and &gt; 3 hours a week for her. Using our post-tax hourly income, the calculated time savings would more than make up for the rent difference.

&amp;#x200B;

We do have student loans in the tens of thousands, and we would have to terminate our lease early (1 month's rent and lose security deposit), but we think the time savings would more than make up for that. Also, we think we'd be happier with the amenities provided (pool, nice backyard, near bike trails). We'll be saving at least 30% of our income either way, probably toward our loans or IRAs. We have an emergency fund of three months of expenses.

Edit: We are currently a 1-car household. I thought about staying where I am and getting a second car for a 15 minute commute, but the math (insurance + parking + car cost/loan if needed + gas + maintenance) makes it not much different than the rent increase.

I  wasn't taught ""how to"" financially, I was told what to do, and didn't  learn or know options either. It was good advice and control that worked, but not the best teaching.

I  will be returning to self employment (2k capital investment to reboot  it, already saved in separate account) once things settle down back  where I came from, but it will take a year or so to turn profit and do much more than cover itself and health insurance. It solidly earns 1k and change per month profit, after costs, accountant, taxes and health insurance once it's established. I book far ahead, but it's the most I can do. It's the only skill I have that I can do with my disabilities, but it's reliable income and needs are met. Extra money goes into keeping a stable emergency fund and/or retirement each month, and only comes from earned income. My savings went down from the moving costs, but back up from saving on rent. I live cheap and basic.  


Had  been renting a house my entire adult life, rented from the advisor that  died, so no references. It was a deal, and I took great care of  it right back, it felt like home my whole adult life. Moved in here in March, after the  family cleared out of all their stuff. Everything was good, but then the  pollen hit, hard. Didn't have this climate or allergies back home, meds  aren't working enough. Friends and family are missed bad, I'm lonely  here. Must go, going back to where I came from. Where I came from is a  big popular city that's had a freaky runaway sellers market, and housing  costs (rent or buy) are about double there (seattle urban). Places I'd like to buy and  make home forever is 330-360k range there, all ancillary buy/move costs around  that would be additional too. I don't even know what they all are!  Closing, inspection, moving, taxes, insurance, repairs ??  


How  do I best invest in my future ahead? Sell? Rent out here (it would take a management co too) and buy there, but finance it and use rental as  collateral? Should I sell and just spend the proceeds on renting again and not take any risk?  


I  don't know how to borrow, or own, or buy. And I want to stay out of  debt except for house payments, that seems a smart exception. Rent proceeds from the inherited home would only  cover it's overhead and being well maintained. I wouldn't plan to see  any money from it until quite a bit of money could be saved up for it's  expected and unexpected needs, it could be years, and rely on steady renters too. Appliance replacements  as needed, other repairs, preventative maintenance, and a management company.. Would renting it out even cover all that?   


Having  security and being an owner feels good, can I move, and not be an idiot?  Security is what the inheritance was meant to give, I want to honor that not squander it. The will said do whatever I want with it, it didn't advise. I'm good at budgeting and living within my means if  I'm taught and prepared, and making a big enough savings to cover  surprises too and keep my budget stable. I'm scared to bite off more  than I can financially chew, maintain and protect. It's all too foreign.

t3_cgvmtf,Helping mother (56) plan for retirement,"First time poster here, so appreciate any and all advice. I'm a 26M CPA and consider myself well read on personal finance matters. I went to school double majoring in Accounting &amp; Finance and try and offer financial advice to my family when and where I can. Which leads me to my mom's current situation:

Background: 
My mom (56) wants to retire when she turns 60 (Summer of 2023) She has spent the past 27 years in the education industry buying into the ILTRS (Illinois Teachers' Retirement System) which essentially works as a pension. Every year of service credit is multiplied by 2.20% of the average of the 4 highest consecutive salaried years of the last 10 years (not confusing or anything). For example, a $100,000 average annual salary with 30 years of teaching credit would equate to a retirement pension of $66k/annually ($100,000 x 30 x 2.2% = $66,000.00).
Roughly 25 years ago, my mom withdrew 6 years of service credit from her account to cover medical expenses; Unaware that the roughly $2,000 withdrawal would accrue 6% interest over the course of time. Fast forward to today, and that $2,000 withdrawal has now ballooned to  ~$30k with $175/mo of accruing interest. My mother has the option of buying back these service years, however it is an ""all-or-nothing"" policy. Given the above example, those extra 6 service years amount to $13,200 of additional annual income (no brainer in the long-run). The question is, how does she fund the buy-back?

My mother does not have a lot of liquid assets but has a few options:
(1) Pending workers compensation claim - expects to receive anywhere from $10k - 50k from a pending WC claim. Could be anywhere from 6 mos. - 3 years from now.
(2) Traditional IRA - Has roughly $10k saved in a traditional IRA which given the annual pension doesn't do a whole lot for her.
(3) Loan consolidation - Has a solid credit score (750) which may qualify her for a loan at &lt;6%. Have not researched this option in great detail.

Questions:
(1) Would it be wise to take the 10% hit on the pre-59.5 IRA withdrawal now (as well as adding $10k to her ordinary income) in order to pay a sizeable chunk and limit the accrued interest exposure?
(2) Should she hold out and wait for the legal settlement and then apply all of that at once?  
(3) Continue to make monthly payments (can afford a monthly payment of ~$300-400) to try and slow down accruing interest while waiting on WC settlement?",personalfinance
t3_cgvlpm,Per Diem tax questions,"Looking for some guidance here.   Employer pays me a flat rate each week for food,gas and car (lets say 600 week).

I drive about 300 miles to work on Sunday nights, and go back home Thursday afternoon (my car)

My employer pays my hotel directly so no expense/billing on my part.

This gets paid out without taxes on my weekly paycheck.  I do not submit any expense reports (for food, gas, etc).  My accountant says that this weekly payment will be taxed when I file my taxes with him.   I thought that ""per diem"" is not taxable.   I love not having to submit expense reports and keeping receipts, but if I am going to pay taxes on this per diem, then I am only getting like 75% of the payment (assuming a 25% tax rate).

t3_cgvjya,When to contribute to Roth IRA?,"I was wondering how much it matters when I contribute to my (and my wife's) Roth IRA? For background, she is self employed with variable income (although we are just past her major slow period for the year) and our expenses vary. I have a general budget that instead of setting aside money for specific expenses (like travel or car repairs), lumps it in all together (although we do have a separate savings account, which we also put money into - this is ideally going towards a baby). I contribute to my 401K with each paycheck, but the last 2 years I have done a Roth IRA contribution at the end of the year. I am worried about contributing too early since her income is variable and, for example, this year I've had no major car repairs (old car/high mileage) and I know we'll be buying plane tickets (\~$800) sometime in the next few months. We are up about $6700 for the year (in terms of income not otherwise allocated), so I could go ahead and contribute to one, but I worry about not having that money liquid (we do have a 6 month emergency fund).

t3_cgvj7e,How can I most effectively build my credit?," 

Today I was notified that a large debt of about 5k spread across 5   ""accounts"" (same creditor) just came off my Experian credit report (I   disputed right after I paid it off), and that means that I am debt free!    TU dispute is still in progress, and they are not in my Equifax  report  for some reason.

My Experian account thing says I have a score of around 602.

My   next step is to get a secured credit card through Discover (I was able   to get a secured card through OpenSky about a year ago, and I don't  want  to test the unsecured market quite yet), or should I wait a little  bit?   If I do nothing will my credit score gradually increase?  (it  jumped  14 points upon resolution of the dispute).

I pay HOA dues each month, and I opt in to credit reporting for that, though I doubt if that matters.

I   don't have a mortgage, and probably will not need one (I own a condo   through a trust), but I would like to option of getting an auto loan in   case my truck dies for some reason.

Basically is my next move to build my credit back up, or should I just chill out for a little bit?",personalfinance
t3_cgvj48,Is this a scam? Wells fargo debt collection (NCS Recovery Services),"* Got a call stating I was being served documents tomorrow between 3pm and 5pm regarding a civil case by wells fargo bank to collect on an old account that I owe $500 on.

* I called wells fargo legal and debt collections departments and they have no record or any collections or outsourced collections.
* the debt collector cant send me any information about the debt

Right now, I have \~4k in a roth IRA with Thrift Savings plan (that I cannot contribute to anymore), $255 dollars in a roth IRA with Fidelity that I put as much as I can monthly (usually around 100-150, sometimes more if its a good month), I have an Acorns account with roundups (I also throw about 50 bucks a month in there) and a brokerage account with fidelity and TD Ameritrade, that each has $100 in at the moment.

My expenses are as follows:

Rent: $1,019

Car: $340

Insurance: $202 (I have 2 vehicles, one I own outright and one I have a loan on--I'm also married and my wife works)

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance has $4k in a previous summer employment 401k funds that were forced out of that employer's plan due to no longer working there and moved to a 'Custodial IRA', which is designed as a holding account.  They are sitting as bonds and doing nothing to appreciate or grow...grr!  


For that reason, changes cannot be made to the account (such as allocating to index fund investing), other than moving the funds out and into her own IRA or another employer sponsored retirement plan.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 1) she could move this to her Vanguard Roth IRA as a conversion of pre-tax dollars to Roth.  She would have to report the $4k funds as income, and claim it as income.

&amp;#x200B;

OR 2) She could open a Traditional IRA &amp; then there are no taxes at all.

&amp;#x200B;

OR 3) See if her school current employer allows her to roll it into her 403-B retirement plan.

&amp;#x200B;

She is a teacher in Illinois making $60k a year, will probably maintain this salary amount for the foreseeable future.   

  
What is the best advice here?  My understanding is that if she were to have both a Roth and a Traditional, she could only do 6k between the two total in the contribution year.  But is the best investment strategy or?  I don't want her to have to take this out and pay a lot on taxes to a Roth, etc. but I think she wants it in her Roth for 'simplicity' sake of that one account...but she would think twice if she knew other scenarios.  For some reason we are sidelining the 403-B account as a secondary option just to contribute to IRA more, her 403-B is not matched by employer (she does contribute a healthy amount now each paycheck), but if it makes sense to put it there..?

Any help would be amazing...thanks, all.",personalfinance

This may be highly specific, but I've seen some hints of knowledge on the topic after a quick forum search. It's got me in analysis paralysis and is preventing me from opening a retirement account, so would appreciate any help.  


I'm a self-employed expat living abroad in Poland. I don't pay taxes in this country because I'm living here on a tourist visa (it's infinitely extendable for Americans), so I file my US taxes every year only. I exclude all of my income using the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, so I don't pay any Income Tax. I do, however, still pay Self-Employment tax, which amounts to around 15% on my income.  


Now, I know you're not allowed to contribute to an IRA nor \[arguably\] a Roth 401K with income that is excluded using the FEIE since there'd be douple-dipped tax benefits, but if I still pay Self-Employment tax, does that mean it's still taxable income and I can contribute with it?

My question is: Should I split that money amongst the three cards that I owe debt on each month or hit one card with $800-$1000 instead of ($300 on each)? 

I’m trying to navigate what would be the best approach. It feels silly to only pay the minimum on the other cards while hitting one “hard,” although I could be completely wrong.

t3_cguqce,Options for paying down significant credit card for one income family,"We are a family of four with one income that is $62k a year. We have one credit card with a $17k balance, 9% interest rate and payment is about $320 a month. We have a car loan at 3.99% interest and $14k balance with a payment of $277 a month.

We had a rough year with a tree falling on our house and cars last summer, and our septic system failing the next month. We ended up using our savings account, about 3k, to cover the additional cost of replacing the back half of our roof (insurance was only covering front half) and one window on the front of the house (insurance covered other windows damaged but one was left over) to match. 

After our septic system was deemed failed, we had to get an additional loan for $4k to cover the cost of the new septic design and tree removal from over where the new system would need to go. This system would cost $20k but we were able to get a grant for $13k and the remainder financed at a low cost, costing $75 a month (which is exactly what we've been paying to rent a porta potty while we waited for the new system.)

We are able to pay all of our monthly bills with a little left over but with 2 kids and a home, there is ALWAYS something coming up.

We are considering a balance transfer for our credit card, with maintaining the current payment of $320 a month to at least make a dent in our credit card balance and additionally adding what we can from tax returns to it. The concern here is, the effect on my husbands credit for applying for a new card, which I would think would be negated by the positive effect of lowering the balance.

The other option is a home equity loan, we could probably have about $40-$50k in equity, not sure of the exact amount, it was originally valued at 120k but we've got new windows on front, new roof, new siding on the front, new porch on front and a brand new aerobic septic system, so I think the value has likely gone up.

The last option is to just keep on what we're doing, but barely making any progress on the credit card. I will return to work in Sept 2020 when our youngest goes to kindergarten.

My score was 823 and I figured I'd have no issue. Instead of immediate approval I was told it was being ""held for review."" The next business day I was contacted by Barclay where the credit review folk approved me but said some other department wanted ""more documentation"" and I got forwarded. This next person asked me for paper bank statements and utility bills with my home address on them, _to be mailed in_, before they would approve the line of credit. I've owned and lived in my home some 16 years now, which is clearly on my report, so I have no idea why they'd ask for this. I've had paperless statements for years, she said forwarding an email or printout wouldn't be enough as it needed to be on the bank/utility's official paper.

I told them forget it, cancel the application. I will simply pay for the new computer in full and spare myself the hassle.

Is there any way to get this ""hard pull"" removed from my account? I feel cheated by Barclay's for wasting my time. I have no idea why they even pulled this stunt.",personalfinance

t3_cgrlju,Off-Scheduled Escrow Statement Letter Received,"This happened a few months ago and at the time I was unable to pay the difference in order to keep my monthly mortgage payments down and had to go with ""Option 1"" as described in the letter.

    Because your escrow account is projected to have less money than is needed, there is a shortage of $1,141.31.
    
    Option 1) Do Nothing: The monthly shortage for the next 12 months is $95.11 and will automatically be added to your monthly payment beginning June 2019. Your new monthly payment for June 2019 will be $4,855.63.
    
    Option 2) Pay the escrow shortage as a lump sum using the attached shortage coupon. If you pay your escrow shortage by May 20, 2019, then your new monthly payment will be $4,760.52 effective with your June 2019 mortgage payment.

t3_cgu1tf,Paying off Rent with CC or Bank Acct?,"So I got a credit card and its not the greatest credit card of all time or anything but basically I get 1.25% Cash back on everything and if i spend my rewards on paying my student loans I get an additional 25% added. I figure hey use the CC for pretty much everything and get the points, pay my balance off each month and have an extra 25$ or so going towards a loan that I would otherwise not have. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking about paying my rent with the card to get the points because it would get my a bunch more reward cash back as opposed to just paying it out of my bank account. I have to pay an additional 21$ for a CC payment though. So I would get about 11 Dollars in cash back on that one payment plus the 25% bonus which would bring it to about 13.70. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I basically lose like 7 bucks when its all said and done not exactly the end of the world, but are there any potential issues I would face regarding my credit score (about 775) by paying a larger sum like my rent on my card?

t3_cgu08s,Asurion insurance through Verizon broke my phone and I cannot recover any of my data. They refuse to help and then fined me....,"I had a small crack on my iPhone 10X Max phone screen and I opted to file an insurance claim to replace the screen. For $30, someone would come to my home and replace the screen there. Sounds good to me! 
The guy shows up and disassembles my phone. After the new screen goes in, he calls me in the room with the disappointing news that the new screen was faulty and none of the touch functions are working. He hands me a card and says to call this number, and leaves. I quickly realize that my previously working phone cannot be accessed or backed up because I cannot enter my password. 
Asurion overnights me a refurbished phone, and to my shock, my iCloud had not been backing up my data for months! I now cannot recover a ton of things like photos of the day I got my first puppy, and the recording of the last words I spoke with my grandpa and TONS of other sentimental items. 
I called Asurion to demand that they come and replace the screen again so I can back up my data before returning the phone. After TWO HOURS getting passed around, the final person flat out refused to help claiming “I should have had my data backed up.” At no time was I ever worried there would be a problem because I used to do screen replacements myself several years ago, and no one warned me of a risk. While trying to figure out how to get my data, Asurion bills me $1000 for the phone because it was not returned on time. 
Any advice on how to handle this? I HAVE to get the data trapped in that phone out, but it will likely be $500 to replace the screen at a repair shop, only to send the phone back to Asurion right after... I feel so mistreated and at a loss. Has anyone had this problem before?? Any advice would be much appreciated!!",personalfinance

t3_cgtnzy,How should I track down my deceased parents' unclaimed stock?,"If this isn't the right sub for this, I apologize. Please let me know the best place to post.

I'm in Alabama, USA. My parents lived in Tennessee. I have a brother in Tennessee. 

My parents passed away about 2 years ago. I was contacted today by a company named Keane, claiming that there are unclaimed stocks in my parents' name, and Keane will help me claim them. I did not agree to anything other than saying they could mail me information. I was at work, so the best that I could glean is:

* Mail to my parents' address has been returned, triggering a legal requirement to list the stock as abandoned (unclaimed?). It was implied that Keane was contracted to contact me, but that sounds fishy.
* Keane will not say which stock is unclaimed until I agree to have them do the work, including paying their fees if money is claimed.
* Mail has been sent to my brother (I am waiting to hear back from him to see if he's gotten it). 

My main question is, what's the best way to figure out if any of my parents' stock is really unclaimed/abandoned? A quick search turned up [this page](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/MadeInAmerica/unclaimed-money-stocks-tracking-shares-lost-track/story?id=15355832).

t3_cgtf8x,401(k) Early Withdrawal for Other Investment,"So, as the title reads, I am hoping to clear out my vested balance in my 401(k) to move it into a different investment that is obviously unavailable through the 401(k) provider, and I just had a few questions on how this process works.

Firstly, and I don't mean for this to come off as rude or anything, but please hold any advice about not doing this. I've only had the 401(k) for a little over a year, so the balance isn't huge to start with, and beyond that, I believe my return potential to be substantially greater in the other investment. Plus, I'm only 26, so there's plenty of time to try to adjust and recoup going forward, and I believe now is probably the only time in my life where I'm in a position to gamble on a higher-risk/higher-return investment (i.e. no kids, mortgage etc.)

With that said, I just wanted some clarification on how the penalty and taxes are assessed and paid. From what I've seen, it looks like a flat 10% penalty, and then an additional ""penalty"" in the sense that the distribution is then considered taxable income, and I would then be required to pay the income taxes on it.

My main question is how and when this is paid. I'm assuming the taxes are just paid when I file next April, and I would just mark the distribution sum as ""other income"" or something to that extent, correct? Then, is the penalty just deducted when I receive the distribution, or do I have to settle that up elsewhere?

I graduated in 14' with my bachelors and ~76k in debt. I moved back home and found work relatively quickly. I am happy with what I do; I think it is one of very few occupations that could make me feel fulfilled. But the current location is such a drain. Ive wanted to leave for a while, but not until I felt financial stable/free. FF to almost 5 yrs, to today: I have about 6k left and plan to finish paying by Nov.

Location: NYC:

- 6k left in student loans. ~87/month min, but Ive been paying 1200-2000/month on avg. 
- 5k left in hospital bills. ~100/month. I pay 112
- 400 in cc debt. (Edit)
- 56k/yr,  but can change to 55-73 at different location, same title. 
- 5k emergency. Checking, savings, and new investment account. (Used 2-2.5k savings few months ago to snowball loans) May open up a real estate account, once I am more liquid, for buying a house or w.e.
- $440/mo on transportation.
- $300-700 to parent here and there for rent/food, but not obligated.
- I dont have to be, but am paycheck to paycheck because I throw everything possible at Sallie Mae to meet the end of year goal. Pay weekly and am usually left with $40-150 in checking til the next week.
- Generally ~750-802 credit score 
.

Tentative 10yr plans:

- I have a 401. I still have to look into it, but when Im done with loans: Rearrange allocation, increase 401 percentage payment, and sign up for roth ira maybe.
- After loans, save max to recoup savings for 3-6months, before looking into getting a car. (I partly feel stuck because I cant just get up and move to another state easily.)
- Continue researching about stocks. Buy first stocks at the end of the year. Ive been reading quite a few investing and accounting books.    
- Once side projects are finished, look into/create a business model. I want to start selling the various things I make. 
- Move out and find roommates or buy my condo. Either live there and rent out a room or rent out and move away. Lots to research here. 
- Most likely in another big city soon, east or west coast or maybe a diff country. 
- Im gonna have to help my mom throughout retirement most likely, which will start soon. 
- My non occupational dream is to make enough money to build/decorate/renovate my own house with a decent backyard, not super close to another house and travel. Im not flashy, I dont need a whole lot.

my mom and dad married in 1990. both immigrants. lived in the states ever since. My dad owned a restaurant business (dad already lived in the states since 1988ish), and my mom worked there as well. they divorced 2001

my mom moved out of that state and has lived out of state ever since. Now, for future purposes, (i.e. social security in the future. as well as proof that she was working in the USA/living in the USA long before 2000) she needs these tax records.

However, I cant find them online. I am going through SS admins, and the IRS building phone numbers. Before all this, i applied through the online tax transcript for her. yet the system says there are no match for her? which makes absolutely no sense.

how can i get these past records?

t3_cgslbt,Trying to buy a home but not sure what to do,"My girlfriend and I have been looking for a home for the last 6 months or so and are a little frustrated with the market currently. We have found countless homes only to be told by our realtor that they have already accepted an offer, some within hours of listing. We have been to 30+ showings only to be disappointed by the actual vs the photos. We are getting tired of looking because we can't seem to find a place that checks all our needed boxes without sacrificing too many of our wants. We feel like we are doing well enough that we shouldn't have to settle too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial information:**

We live in New England for reference of housing costs. We are both 24 years old with a combined gross income of \~ 85-90k depending on my overtime. We have a total of about 65k saved up in an online savings account that will only increase the longer we look for a home (we save about 700 a week combined). We both own our cars with little to no debt at all and live at home with our parents. I live rent free while she has to pay about 500 a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Housing information:**

Our initial budget was 230k but once we actually dove into the home buying process we increased it to 270k with a \~3.8% interest rate. We plan on putting about 10% down to keep a decent chunk left for furniture, emergency savings and potential car purchases. We wanted something big enough to grow a family in but not too big that we wouldn't utilize the space now (3 beds). We also want something structurally move in ready, meaning we don't mind changing out cosmetic things (floors, cabinets, paint. We basically don't want to knock down walls and change the layouts or structure. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Our options:**

So currently we have a few options in mind. We can either keep aggressively looking and hopefully find something that meets our needs and some, if not most of our wants, or we could wait until the spring and keep saving up money. By my calculations we would have approximately 90k saved up if we waited until the spring (April). If we do go that route our budget would increase to possibly 300k with the extra money we could put down (20%) and avoid PMI. If we do wait until the spring we will casually look around, but we wont be spending 8 hours a day looking like we do now. More like a quick check every afternoon to make sure nothing slips by.  

&amp;#x200B;

**A few questions:**

Is our budget too low? Is it too high? How much should we really put down? Do we have enough saved up? Is renting a better option?

t3_chpzag,$102k in credit card/consumer debt after dealing with depression/family emergency/living above our means. Temporarily stop 401(k) contributions to pay aggressively pay down debt?,"Hi all,

So yeah, we've learned our lesson the hard way and the guilt I feel is immense.  This has been a huge eye opener for us, and my fiance and I sat down and looked at our finances a few weeks ago and were wondering how in the hell we got here.  We determined we were living above our means, and have since made some adjustments to cut back after working out some mental health issues that were really causing me issues. We moved to a cheaper apartment, sold one of our vehicles, and overall and trying to be more conscious of where our money is going.

Now, we're wondering if it makes sense to temporarily stop our 401(k) contributions to aggressively tackle this debt.  We'd be losing out on our employer match, but I think given the interest we're paying on some of these cards/loan, and just the ability to pay these down faster and have the peace of mind, it may be worth it.. plus I'm sick if paying these minimums.

Below are some stats

Ages: 27, 29

Combined annual income: \~178k base (with about an additional $10k in year-end bonuses).

Monthly net income (assuming no 401(k) contribution, but still includes our health insurance): \~$9,690

Living expenses:

Rent: $1590 (recently moved to a cheaper place, down from $2700.. we're in a very HCOL area)

Utilities: \~$175 (internet, gas, electricity, trash, etc)

Subscriptions: \~$65 (netflix, spotify, game subscriptions)

&amp;#x200B;

Now for our debts:

Total credit card minimum payments: \~$1,700 (total C.C. amount \~$72k)

Payoff loan: \~$1,194  (total loan remaining \~$30k)

Disneyland passes (can't cancel these against Disney policy, unfortunately, and have ab out 6 more months on them): \~$207

Tesla loan: $783 @ 3% (We were previously driving nearly 65 miles a day, the gas savings alone made this move make sense.  We were saving \~$350 a month in gas). We still car pool to work everyday. We owe $48,400 on it currently.. I estimate it's worth about $52-$54k.

Insurance: \~$130 via Metromile (cheapest we can find)

Stipend to parents: \~$500.  This is a temporarily thing, but my parent's have been through a lot recently and have done right by me my entire life.  My mom lost her job, dad doesn't earn much, and it's been really hard for her, so we're helping out until she's back on her feet for the next year or two).

&amp;#x200B;

Living expenses

Food + household items: \~$350 goal.

Pet food, supplies: \~50

Vacation budget: $0.. we're not going anywhere right now.

Hobbies: $0, ideally we want to keep things tight right now. Maybe we could add a line item for discretionary monthly spending so we're not miserable.. but then again, maybe we should be considering where we are.

t3_cgyf7l,"Paying attention to my 401k saved my company's employees ~$92,000","This is a post about how even a little bit of attention can go a long way for you, and others. 

I work for a company with ~600 employees across North America. Since finding the personal finance communities two years ago, my family has been keeping an eye on our budgeting and saving, and I was having fun with it, so I started also keeping track of contributions into my 401k - nothing major, just a yearly look to see contributions, matches (my company matches 4%), and dividends.

One year I logged into my 401k provider (Fidelity) and ran my transaction history total for a year, and what caught my eye was a Fee for $12.50. To that date I had never seen a fee before. I called my HR/Benefits and they confirmed they had jumped the gun but that - starting next year - every employee would have a $12.50 recordkeeping fee charged yearly. They reimbursed me the $12.50 for that year, but I learned a lesson: 401ks (and the HR departments behind a company) were not infallible.  I added 'Fees' to my mental thing to check on during my year-end check.

2 years went by, until this last year. This year in February I pulled the 2018 totals for my 401k, and noticed that my contribution and my year-end total seemed off, by about $150 or so. I couldn't figure it out. Finally, I went to the transaction history of my 401k and looked through it. And there I saw it: a company **match** of *negative* $153.95, back in March. It was the strangest thing! It wasn't tied to any actual contribution; it was just sitting out there, all by itself. It wasn't even listed under 'Fees'. It was just a *negative* company match. (Shout out to everyone who has ever complained about their company match or lack thereof - at least you've never had a *negative* one!) And I knew it wasn't just those dollars I was missing - it was all those dollars that those dollars were going to make, and the dollars *those* dollars would make, for decades to come. 

I started asking around. My HR department said there were no reported problems and that if I wanted a detailed walkthrough of my 401k contributions, I could wait two weeks until I had a meeting with the benefits coordinator. I said, 'Schedule it'. But I didn't stop there. I started asking my coworkers, and guess what - *everyone* had a negative company match on that date. I had 5 confirmed cases, then 10, then 20. The amounts all varied, but it was always on the same March date. 

By this point I got enough people riled up that I ended up talking to the head of Benefits, who confirmed that, okay, maybe there was a problem. It took 2 months for them to confirm, at which point we found out that a payroll 'true-up' calculation had incorrectly counted a week that crossed from year-to-year as two weeks, and then had automatically 'corrected' for the doubled amount. It took 2 more months for them to finally correct it. I'm sure some of my coworkers contribute less and some contribute way more, but 600 employees * $153.95 = $92,370.  Meaning that every person in the company had a hand in some $92000 missing from their 401k... but I was the only one who had bothered to check. 

I know most people don't ever calculate out their paycheck or look at their 401k. And I'm not saying you should on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. But every once in a while, take 5 or 10 minutes and grab that paper copy of your paycheck, or hit that 'Forgot password' button, log on to your system, and take a little look over how much money you're getting - be it paycheck, 401k, or whatever - and see whether it makes sense to you. You might be surprised what you find.

Edit: If i'm reading this FAQ correctly, then the settlement isn't even for $700 million;

&amp;#x200B;

Equifax will pay at least $380,500,000 into a Consumer Restitution Fund. The Consumer Restitution Fund will be used to:

* Make cash payments for Out-of-Pocket Losses and Time Spent (see [**FAQ 7**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-7));
* Purchase Credit Monitoring Services (see [**FAQ 8**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-8));
* Pay cash Alternative Reimbursement Compensation to Settlement Class Members who already have their own credit monitoring or identity protection coverage before making a claim (see [**FAQ 10**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-10));
* Make cash payments for Subscription Product Reimbursement;
* Purchase Restoration Services for all Settlement Class Members, regardless of whether they make a claim (see [**FAQ 11**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-11));
* Pay the costs of notifying Settlement Class Members and administering the settlement;
* Pay service awards to the Settlement Class Representatives, as approved by the Court (see [**FAQ 22**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-22));
* Pay attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses, as approved by the Court (see [**FAQ 21**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-21)).

&amp;#x200B;

If the Consumer Restitution Fund is used up, Equifax will pay up to an additional $125,000,000 to pay Out-of-Pocket Losses (see [**FAQ 13**](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/faq#q-13)).

* keep in high interest savings account (2% or higher yield)


**2) Employer Sponsored Retirement Plan (401k, 403b, 457, etc.) Match**

* max out the employer match completely; this is usually a few percent
* ~~VCIT~~ VFINX for stocks (90%) and VCIT for bonds (10%) if possible; if not, go for low fees and a broad fund


**3) Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA’s)**

* a Roth IRA is usually better when younger and in a lower tax bracket
* max out the allowed contribution (currently $6000 per year)
* can invest anywhere, so the best ones are 70% in VTSAX for US stocks, 20% in VTIAX for international stocks, and 10% in VTBLX for bonds


**4) Health Savings Accounts (HSA’s)**

* provided you have a high deducible plan
* generally, it is a good idea to max out the allowed amount ($3500 for an individual, per year and $7000 for a family, per year)
* it uses pre-tax income, and is withdrawn tax-free, provided it is used for health expenses
* it grows tax-deferred
* considered an “above the line” deduction for taxes
* if not used by age 65, can either use it for health expenses normally, or any expenses (if used for regular expenses, the money gets taxes, but not penalized, when withdrawn; if used for regular expenses, this is just like a normal IRA
* consider this a retirement account, making a separate budget for medical expenses, and saving the medical receipts to cash out when needed
* invest in ~~VCIT~~ VFINX for stocks (90%) and VCIT for bonds (10%)


**5) Finish Maxing the 401K**

* after taking advantage of a company match, a more versatile IRA, and a HSA that offers more of a tax break (provided you use it for medical expenses), go back to your 401K and finish maxing it out at $19,000 per year
* hopefully your company offers a good fund with low expenses (same distribution and funds as discussed in your company match section)


**7) Real Estate**

* this is not for everyone, and is more hands on, but is a great way to build wealth and diversify after maxing your retirement accounts
* save up a down payment for a single family home or multifamily home (or whatever you decide to focus on) using a high yield savings account or safe investment


**8) Taxable Investment Accounts**

* depending on your situation, you may want to put this above, or instead of, real estate investing, as it's a little simpler
* there are no restrictions on income, when you can take out the money, etc. for taxable brokerage accounts; this makes it a great option for a bridge account
* suggested portfolio is 70% in VTSAX, 20% in VTIAX, and 10% in VTBLX",personalfinance

t3_chpkzw,Preparing for substantial rent increase [US],"EDIT: gross pay is about 70k/yr, I'm single, rent is $1300/month, I have \~$460k in retirement investments and \~$160k in nonretirement investments. Car payments are a little over $300/mo. Other than car, which will be paid off next year, I have zero debt.

&amp;#x200B;

I've just found out that my apartment building is for sale. I'm currently paying WAY under-market for my apartment... I've been there for nine years and my rent has barely increased, while rents throughout the region have gone up substantially. If the building sells, either my rent will go up a lot (possibly over double what I'm currently paying) or they'll tear the building down and I'll be evicted. Either way, finding another apartment that's the same price as what I'm currently paying is unrealistic, even if I downsize.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I've always been good about my retirement savings. I'm 50 years old.  I put away 15% post-tax into a Roth 401k, and my current savings (retirement + some non-retirement savings) is over 8 times my salary, which, from what I have learned from various financial websites, is really good for my age.

&amp;#x200B;

My budget doesn't have a lot of leeway while I continue to put 15% post-tax into retirement and I have a year left of car payments. I have more options once my car is paid off next year, but still below the median rent for the region.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I'm 50. When they tell you that the most important savings years are when you're younger, the corollary seems to be that the money you put in in your 50s won't grow as much. So, given my generally good retirement account situation, I'm considering scaling back my retirement contributions.

&amp;#x200B;

Another option is to find a roommate situation somewhere. I don't really want to do it (I've grown quite accustomed to being independent) but I have two different friends that have reached out to me saying that they have, or will have in the near future, a room for rent. And honestly they both seem like guys that I'd get along with as roommates.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, just because the building is on the market doesn't mean that I'll be forced out any time soon; so I can always hope that my rent situation won't change anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do people think?

t3_chol95,Saving and Retirement Questions. (26yrOld),"Hello!

Here is my situation and I am looking for guidance on what to do from this point on.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 26 years old and married. We keep our finances completely separate and split bills to even it out. So essentially I am saving for retirement on my own (she is also). I make 50K a year and put 10% of my biweekly check into 401K which equals 15% after company match. I have roughly 15K in a savings account for saving. This is not touched by expenses.

Here are my questions:

1. How much do I need in that savings account? 6 months of income?
2. I only have a 401K. Should I open an IRA or something for more retirement saving? What is the best option for me regarding my age?
3. I also have about 8K left on an auto loan. Is it worth using some of the savings to pay that off now or just wait? The interest was only like $900 of the 17K loan.

That is all I can think of for now. If you made it this far, thank you for taking time out of your day to possibly help me out. I try to be as financially smart as I can although I do need some guidance.

t3_chogdg,How is this budget for being a college student?,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

&amp;#x200B;

How is this budget for being a college student? I am currently enrolled full-time at a community college going for IT, and while I am busy with school, I want to cement my spending habits in stone as soon as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I've come up with a budget for my next year of living, could anyone please look at this and suggest room for improvement?

&amp;#x200B;

**The following numbers will be displayed in CPM(cost per month)**

*College Tuition: ($1800 a semester)Covered*

*Rent: $440 a month(covered)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Income per month:**

*One part time job: $****620*** *per month*

**My personal budget:**

**Mandatory Payments:**

*Internet: $11*

*Electric: $30*

*Heat: $35*

*Food: $160*

**Total: $236 a month**

&amp;#x200B;

**Non-mandatory payments:**

*Gym: $60 a month*

*Coffee: $30 per month*

*Eating Out: $50 per month*

*Misc Expenses: $50 per month*

**Total: $190 per month**

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me with **$194** a month as ""savings"". 

I plan on investing 10% of my income into a Roth IRA, so I'd have **around $132** a month saved

&amp;#x200B;

Any ways I could improve this? As far as the **non-mandatory expenses** go, I put VERY high numbers on that. I don't eat out at all right now, so that could effectively go to $0, and I have misc expenses down at $50 just to have a buffer of any random things I want to spend.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fortunate enough to be able to live car-free in my situation, and my school offers a free public transit pass. I do plan on getting a higher paying part time job, and possibly getting a second job. I would not be able to stay out of debt if I was to own a car, and honestly I do not plan on owning one unless I would absolutely need one.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on improvements? I'm not necessarily worried about the actual dollars at this point, but rather the habits that I can carry over to when I get a full time job after school.

t3_chqjkr,Saving up for next year's max IRA contribution?,"I opened an IRA in January of this year for the first time and contributed the full amounts for both 2018 and 2019 at that point because I had the savings to do so, and based on advice found on this sub generally wanted to maximize time in the market. I thought at that point in time that it would make sense for me to start saving $500/month so that when Jan 2020 comes around I will have enough to max my contribution early for that year as well. I am realizing now however that this may not be the optimal solution as the money I am saving throughout the year is just sitting in a HYSA instead of spending time in the market.

At the end of the day I guess my main question is does it make sense for me to save up money throughout this year in order to max out my IRA contribution in January of next year?

Would it be more worth it if I was putting it into a taxable brokerage account instead of just an HYSA?

Or am I better off just making monthly contributions to my IRA throughout the year with the money I was previously saving?

1. Plan to use the proceeds from the sale of our current home to pay for the down payment on the new house  Depending on timing this may require us to put in an offer on contingency which I know puts us at a disadvantage.  We definitely will have more than enough to cover a 20% down payment, realtors' fees and closing costs once the current house sells.
2. Spend the next few years saving up enough to cover down payment + closing costs on the new house so we don't have to worry about the timing of current house selling first, etc.  We would need to save about $100k for this to be on the safe side, so about $2800/mo for the next few years which we could really only achieve by reducing our retirement contributions.

t3_chk0lg,Buying a cheap condo outright VS renting &amp; investing savings,"I made a throwaway because I don't want to discuss my finances on my regular account.

So I'm a very lucky young (26m) professional. Between my own savings from my old jobs and inheritance money, plus money my parents put aside for me, I currently have almost 450k (CAD) that I can spend on my future. Which is... Ridiculous at my age. And I'm a little overwhelmed.

I live in Toronto (I guess that's worth disclosing), where the housing market is a little fucked, and a low-to-okay condo will run you at least 350k-400k+. Rent for a one bedroom condo is anywhere between $1500 to $2000+.

Now my actual question is whether it seems like a good idea to buy a condo with all my savings (around 400k-500k) OR find somewhere with reasonably cheap rent ($1000-$1700/month, depending on if I have roommates) and invest the \~450k CAD banked, ideally aiming for 5% yield on investment per year (but not guaranteed) through stocks and the like.

My instinct (and my parents' instincts, and others), is that it makes the most sense to buy now since I'll have virtually no mortgage if I get a cheapy place, but when I run the numbers I get a bit more confused, because it seems like I could make more money by investing (assuming I could consistently make \~5%/year) and renting.

For slightly more concrete numbers, lets say I manage to get a place $1500/month rent (could be higher or lower, but around there). And let's say I invest the $400k I have now at 5% per year, and for simplicity's sake assume I don't add money. Over 10 years I'd net \~$652k total banked, and 25 years I'd net \~$1.354m total banked from the \~400k invested. And rent would cost me $180k for 5 years, and $450k for 25 years (assuming rent didn't go up a ton, which is a huge assumption). With these numbers, it looks like after 10 years of renting &amp; investing the 400k, I'd have $472k and after 25 years I'd have $904k banked from to 400k invested, after subtracting rent costs. Whereas if I bought I would only have the condo to show for it, which could go up in value but probably not as much, and that's hard to say for sure.

Also this isn't even to mention that if I bought a condo I'd have maintenance fees of $300-$700 per month, which is a massive cost per year even if I DO own the place. So really it seems like buying is much worse in the long term than renting &amp; investing @ 5% per year (assuming I can uphold that).

Thoughts? I know this is a lot of word vomit, this is just kind of stuff that I've been confused about for a while, and it seems like my parents and friends don't understand why I'm even considering renting &amp; investing. Everyone seems to think as soon as you have the down payment money you should just go for it, which seems stupid to me. But perhaps it's worth it for me to buy a place if I won't have a mortgage.

t3_chq9ce,401k for down payment,Is is a terrible idea to take 8k out of 15k in my 401k to put on a down payment for a house?

t3_chq8mz,"When adjusting stock/bond allocations to manage risk as you age, does a change in allocation affect your current investments, or future investments?","I’ve been having a little trouble understanding this, so here’s an example depicting what I’m trying to figure out: 

Assume a 29-year old person allocating 20% of their current 401(k) contributions to bonds and 80% to stocks. Also assume this person is just starting a retirement fun contributes $10,000 that year.

When this person turns 30, they decided they were being too risky and should abide by the rule of thumb that bond allocation should equal age and bump up the bond percent allocation from 20% to 30%. They contribute $15,000 that year.

Does the increase from 20% to 30% mean that the entire fund’s allocation is shifted that amount, meaning the $10,000 from the previous year is also adjusted to fit this new 30% allocation, or is this only for the future $15,000 investments after the allocation was changed? What does the age rule of thumb actually refer to—adjusting future contributions with less risk as you get older, or adjusting the entire account with these new percentages?",personalfinance

t3_chq1pk,Hiring negotiation help for job title level and salary,"Hi PF, I'm in the hiring process for my job right now and could use some negotiation advice since I have no prior experience doing it. I've already worked my position on a temporary contract basis for a few years, and I'm being converted to a permanent role. The situation's doubly confusing to me because it's in a weird area between a promotion (no negotiation in my company) and a new offer (lots of negotiation). I've already completed my interviews, and I have a meeting set up with my current/hiring manager next week to talk about my conversion. I'd like to go into that meeting with a good game plan.

Some facts about the situation:

* Job prereqs: the job is in R&amp;D and has 4 levels. Non-PhD candidates usually start in level 1-2 depending on experience. PhD candidates start in level 2-3. I have a masters, plus 3 years of experience working here. I meet the prereqs for both levels 1 and 2.

* Pay: the pay is according to set pay bands, but there's no corporate requirements for where in the pay band a new hire starts. My current pay puts me at 30th percentile in the level 1 band, and 8th percentile in the level 2 band. My manager confirmed a pay raise when I convert.

* Responsibilities: Level 1 is a more junior role which expects some troubleshooting on projects, reporting, but not much else. Level 2 expects more independent research ideas and control over projects. My current work consists of unofficial leading a few projects but assisting roles on others; the plan is to officially lead my unofficial projects within a couple years after my conversion.

* Corporate timelines: Generally promotion from one level to the next takes at least 3-5 years. Changes this year have hard-capped the number of promotions though, so they're expected to become much harder now compared to the past.

* Hiring mood at HR: word is that due to the low unemployment rate and general trouble attracting young people to this company, offers for new grad hires have them starting at higher than people who's been working here for ~5 years. To me, this translates to them starting at at least 30-50th percentile of the pay bands. 

* My supervisor (a level 4) supports me hiring into level 2. I do not yet have a gauge on my manager's opinion.

* I don't expect an official offer to come from HR for at least a couple weeks. My meeting with my manager next week will likely be before seeing an offer.

Unless more has already been decided on the HR side than I'm aware of, I should be able to negotiate for both a job level and salary. I'm just now sure what my approach should be and which one to prioritize if I have to pick. 

* Do I focus on a ""I meet exceed/meet requirements"" direction?

* Or ""compare me to a new hire"" direction?

* Since the paybands have tons of overlap, do I prioritize arguing for more pay regardless of job title, or job title first and foremost? The difference in max allowed salary between the two levels is 20k, so starting in the lower one would cap me faster and promotions may take a long time. But my performance evals would likely be much better since I already exceed the requirements for that level.

* Do I even bring up salary at the meeting next week or wait until I see an official offer?

* How aggressively do I pursue this? Both in how high of a salary I ask for, and what language I use to communicate how firm I feel about my number. I like working here, and I'm not interviewing anywhere else. Realistically I'd accept their offer regardless, but a worse offer would tempt me to look elsewhere faster (I assume I don't say this. Or imply this?). My manager and supervisor both have acknowledged that they're committed to getting me to stay longterm so I have some leverage, but I don't want to seem ungrateful either. Not sure the latter is a valid concern? I know the typical advice is ""the worst they can do is say no"" but we're all emotionally invested by this point so there's bound to be some more subjective feelings involved than a new job negotiation.

* Anything else I should consider to argue my case? Or going against me that I should try to mitigate?

I have a plan in mind, but I just want to confirm that I'm going about it the right way.  

My current car is a financed 2010 G37. NADA values it at around ~$10,700, and I owe about $8,500. Monthly car expenses (this can vary depending on the mileage driven) are as follows:  

* $250 monthly loan  
* $210 insurance  
* $180 gas  

I like cars. It's the main reason I bought it, but at this point, I am absolutely fed up with the terrible efficiency (15 miles/gallon).  


Income is about $3000/month. Other expenses are about $1500/month. This includes rent, student loans, groceries and other utilities. I have about $10k in savings, which the rest of the income goes to. I have no credit debt or any other debt.  

My plan is to sell the car and buy a 2008-2009 Honda Fit or other similar cars for about $3,000 out of my savings. My car needs about $1,000 in maintenance pretty soon (brakes, a broken sensor and oil changes). I currently have it up for sale for $10,200, and have received an offer from CarMax for $8,800 which is valid for the next 7 days. If I sell it privately, I'll have to take care of the maintenance, but CarMax will take it as is.

t3_chph1m,Drowning and desperate,"Hi, all.

Just a little backstory: I (24/F) live with my husband (36), mother in law (60+) and my father in law (70+). We also have two kids (2 and 1) and we’re pregnant with another baby. My mother and father in law do not work, but they get monthly social security which is about $2200. I work full time making between $900-$1000 every two weeks. My husband is on long term disability working towards total disability and makes approximately $2000 a month. In total, we bring in roughly $6200, give or take.


We just got news that my husband’s long term disability claim was cancelled even though his medical appointments are outrageous, close to 8-10 a week. We are terrified for that loss of income.

Now, we make good money combined but we also all have poor spending habits. My mother and father in law love pawn loans and payday loans and more often than not have 3-4 going at any given time. Rather than pay any off, they keep renewing them.  My husband and I are just plain dumb financially speaking. We don’t do things intelligently and are always behind on bills, not to mention we are deep in debt and trying to file bankruptcy.

What are some little things we can do to start making things easier on ourselves? We’re desperate for any types of advice that we may not have thought of or just need to be reminded of.",personalfinance

t3_chpel5,Questions about a driving job reimbursement,"So I recently took a job that is to drive a kid from his house, to an appointment, I’m free for 3 hours, and then from the appointment back home. 5 days a week. Round trip this is 40 miles including driving back to my house. I think it’s valid to include the driving to my house due to the nature of the job. You can’t just pay me for the 15 minutes of driving from point A to point B here. When I took the job they had not yet given me the addresses so it was impossible to figure how much to charge. 

When I took the job they said it was 5-10 minutes to drop him off. It’s closer to 15 minutes, but it takes me a total of an hour out of my day 2 x a day to do the job. We agreed on an extra $5 a day for mileage, which I now know is not nearly enough. I calculated from the IRS mileage reimbursement rate of $0.58 per mile, mileage reimbursement should be $23.20 minus the $5 already given. 

I’m being compensated $35 a day including the $5 for mileage. Any thoughts or recommendations on how to bring this up? I communicate with the family via text, they’re not there for pick ups or drop offs. The grandmother is there watching the kid. I like the family and don’t want to do this in the wrong way. They’re planning on paying me more when they need more childcare, in September at a rate of $20 per hour, which is what we originally agreed upon. Although I know I’m not currently making that because it takes much longer than anticipated to complete the job. But if we address the mileage concerns, I would be more than happy.

I recently accepted a written offer to a new position that I will be starting in the near future. When I initially received the verbal offer from my soon-to-be manager, they stated the 401k match would be a full match up to a certain %. However, upon receiving the written offer, it was a partial percentage equaling a lower match (about a $2K/year difference). I knew that it was less than initially discussed but I didn't fully process the difference due to my excitement/adrenaline at the time and was just plain excited to accept the offer as a whole - so I went ahead and signed.

t3_chp8jh,Multiple hard pulls for same loan.,"Hey folks. I'm struggling with interpreting what is and isn't allowed with my credit in this situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the deal. Last fall, I signed a contract for solar panels. I did the loan application then, to qualify for the install. Install did not happen until spring (due to weather). Since the install was more than 6 months since the last pull, they told me I would have to do a new credit pull. Irritating, as I was in the middle of a name change at the time. I filled out the new application and provided my current IDs, where I had my new name on my social security card, and the in-the-process-of-being-renewed-drivers-license with my old name. The application was stalled due to the discrepancy. I submitted documentation of the name change, etc., and was assured there wouldn't be two hard pulls that day because they were in the same business day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Surprise - there were two hard pulls. I wrote requesting they fix this before I pursue options through the credit agencies. I was given statements like, ""we're still looking into it"" repeatedly through the next two months. In the meantime, my loan was sold to a new credit union, placing yet another hard pull on my credit. I wrote to the original loan holders with a request for information regarding what steps had been taken between each step of the emails stating they were looking into it, whether they were federally or state chartered, whether the credit union my loan was sold to was federally or state chartered, what U.S. states any maintenance or activities on my account have taken place in, and where was I notified of another hard pull to sell my loan. I have not received a response. **I now have 4 hard pulls on my credit for this singular solar loan, dropping my credit score 90 points.** Two seems somewhat acceptable due to the 6 month window of time between pull and servicing of the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan was to finance about $10k of this through a pre-approved loan, but after talking to Bank of America because the dealership I'm buying from isn't just a FORD dealer, I can't get the regular auto-loan rate of like 3.5% and would have to get a private party rate of more like 6%.

I have great credit of 800, no other debt, so I was assuming that financing for a rate of 3-4% wouldn't be a bad call and I could keep my cash reserves while keeping a pretty low car payment. Now that I'm looking at closer to 6% though I'm debating on if I should just take the leap and pay all cash? Also, are there other banks or credit unions that would offer me more of a traditional loan rate for this type of dealer, or is that pretty typical for a place that specializes in just a wide range of used cars?

t3_chp5iz,Mortgage vs. Daycare,"Hello PF!

Some background: My husband is a CNC Machinist at his dad’s shop and I work in Human Resources for a small community bank. We have a 2 year old son and a baby girl on the way. We are currently living with his dad to save as much as we can because we want to build our own home. We already have land to build said home on. 

Advice needed: We are considering having me staying home once our daughter is born. We are currently paying $800 in daycare (I know this is apparently very cheap, we live in rural North Carolina). However with the birth of our daughter we would be paying double, so $1600 a month. That is completely insane to me as we could start paying for a mortgage with that money. 

I have no bills. I usually just pay our phone bill ($100 and groceries.). We recently paid off all of my debt, just a personal loan I had taken out last year. The only real debt we have is my husband’s truck that’s is financed. 

My husband doesn’t know if it’s a good idea for me to stop working and have the mortgage payment work out and us barely scraping by. 

I’ll break down our expenses below and see if anyone has any advice or experiences with your partner being a SAHM(D). 

Truck payment: $360/month

Insurance: $200/month 

Groceries: $250/month

Phones: $100/month 

Daycare: $800/month (can be cut out if I stop working)

Gas: $120/month(could be slashed in half if I stop working)

We don’t pay for any utilities right now because we live with his dad. Once we build we would only really pay for electric as we would have well water. 

My husband makes about $4,000 a month. I make about $1600 a month which would be what we pay in daycare a month. Breaking even with that doesn’t make sense to me. He thinks we are going to struggle. I feel like we can do this. Especially because I’m ready to start building our home and have our own space.

We’re supposed to be closing tomorrow, but Wednesday evening the lender sends us the closing disclosure and it shows a new note of ~$1,531 and $5k cash to close. So I called and complained because this seemed like drastic increases. The lender agreed to look into it yesterday. 

After a while, he told me that they were able to keep our close date on Friday, and got the new note lowered all the way to ~$1,460, and back down to $4,400 cash to close. This seemed suspiciously low to me, since our monthly escrow was at $289/mo. Our homeowners insurance is $1,570, and our flood is $570.

We filed a homestead exemption, and were assessed $27.4k, with a savings of about $870 in property taxes. Please note I’m not entirely sure what those numbers mean, nor do, on our homestead exemption.

I called the title company to confirm with them that we won’t run into an escrow shortage at the end of the year and have to cough up money to cover it or have our note increase. They confirmed that the current amount in the escrow on the CD is correct, but if the property taxes do get reassessed, which they will, we will have a shortage.

Basically, I’m not sure how to proceed from here. Should I tell our lender that we want the property taxes estimated to what they believe it will be after a reassessment? If that’s the case, I believe we will get a check back with the overage amount at the end of the year since we were overpaying for taxes that haven’t gone up yet.

Would greatly appreciate any insight on this, as I’ve never come across this situation before and neither has anyone else I’ve spoken to (or they were just too unaware to realize it). Thanks in advance, all.",personalfinance

t3_chow8w,Moving from non-exempt to exempt position,"I've been at the same job for 8 years, a non-exempt entry level position. I've been offered a job at a more senior level at a different company for about 40% more money, which is great, but the position is ""exempt"", meaning that it is not eligible for overtime compensation in the event of overtime.

My current position is ""non-exempt"", but overtime is nonexistent. I don't like overtime anyway- I value my free time too much. My concern about moving to an exempt position, even for 40% more money, is that if overtime happens even occasionally, the lack of overtime compensation make the salary less appetizing.

Are there any pitfalls to look for when moving from a ""non-exempt"" to an ""exempt"" position? On the bright side, I'm hopeful that it will allow for more flexible scheduling- i.e., since they're not responsible for paying me overtime it means they don't need to track my hours as closely and so I may have more flexibility with regard to the hours I work, as long as the job gets done. I'm just not sure how to gently ask what the typical expected overtime is. Even when paid, I hate working overtime, and I would hate it much more if it wasn't paid.",personalfinance

t3_chop4o,(FL) Title Loan for a car that's now mechanically totaled. Do I still owe? What do I do?,"On the verge of homelessness and desperation, I took out a title loan against the only real object of value I had - my car. I got just enough from it for first and last for an apartment that I needed.
At the time, my income provided more than enough means to resolve the issue, and I'd been paying it down as quickly as I've been able to because I know the financial trap of these loans.

Unfortunately, I believe my car's flywheel shattered. (I drive stick, and this component allows the car to get into, and out of gear).

While (mostly?) mechanically sound - it does start - it does not run. I'm paying for additional comprehensive coverage through the loan (per required, in case of accident) - but I was told it would be anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 to replace the part depending on what other components were damaged (Clutch, etc).

I'm going over my loan documentation and do not see anything in it that covers mechanical failure (enough to warrant the car undrivable) that would end the contract, or would assist me in any way in paying for the vehicle's repairs. 

To make this worse, it was my primary method of transportation to work - and it's failure had rendered me jobless. With what little savings I've managed to hang onto (Thanks, PersonalFinance!) - I've instead now budgeted for survival instead. 

My payment is coming up, and if there's a way to just rid myself of this mess (even at the expense of my credit), I'd love your thoughts.

Is the best way just to say I believe the untrained person is compensated at a higher rate than me? do I say this is ""unfair"" or use other language.

4 Wednesday, 8:57pm: still pending

5 Thursday: 9:48am: no-longer pending

t3_chgvpo,Confirming grandparents address from the 1950s in order to obtain unclaimed properties in their name?,"I recently found that upon searching my family name on missingmoney.com, my grandparents both had unclaimed property in their name from an address in New Jersey.

t3_chnoqb,Save for Down Payment or Max Retirement Accounts,"Hi everyone - so I am currently 25yo and looking to buy a town-home/house next July when our lease is up. I am recently engaged to my awesome fiance and we plan to get married next September. We live in the N. Virginia area so housing prices are VERY high.. even for rinky-dink town-homes :(

My question is: is it beneficial right now to save up for a **20%** down payment on our future home, **OR** contribute the max possible amounts to our 401k/IRAs? By FIRE I will not want to have a mtg payment, so to help with that I'm thinking it would help if we don't have to pay PMI in our early years to help us gain equity in our homes faster. But are we taking to long to enjoy all the advantages of the tax deffered accounts?

Background info:

* Fiance and I both 25yo; 
* Combined annual income: $135k/yr;
* Consolidated NW: \~$95k
   * Cash: \~$65k ($15k of which is predetermined emergency fund)
   * Retirement: \~$30k
* No debt (fiance just recently paid off all student loans! so proud of her :'D)
* Live in N. Va (HCOL area) but try to maintain a savings-rate of 55-60%

I get a collections letter last year(2018) and reported it to the FCC and they put me in touch with a higher up Comcast rep. The rep said they charged me for the non-working service saying that I should have just canceled it earlier instead of waiting for their technicians to attempt and fix it. Obviously the brain dead Comcast rep just repeated themselves and the conversation amounted to no resolution. I responded back to the FCC and they never replied back so I never ended up paying the collections

Now a year later, the collections bill resurfaces again. I plan to dispute it again so should I still file a FCC complaint against Comcast for it? And the collections agency wants a written letter if I choose to dispute the debt, so should I inform the collections agency that I intend to report it to the FCC or not even mention it at all?

My girlfriend works for a company that requires her to work every other weekend ""on call"" where ""on call"" is her working non-stop from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm on Saturday and Sunday. They pay $60 per day for this extra work. It's all overtime but they're calling it ""on call"".

A few weeks back she had to go into the office to work for some time on a Saturday. When she let them know afterward that she put in 6 hours on site on Saturday they balked and eventually told her she would *not receive pay for these hours worked.* There is no documentation for this. I am considering it lost time/money at this point but it should illustrate how scummy these people are.

My advice to her was starting tomorrow to let them know she is not comfortable working for the amount they're offering. $60 a day for the amount of work she is performing is under minimum wage. She ends up working 12 days in a row for pennies. My question becomes: if they tell her tough shit, what should she do?

t3_chjg7v,Should I buy this house after the inspection came back with some concerns,"House is a new construction townhome, $975k in Seattle area.

Basically, we put in an offer with $10k earnest money 30 days ago to close this Friday (7/26). When we made the offer, it was clear there was plenty of remaining work on the home but both agents assured us the builder had said it could be done in 30 days. Now it's 2 days before closing and we had the third party inspection today. There is a lot of work left (basically everything from 30 days ago that hasn't been touched). And the inspector found more items, however the purchase agreement doesn't have a contingency on fixing the inspection items. The builder told us Monday that whatever is not done by closing and what the inspector finds (within his idea of reason), they will come fix by appointment afterward. However, we're concerned that once the builder has his money, he's not going to do anything about it. At this point, the leftover stuff is thousands of dollars of labor. Instead of making a $975k mistake, should we eat the $10k earnest money and walk away?

Also, there were several contingencies in the earnest money agreement where we requested the garage be painted and the floor coated. Doesn't look like that will be done by Friday. If these things aren't done, could that entitle us to our earnest money back?

Edit: We put in notice at our current apartment and paid to break our lease. That was also expensive ($7k), the first thing I'm going to do once the leasing office opens tomorrow is call and see if there's any way we can stay. However, there are enough of open apartments in the area giving good concessions that we could conceivably move to another apartment and make most of that $7k back.

So I budgeted for the low-deductible PPO plan which will cost me $215 a month. I know it's a lot, but I need to try seeking therapy for anxiety and depression and this way the appointments are only a $30 copay. I'll reevaluate when my coverage opens up, but if I'm doing weekly or bi-monthly appointments this plan only costs me $15 a month over the high-deductible one once you take those into account.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm not sure about is dental, vision, and all the small things that add up - life insurance, disability insurance, accidental death. Part of me thinks, oh, I'll just add on some low value, it'll probably only add $3 a month or something. Since I'm young, that's actually the case for a lot of it. Dental is either $9 or $13 a month if I get orthodontia insurance, vision is like $2.60 a month.

My question is, how much of this should I be investing in as a young adult? I'm not sure if I should just move $10 a month around and have some pretty solid life insurance or what. I'm single so it would really only go to family or something... but it's not like my family couldn't use it.

t3_che0d4,Mom was hospitalized with leukemia in May and now my aging parents don't have enough income to pay their bills. I'm managing their finances for the first time. How can I make them comfortable?,"Dad (68yo, Vietnam vet and disabled machinist) and mom (67yo, ill waitress) both receive social security directly deposited into their checking account on the second Wednesday of every month. Dad gets $2005.00 and mom gets $659.00. They live in Pennsylvania.

Until May, this income was supplemented by mom's part time serving job which pulled in $540/mo on average, not including cash tips. This was keeping their heads above water, but now she's hospitalized with acute myeloid leukemia and it's gone, probably permanently.

The current balance in their checking account is $1509.97, which is the remainder of a very generous $2250 grant I was able to procure for them with the help of a social worker. It's a buffer, but it won't last long. September's bills are on the horizon.

I know that I need to reduce their expenses, but I don't know the 'best' way how, or what helpful options are even available to me, if any. I would be so grateful for any experienced guidance. I'm willing to work hard.

Here's the arithmetic:

* **Total combined monthly income: $2664.00**
* **Total combined monthly expenses: $2843.55** [dropping to $2395.72 in November]

**Housing** [$1430.70/mo]

* **Mortgage**: $1230.94/mo [Balance: $103,381.42 @ 5.375%]
* **Home Equity**: $199.76/mo [Balance: $16,201.60 @ 7.39%] -- *Past due $1,195.44 as of 2019/07/24*

**Utilities** [$392.85/mo avg]

* **Oil**: $212.00/mo avg
* **Electric**: $140.39/mo avg
* **Water**: $40.46/mo

**Auto** [$600.54/mo, dropping to $152.71/mo in November]

* **Car payment**: $447.83/mo [Balance: $1306.90 @ 17.59%]
* **Car Insurance**: $142.71/mo
* **AAA Roadside Assistance**: $10.00/mo

**Credit** [$143/mo minimum]

* **Capital One Platinum Mastercard**: $115.00/mo minimum [Balance: $3606.11 @ 25.15%]
* **CareCredit**: $28/mo minimum [Balance: $371.44 @ 26.99%]

**Data/Entertainment** [$276.46/mo avg]

* **Verizon FiOS TV/Internet/Phone Triple Play**: $236.46/mo avg [$320 early term. fee if canceled before 05/06/2021]
* **MetroPCS Cellphone**: $40/mo

How can I be the most effective here? Dad is home alone on the couch most of the time, so canceling his internet and cable television seems so cruel at a time like this, but I acknowledge that might be the first thing that has to go even with that $350 termination fee. After that, I'm just lost.

t3_chbc1c,"Being asked to pay a penalty I don't owe, they claim to keep correcting it but it won't go away","I'll just lay out the facts. This has to do with EZPass, which is a toll thing. 

-I live in NJ. Sometime in April, went through an EZPass toll thing in NY, but the pass apparently didn't scan. 3 weeks later, got a violation notice, please pay toll ($15)

-Go online to pay, but the website wasn't letting me check the box. Tried other browsers and computers, the thing just wasn't allowing me to pay it. Called them instead, they went in and said it was settled now, they charged $15 to the EZPass account, told me I didn't have to do anything.

-At the end of May, got another violation notice saying not only do you still owe $15, you now also owe a $50 late fee. Called them again, spoke to rep and explained everything -- she was confused why the first rep had told me that it was settled because it wasn't. She told me to draft a formal letter to EZPass with $15 enclosed, and explain the circumstances and ask to waive the late fee because it was an error with the website and the initial rep. She made a note in the account explaining all this too. I sent the letter first week of June with the $15 enclosed.

-Early July, I received a collection notice saying that I owe just the $50 penalty now, meaning they received my $15 but didn't read the rest of the letter or circumstances and moved forward with charging me the late fee anyway. Called EZPass and told them everything, they said they informed debt collection agency to waive the fee. It would take 20-30 business days for this to go through.

-Yesterday, July 23rd, got a notice from EZPass saying that I _still_ owe this late fee but they've given me a one-time courtesy offer of paying $25 instead of $50, and if I don't pay by mid-August, I will again owe the full $50. Called EZPass after receiving this letter, and that rep told me that it was all completely settled, including the initial violation and the amount sent to collections, said don't worry about it.

-I went online to check the violation number (on the EZPass violation website) and it was still there, so I was skeptical that this was actually settled. I called EZPass a second time and that rep told me that yes, they received the $15 for the original toll payment, but I still owe the penalty (hah!) and that the $25 was the best they could negotiate based on the facts they have and my letter to them. Supposedly they do have records of all the calls I made to them but they don't see any notes giving any further details (whereas past reps have mentioned that they _have_ added notes... so I'm not sure if they were deleted or removed or ignored or not entered in the first place). 

-They told me if I want to dispute the $25 payment I have to send _another_ letter, and I reiterated that the letters contain the same facts. She said I have to do that anyway, and that as much as they wanted to help, they don't make the decisions: the EZPass Violation Center is separate from the Port Authority that owns EZPass, and the Port Authority is the one that makes all these decisions. But apparently there's no number I can contact, I have to write a letter.

**tl;dr**

Toll pass didn't scan, but I couldn't pay it online so I called them to have it handled there. But the rep that supposedly took care of it didn't, so I am getting hit with a penalty fee that they keep trying to get me to pay even though every time I call they supposedly waive it / take care of it, but it never seems to actually get taken care of.

**My question**:

This is getting pretty ridiculous. What are my options here? I _already_ wrote a letter explaining that I don't owe this thing and instead they just chopped the thing in half. This has been dragging on for months and I refuse to pay this thing because I don't owe it and I'm not going to reward them for dragging this out longer and longer until I break down and pay it.

t3_chjqlf,Applying for Furniture Loan prior to closing (CAN),"Location: Ontario, Canada

A few minutes of googling has me in panic mode so really hoping we didn't make a huge mistake. Me (husband and I) have been approved for a mortgage and have an accepted offer on a home with a closing date of August, 2019. 

Its our first home - and we of course went shopping for some furniture; applying for the stores 'credit card' which is the way they finance purchases. We haven't heard yet regarding the application - but I was just surfing around on the internet, got a weirdly bad feeling and googled information about taking out loans before closing and basically a ton of websites came up saying it was a hugely bad idea and I am now sitting here losing my ever loving mind thinking we screwed ourselves.

 Am I right or will this not be a huge idea? We don't plan on actually USING the financing card until after closing however we applied for it now because honestly we just got excited and ahead of ourselves. So the card will remain with a 0$ balance on it until after closing. Does this make a difference?

Really hoping I am panicking over nothing.

t3_chhgpc,Have money to pay off CC debt but am afraid,"Looking for advice - of course.

I have about $8k in CC debt (14.15% APR) and theoretically enough to pay it off with my savings ($28k/2.2% interest HYSA) but am much too hesitant to do that because 1) i began my retirement savings far too late (at 35, am 37 now) and because my savings are absolutely ALL i have to fall back on.  

My last job was actually exempt from unemployment so i have some above average anxiety there as i was let go after 9 years. My current job does participate in unemployment luckily, not that i’m particularly concerned about it atm.

Other relative stats. Gross wages - $58K, 1.5 years left on my car lease ($140/month), no other debts.  Single, no kids, live alone in rented apt in an expensive part of the US (northeast) so it’s very difficult to save and is why i have not been able to kill much of the debt on my own thus far.

I know most would advise to use savings to pay off the CC debt which is accruing at 14% vs the 2% i’m receiving in interest.

t3_chmkny,Bank account in another country with zero balance,"Back in 2015 I opened up a debit bank account in Zambia, while I was working there for the year. I used to convert USD into local currency and use it instead of carrying cash with me constantly, and used it for a few online purchases. The plan was to close it when I left the country, but didn't have the time to formally close it. I think i left around $10 in there, and cashed out the rest before I left. I used up most of the remaining balance with an online purchase or 2 in the next year.

I returned there in 2017 on a holiday and tried to see if there was anything left in the account, but I had forgotten the PIN. I took the card to a bank, and they said it was negative with fees and that I had to clear those fees to get it activated again. I didn't have the cash flow to afford these fees (around $30) so I just left it.

I did a credit report earlier this week for the first time in my resident country, and nothing appears to be wrong, and my old bank account isn't mentioned at all.

Now my question is, is it worth properly closing this bank account, paying the outstanding fees, and taking the loss? Or is this something that I can just forget about. I was under the assumption that the bank would just close the account once the fees moved it to a credit amount. The bank account was purely debit, and had no credit facilities at all.",personalfinance
t3_chkq2y,Help! Trouble getting refunded for cancellation of the Extended Limited Warranty on my automobile,"Reddit, I am here seeking your advice on how to deal with a frustrating situation with Lithia Motors.

I bought a new Mercedes-Benz GLA250 with extended limited warranty in May 2016 from Mercedes-Benz of Beaverton (Lithia is the parent company). The car was financed through Gateway One Lending &amp; Finance (GOLF). Through the course of the term, GOLF sold the loan to a different lender, Regional Acceptance Corporation (RAC).

Now in 2019, in anticipation of selling the car, I decided to cancel the extended limited warranty. Since the extended warranty period hadn't started, I was entitled to receiving the full $2500 refund.

Despite documenting on the warranty cancellation form that RAC were the current lien holder to whom the check needed to be issued, Lithia said that they have to issue the refund check to the original lender and sent it to GOLF. It has been a month now since the refund check was sent to GOLF, but they haven't cashed it, forwarded it to RAC, or returned it to Lithia. Lithia say that in order to issue the refund check to me, they need documentation from GOLF stating that they no longer have any interest in the vehicle (Lien release from GOLF OR Letter on letterhead from GOLF with full VIN stating they have no interest in the vehicle). When I call GOLF customer service representatives, they say they don't own this account any more and cannot help me.

Please guide me on how to get my refund back!",personalfinance

t3_chhiab,"Fell for SSN phone scam, but don't have any credit history/lines of credit...How screwed am I &amp; what should I do? (19 y/o)","I know what you're thinking, I'm an idiot. At around 12:45pm, I received an automated telephone call saying that my social security number was being used to commit crimes in Texas and that if I did not call back there would be a warrant out for my arrest. It gave a number to call, but I just called the number that called me back.

&amp;#x200B;

I got on the phone with a female representative. She seemed to be really nice and just wanting to fix my problems. I explained how I had gotten a call about the suspicious activity with my social security number. She asked which phone it called and I told her the one I was currently calling from. She asked me my first and last name, which I gave to her. Then, she asked my birthday (which I gave to her). Next, she asked me for my social security number. I told her I did not feel comfortable giving that information out over the phone, however, I did give her the last four digits of my SSN. I know I was so fucking stupid and believe me, I'm kicking myself over it. After this, she told me that she was pulling up my file. Once it was pulled up, she continued on to ask me whether or not I had ever visited Texas before and I said yes, I have, however, it was many years ago. As she continued on, I began to get more and more weary about what this lady was saying. So I told her I needed to call my Mom before I did anything. Right after I said that, she promptly hung up...

&amp;#x200B;

I called my Mom and she told me that I shouldn't have given out that information, however, it wasn't like I gave the lady my whole social security number or any of my bank account information so it is unlikely that anything serious would happen. I ended up calling the number back a few times saying ""Hi, I called earlier and realized I accidentally gave you the wrong SSN"" whoever the operator was at the other side of the line would say ""Ok, what is your name?"" I would just hang up but eventually they just stopped answering my calls because I started to say that I felt like this wasn't the actual SSO. They answered once by accident and a lady said ""I know this number, hang up"" to the operator and they hung up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my Mom called back one time off of her personal cell phone and gave them my name, and when they asked for my SSN, she gave them a fake one. The operator told my Mom she was pulling up my file, and then continued on with the story about the crimes in Texas (EVEN THOUGH MY MOM HAD GIVEN MY NAME W/ A DIFFERENT SSN THAN THE ONE I HAD GIVEN BEFORE).

&amp;#x200B;

I called the SSO who told me that although I had given the last four digits, not to worry because they needed the full 9 digits to actually be able to do something. My bank assured me that if any fraudulent charges popped up I could dispute them. Lastly, I even went to the police station where the police told me to call one of the three credit bureaus and put a temporary fraud alert on my line of credit. I tried to do so by calling Equifax, however, the operator there told me that I would not be able to put a temporary fraud alert on my line of credit because I HAVE NO LINE OF CREDIT ESTABLISHED.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to take out a loan JUST to put a temporary fraud alert on my line of credit, however, I'm really worried about what the scammers can do with the information I gave them. The operator at Equifax assured me that it is not possible for them to open a line of credit with just my birthday, first and last name, and last four digits of SSN. I know I was so stupid, but the last four digits of SSN seem to be used for age verification on all sorts of websites, stuff for university etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit, is it worth it to try and take out a loan just to put a temporary fraud alert on my line of credit? Or should I be ok from the scammers? I'm not sure if they actually took down the information I gave them, considering when my Mom called they never even asked her for my birthday again. We never got to the point of the conversation where they asked me to give them my full SSN or take out money from any of my open checking/savings accounts. All of the officials I have spoken to (SSO, Equifax) seem to think that I am in the clear, however, online it looks like anyone with a birthday before 2011 does NOT have a randomized social security number and it is some sort of trial and error for scammers to find out the first five digits using your birthday and place of birth (bc that is what the first five digits are based off of).

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I can't freeze my credit unless I take out a loan or open up a credit card of some sort (which I do not need to do at this time). Is it worth it to take out a credit card I don't need simply to be able to freeze my credit?

t3_chk69n,How to Better Negotiate My Offer Package?,"Hi there

&amp;#x200B;

Hoping to get some guidance on the best way for me to negotiate my offer package. I'm 21 years old and live in California and this is a pretty well-off startup company but a fairly small team. \~$72.5M valuation / 10-15 people on the team

&amp;#x200B;

The initial offer was $100K + $5K for transportation and $10K worth of equity.

&amp;#x200B;

I negotiated to $110K ($5k transportation included in the 110) and $12K worth of equity in person (they said on an equity basis that's the furthest the investors are willing to go) I could probably squeeze out another $5K on the base but I know they've already stretched pretty far as the top of their range when hiring was $100K.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as the $5K transportation benefit -- does that make sense to have it included in my base salary where it would get taxed? or keep it as separate $5K allowance as originally offered?

&amp;#x200B;

How should I / can I negotiate this offer to make it a bit better without coming across as I'm nickle and diming them ? Also, for a private company -- how can I make for certain that the # of shares they are giving me equates to exactly $12k?

t3_chlvzb,What is the cost of my free time when Iam not working? Looking for best calculation,"There is some kind of misinformation spreading over and over, that if service/product costs X and you otherwise have to do it yourself in your free time for Y hours and your wage is in $/h, then if costs&gt;time * wage its worth doing it by yourself and if costs&lt;time * wage, you go buy it.

I know it is simple, **but thats not how it works and its not accurate at very basic level**. This can work when you are in company as an employee, but in reality you have a lot fixed costs and the time basis is not the same.

First, in reality, if you work you have like 6 hours free (not counting commuting) in workday and 16 on weekends, thats 62 hours per week or +-9 hours per day.

Second, you have to get rid of your lifestyle and fixed costs in this equation. If you have to pay mortgage/rent, car to get to work, utilities, food.... then your net income is much lower. Somebody who is living on the edge is at 0$ net income (including lifestyle).

So lets compare these two situations in example of wage 4000$/mo (25$/h), fixed lifestyle expenses 3000$/mo and you are deciding if you are not sure if its worth to repair something that the repair will cost you 80$ or it will take 4 hours of your time (youtube tutorial or you have to buy some tools)

**1) Classic calculation: 80&lt;4x25 ( =100), so you will spend money to get it repaired**

**2) My calculation 80&gt;4x(4000-3000)/62 ( =64), so you will repair it by yourself.**

If you look closely, the most influencing variable in this equation is the fixed costs or your lifestyle. 

If you are living on the edge with 0 net income (you spend all your money on your lifestyle), you have to do everything manually, because no matter how long it will take, you have 0$ to pay yourself 0$/h. You really cant afford to pay to someone else. You will be losing money.

If you live out off thin air as a homeless with 0 lifestlye and 0 fixed costs and still have income, you can outsource all the works to the others.

t3_chjfs1,Salary Negotiation | How do I tell my boss that I know my teammates make more?,"Thank you in advance for any advice, and sorry for the subsequent wall of text.

I've organized relevant details I've been mulling over and a rough timeline below.

I want to ask my employer for a raise to $65k from $55k (possibly more if you can help me justify an approximate 20%+ raise in the right way after receiving 10% the prior year) and I'm trying to figure out how to pose all of this in a way that doesn't seem accusatory or that makes it seem like I think I only deserve a raise because it's ""what's fair.""

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

I work for a small company in the Los Angeles area as an account manager and I currently make $55k annually. I worked at this company for a couple of years while finishing my bachelor's and then left for a short period of time because a) I didn't enjoy the team I worked on and b) the pay was too low. However, during the time I worked for them they liked me, my work ethic, and I know they felt I brought a lot of valuable skills to the table.

I came back when they had a sudden opening on another team that needed to be filled immediately and I was able to negotiate a salary I was somewhat happy with at the time. I asked for $55k and was started at $50k.

&amp;#x200B;

From there:

1. A few months later, my colleague was hired at $55k with no prior industry experience (I only recently found out what she made; I didn't know she started at $55k at the time). I used my skill-set and experience to train her.
2. At my one year review, I put together a summary of all that I do, how I go above and beyond, and salary averages for account managers in our area but only asked for a 10% increase to $55k as I didn't want to come off as too greedy. They increased my salary to $54k, which I now know is *still* $1k less than the teammate I trained started at. Instead of evening the playing field knowing that I was asking for the same exact starting salary as my teammate, they still only gave me $54k.
3. I also now know that another of my teammates with no prior experience was started at $65k a few years prior. I know I low-balled myself with my $50k-$55k negotiations, so I mention this not to say it's unfair, but to note that I know that someone that works the same job is making that amount.
4. I just passed my two year mark with the company after returning, so I'm in a good position to request another annual review.
5. Our company sales have consistently grown year after year and owners of the company rave about it, thanking all of us profusely, but continue to cheap out on salaries.
6. I put my all into my work as a standard, but I've been putting in 9-10 hour days consistently for the past few months working on growing a new account that is positioned to be one of our biggest clients. The numbers aren't quite where they need to be for me to use this as a raise selling point because they're still very new, but I can pull the numbers we have so far.
7. I established a tech platform that's been talked about in our company before, but never quite accomplished, and put in the legwork to get us to a point that we can successfully repeat this with other clients. I’m effectively now our in-house expert on this tech platform.
8. I have other selling points, but none that are too different from what I pitched at my first annual review. Do I repeat those as selling points? They're still valuable skills that set me apart, but I don't want to be too repetitive.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have a lot of ammo to successfully negotiate to $65k+ annually, but I need to know how best to use this knowledge.

Note: I know what my teammates make because we're all very open with each other; I don't necessarily want to throw my teammate under the bus (for lack of a better phrase, because I'm of the opinion that not discussing salaries as the norm was pushed by employers and only protects them) and transparently say that she told me what she makes, nor do I think that's a very good negotiating strategy.

I don't want to look for a new job because despite how it sounds, this is a wonderful company to work for and I truly enjoy my job. It's just... nobody/nothing is perfect, and salaries are definitely a point of contention. The people I work for can be very reasonable and they're very respectful, so I think if I carefully consider how to pitch this salary increase request I have a good shot.

&amp;#x200B;

*Bonus Question: I am by far better at communicating these points on paper. When communicating verbally, I'm not nearly as eloquent and I get visibly nervous when having serious talks about money. Is it inappropriate to outline my request in an email and then ask to meet with my boss to discuss?*",personalfinance

I'm currently living in a condo unit that has a home owners association. We have been experiencing issues with leaking in the top floor units and they have been looking for contractors to determine the problem. They have determined the entire parapet wall needs to be reconstructed. They are quoting us about 400,000 USD, which to me is insane but I'm not a contractor.

The issue is, our reserves are only about 90K, so they are talking about possibly issuing a special assessment to all 32 units that would be around 22,000$. Obviously this is a pretty big ask, especially as over 50% of our units are rentals.

I'm curious, and have no idea where to ask, but is this something that the building insurance would be able to cover? Or claim? Or is it possible they are passing the buck off to us?

t3_chkrq6,Is it wise to keep letting debts accumulate while I finish school?,"Hey everyone, so I'm a 29 year old single mom to a 3 year old, currently working two days a week, making around $400/mo to pay my car note. A family member agreed to pay the rest of my rent/bills while I attend an online coding bootcamp. The program is designed to be completed while working full-time, but because I have a 3 year old I found it difficult to actually find the time to do it, so I reduced my hours at work. This is my third attempt at schooling after 2 failed attempts at part-time CS grad school and working full time.

The main reason I chose a bootcamp is that my current job wasn't paying enough to cover my expenses even while working full-time, and Family Member was already helping me out. I was making around 20k/yr. Since then I've been approved for food benefits from the state and would have around $400/mo to put towards debt if I went back to work full time. Currently, my debts are accruing late fees, I'm getting letters about them going to collections, and my credit score is dropping. I also have nothing in savings and can't save anything unless I go back to work full-time.

I was hoping to buy a home in the next two years. My program will be done in November, but may take longer if I go back to work full time, and the program won't guarantee me a job if I take longer than 6 months to finish it (which just means they won't refund my money if I don't find a job in 6 months after graduation). Is it better to let debts go for now and focus on learning a new skill and getting a better paying job come November, or should I be trying to maintain my credit at all costs? Am I setting myself back further than I think if I let these debts sit until November? I started the program in May and my credit has already tanked just from these few months of living off credit cards and then not paying the bills. I have around $600 in credit card debt (both maxed now), 70k student loan debt (no payments due), 3k from my failed grad school attempt, 13k on the car and $100 in medical bills.",personalfinance

t3_chimq9,Commute from Nice Area or Live Close to Not So Nice Area (FL),"This might be a bit long so please bear with me.

I am a psychology student who accepted a paid internship in X County (one of very few slots with health insurance and benefits interns). X County is within a very rural area that are mostly houses and older people (average age is 55 years old). My stipend for the year is $15,600, but after graduation with my degree next May, my starting pay in my career can range from $55k-$65k. I decided to apartment search in County Y in a bigger city and managed to find a place that cost $994 a month. I knew that my internship stipend wouldn't be enough so I saved money from part time jobs and federal student loans refunds, in addition to using the refunds will on my internship (I have online classes while I intern). I know I can make it work with what I have for the next nine months financially, but one of my concerns is the commute. The commute from County Y to County X is 30 miles and vice versa. The path to get there is on a long state road (not a highway). My parents like my apartment choice, but they don't like the long commute from my apartment and insist that I live within the rural area to shave off my commute time. I know where they are coming from, but I like my future apartment in County Y and I like the living area surrounding it, and with even with the same budget I have in County X, I wouldn't live in a not so good area. And since I know this internship will end in 9 months, I wouldn't commute anymore. In addition, after my internship in County X, I was planning on getting a job in County Y. My career (not teaching) has a shortage and many counties in Florida are desparate for us to work with them. 

TL;DR So my question is is it worth commuting 30 miles one way to live in a nicer area or live closer to work and live in a not so nice area? For what it's worth, County Y is more diverse than County X. (I am a POC.)",personalfinance

I live with my dad and my grandparents, we are in the same business together. I joined this business just recently. 

So here goes:

House Value: $500,000

We took a Business Loan Against our House of $350,000. We have to still repay around $400,000 (includes Interest).

Monthly Payment for Business Loan: **$3400** (for the next 9.5 years)

**Car Loans**

We own 3 cars:

First Car: **$150** only one payment remaining

Second Car:  **$400**, 18 payments remaining

Third Car: **$200**, 24 payments remaining

**Other Debts/Expenses**

Monthly Expenses (Office Rent, Salaries, Utilities, Groceries, Car Maintenance, Business Expenses, Insurance etc.):  **$4000**

Credit Card Debt: $2,500

Owed in Back Taxes: $10,000

Pending Business Payments to Suppliers: $50,000 (can pay this in instalments, as these suppliers still want my business)

Loan Against Gold and Jewellery: $11,500 (after payment of which we will get our jewellery and gold back)

Owed to Non-Banking Loan Sharks (high interest): $4,000 - I want to pay this off asap.

So, total Non-debt money owed: **$78,000**

**SUMMARY**

**Monthly Debt Repayments: $4,000** 

**Monthly Expenses (Living and Business, Excluding Debt): $4,000**

**Credit Card Debt: $2,500**

**Owed in Back Taxes/Suppliers/Non-debt: $78,000 (of which I have 15% equity due to jewellery)**

**Monthly Income: $10,000 approx (goes up or down 10-15% depending on economy)**

We are under extreme pressure each month to make ends meet, so we are considering selling the house, and paying off our Business Loan of $350,000. That way, we save on interest we're meant to pay. Because we have paid so much interest in the past 2 years, we haven't been able to save or spend. I have learnt a lesson that one can never enjoy profits if they are paying high interest. Don't fall into the interest trap!

Once the business loan is paid off, we won't have the pressure to pay $3,400 every month. And considering our business income is $10,000, we can exercise some level of financial freedom, and for a change, take our profits home. The mental peace due to that is invaluable too.

Also, I have a chance to increase my business income from $10,000 to approx $15,000 per month, by infusing $3,000 into my business. So I need to fund that too, but that is not possible since we are not left with anything to invest after paying off our monthly payments, and no banks are willing to finance my business anymore as we are already 2 months late on our Business loan repayment.

Our plan is to sell off the house which is going at around $500,000 in the market. Pay off the 400k business loan, and use $50k to clear other dues and infuse our business with money.  The other $50k we will use as a downpayment of a new, smaller house, and the rest we will mortgage, monthly payments of that should be around $1500 per month, which we can easily manage because we have cleared our big debts. We believe that rather than paying $700-800 rent a month, why not spend that money on a house you can own instead. Sure, the new house is gonna be a small apartment in a location away from the city centre, but that's OK, an asset is an asset.

Does that sound like a plan? Or should I try to keep the house, thereby struggling every month to make payments, hardly saving, causing stress and anxiety to self.

Food: $400 average. We can spend as a little as $80/mo and as much as $800/ mo. My partner loves to eat out and will do so as often as the budget allows. Trying to reign this in. Huge variable month to month.

Insurance: $220 

Netflix/Hulu: $20

Cleaning/ Household: $20 (very small house, will likely go up with a larger home).

Clothing: $30 average (very rarely shop for clothing, can't stand it, usually will go for months without buying anything and then buy a bunch of things at once).

&amp;#x200B;

My concerns are we have absolutely terrible health/ dental insurance. We had a couple (relatively minor) health issues that cost $4k this year. I expect that it will be equally as bad next year. We will also likely have to start caring for an elderly relative (hence the need for a larger home) and that will increase our expenses.",personalfinance
t3_chhtzn,Deep in credit card debt and looking for the BEST course of action.,"Okay I’ll make this as simple as I can. I’ve racked up about $50,000 in credit card debt. This is spread over three Amex, two Visa, a Discover (originally opened for balance transfer), and a partridge in a pear tree.

I make around $100,000-$120,000 per year at the moment, which I realize is substantial. That been said, with my mortgage and other expenses, the $1200/month or so I’m paying to cover the minimum balances are sucking me dry, and those balances aren’t dropping. I don’t have enough cash on hand to simply pay off any individual card, and that would put me in a tough position with payments for other cards anyway. 

I’ve looked into debt consolidation companies, personal loans, debt-free payoff plans, and more. This has all just left me more confused. My credit score is around 650, and I don’t know what options this score would disqualify.

t3_chf6m6,Teacher Retirement Mess...,"Hey all! I've looked through the archives for an answer to my question but everything I've been stumbling across is pretty confusing. Finance... is not a strength of mine by any means. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, as the title states, I'm a teacher that has bounced around a couple of states over the last 9 years of my career. I know, probably not the best financial move but definitely a good one for personal reasons. I worked in Florida, Texas, and am now in Louisiana. From what I understand, Louisiana has a strong teacher retirement program whereas Texas does not. I hope that this will play in my favor. 

&amp;#x200B;

But anyway here's the issue. I have 5.5 years of service in Florida and retirement under the FRS investment plan. There is about 27k in that plan right now as I never got around to moving it. 

In Texas, I don't even know how much I have because their website is shitty and apparently been under construction for like two years now. I can call and find out which I am planning on doing this week but I'm guessing somewhere in the ballpark of about 10k. I put in three years of service in Texas.

I now have one year of service in the books here in Louisiana with absolutely zero intention of leaving the state or the profession. I'm also realizing that I need to get my shit together in terms of my finances. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question: What is the best move for me to make in regards to consolidating these accounts? I've read a lot about rolling over my previous retirement accounts into a Roth IRA but I don't know if that's actually the best move. And on top of that, I get the impression that the teacher retirement system in Louisiana is decent. I am extremely ignorant on these matters and I know that this is probably something that I'd really need to hire an advisor on but unfortunately the budget is tight right now and with a little one on the way, I figured I'd come in here and ask.",personalfinance

t3_chf2oj,Gave my dad money to invest when I was younger,"When I was 16, I got my first job and saved about $15,000.

My parents wanted to shelter my money from FAFSA, so I gave my dad that money in turn to invest.  He essentially just turned one of his portfolios, about 10 years old, into my mine, but he didn't do anything official.

I'm 19 now, and I'm about to finish college. My questions are:

How would he transfer me that account (would it count as a gift?)

What are the tax consequences (it is long-term for him, but if he transfers the account, is it short term for me)?

If it is long-term, I made $30,000 this year, so should I sell that portfolio when I get it so that I'll pay zero in long-term capital gains tax? I'm graduating in December, and I expect to make significantly more after graduating. 

If I should sell the account, what should I do with that money? I've already maxed out my Roth IRA for the last two years and have a small emergency fund.

""the earlier you start saving to secure your future, the cheaper it will be"""," So I'm 21, recently have become concerned about my complete and utter lack of financial literacy, so have been doing some reading. However, I read this in the paper today and am not sure If I understand what she is saying correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

""The earlier you start saving to secure your future, the cheaper it will be. Read that again, because it’s life-changing.

Say you want to amass a million dollars by age 65 so diligently invest each month and earn an average 8 per cent return…

* If you start at age 55, you will have to save nearly $5500 a month.
* If you start at 40, you will have to save far less at $1050, but
* If you start at age 20, you will only have to save $190.

What’s even more important to know about those numbers is that our poor, possibly quite literally, 55-year old has had to find $344,000 of his/her ultimate $1m. Meanwhile our enterprising 20-year old has personally parted with just $100,000.""

&amp;#x200B;

Is it saying that to accrue $1m by age 65, you need to invest less when you're younger because that money will have more time to accrue interest? Ie. is she saying, if you invest $190 with an 8% return for 45 years, this will = $1m? And ultimately, because of the extra time the money has had to accrue interest, the 20 year old only needed to put $100,000 in to get the same amount of money? 

Also, really bleedingly obvious to everyone (but literally I've never learnt anything about money so I am super naive) but what is she investing in? In shares or something? In an account?",personalfinance

t3_chbfam,Figuring out whether to buy or rent a house was complicated. Am I the only one?,"Hello PF!

I recently had to figure out whether I would rent or buy a home. 

I worked through a few popular tools including the Khan Academy spreadsheet (http://www.khanacademy.org/downloads/buyrent.xls) and the NYTimes Rent vs Buy calculator (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html). 

I thought they were useful but I still struggled to get to ""an answer"", especially an answer I felt confident about.

For one, it took me a while to figure out how to think about housing appreciation, portfolio return and inflation. Those variables are easily glossed over, but can swing the results significantly! Also in Canada (where I'm based), mortgage rates are variable which adds another layer of complexity.

I didn't fully ""trust"" my results, mainly because of tax. Whereas the capital gain on your principal residence is largely tax-free, stocks and bonds are subject to tax on interest and capital gains which drags down returns -- I had to figure out how to take that into account.

I also had to weigh in other considerations, such as how much I valued the lifestyle benefits of renting vs bunting. 

Did anyone else struggle in similar ways?

I'm thinking about taking everything I've learned and turning it into a more beginner-friendly guide that walks through each input one-by-one. 

For example, one step might ask you go to Zillow to find a few houses you'd consider buying. Another step might show you historical housing appreciation so you have a basis for thinking through what rate to plug into the model. 

What has been your own experience figuring out the rent vs buy decision? Any thoughts on a more beginner-friendly guide or calculator?",personalfinance

t3_cherga,"Extremely burnt out from working 2 jobs, wanting to quit but unsure of financial stability.","I live in Canada, over the past two years I have been working 2 jobs. One job is a recurring seasonal job over a period of six months making $20/hr with benefits (Mid April - Mid October) at 40 hours a week. The other is part-time with hours varying between 20 and 40 hours a week at $25/hr with no benefits. I also have to mention that neither of these jobs include paid vacation or holidays. 

My Part time job is all year round and I need to work both in order to keep this job to make payments over the winter time. I have been absolutely killing myself so far this summer at an average of 65 hours a week. I barely have time to see my fiancée or family, sleep is bare minimum and I believe I’m on the break of a nervous breakdown, I dread going in to work everyday.

I’m pretty inexperienced with finances as I have just moved out with my fiancée a year ago and feel that I still have a lot to learn spending and budgeting wise (I’ve lived on my own once during school for a year but I had financial support at the time).

I don’t know how much longer I can continue working two jobs, I had to leave work early last week on two different days due to mental health/exhaustion.

My fiancée makes decent money at $18/hr, which comes to about $1,100 bi-weekly. She also has benefits that she pays towards taken from her pay. I have talked to her about me leaving one of my jobs and she said she would support me no matter what, as I did for her when she was having issues work wise.

Here is a list of our expenses per month;

Rent - $800
Car Payment - $323
Car Insurance- $170
Groceries - $200
Internet - $90
Phone Payment - $95
Student Loans - $77
Gym Membership - $30
Apple Music - $17

I’m just wondering if I were to quit a job, which one would you recommend? Would we be able to afford this lifestyle comfortably if I were to leave one of my jobs?

I should mention that my part time job has offered me 30-40 hours a week guaranteed starting this October. If I work this for a few years there is a chance I get on full time which would include benefits, vacation and sick days.

It's a web of self-sustaining bad decisions, it's a cycle that's very hard to break but has a very predictable structure. Subconscious reasoning: I hate my life, myself, and want to be anyone, anything else. This existential pain is easily ignored with virtual environments, made more immersive through mind-altering substances, so that real life may be easily forgotten. Logical conclusion: change my life so that I like it, change self so that I like me. Harder in practice than in theory.!&lt;
      * &gt;!Has led to poor health, self-neglect, neglect of beloved pets, manipulative behavior, neglect of family, isolation, disgusting and dilapidated living conditions, and more self-sabotage. Mind automatically jumps to seeking more escapist behavior, like clockwork. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Education**

* &gt;!Started as engineering major in state-backed community college. !&lt;
   * &gt;!Was doing great; worked out to get into the best shape of my life, diligently studying led to straight A's for several semesters, had a great Pell Grant, didn't need to work thanks to generosity and hospitality of US-based Mom, life was good, minus the horrible lack of girlfriends - but that isn't important to me anymore.!&lt;
   * &gt;!Had already completed several credits in a different major at the same institution about a decade earlier, caused problems with SAP.

   * &gt;!Mother suffered traumatic injury leaving her bedbound in a cast for almost a year!&lt;
      * &gt;!I took care of her. It was OK at first, and I was happy to. More toxicity. Started being treated as something akin to a servant and emotional surrogate of a husband-figure. Mother demanded constant attention. Threw fits if I did not immediately respond to even the smallest of commands. Daily screaming, but it's always been like that with her. Didn't even realize relationships with parents could be different until I left the country and saw for myself. There was lots of gaslighting. I'm not gonna get into it unless some of you want to know more. !&lt;
   * &gt;!Good decisions stopped happening as I tried to cope with the accumulating stress and walking-on-eggshells thing. Started slowly but surely embracing my vices. Start of a downward academic spiral. GPA of 3.7 is now a 1.98!&lt;
   * &gt;!Turned out I needed to continue taking courses at this community college for another two years in order to get my associates degree, but I had too many credits and no financial aid.!&lt;
      * &gt;!If I switched majors to General Studies, would only need to retake Chem 2. Currently doing that, so I have something to show for my effort instead of nothing at all, even though it's basically as useful as a high school diploma. Will hopefully graduate soon.!&lt;
   * &gt;!ACL reconstruction surgery!&lt;
      * &gt;!Knee was a ticking time bomb, was informed last January that I seriously needed surgery. Tried to tough it out to stay in the semester and just get it done over the summer. Messed my knee up, had to have the surgery anyway after semester midpoint, the deadline where you can still withdraw from classes. Had to initiate emergency withdrawal. My academic record must look extremely good by now.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Employment**

* &gt;!I can't seem to be able to hold any job longer than a few months. I never get an explanation why I get laid off or why I stop showing up on the schedule. Turns out begging for your job is totally pointless, too. I think it's my personality and my incredible ability to ruin any and all of my plans by somehow always being tardy through random coincidence or secretly indulging in addiction. The tardiness is a severe problem that I seem incapable of dealing with properly, and it is the primary cause for 50% of my life's stress and anxiety.!&lt;
* &gt;!I've had multiple jobs at once, many times. I don't ever want to do that again unless the pay is amazing.!&lt;
* &gt;!I've had ideas that have gotten others quite wealthy, especially if I was already working for them. I never saw a dime.!&lt;
* &gt;!Retail makes me sick to the stomach, as it really is just the art of lying and manipulating. I don't want to be good at it, I've had enough of that in my life.!&lt;
* &gt;!I can't stand having a boss.!&lt;
   * &gt;!After 15 years of worthless entry-level and sub-management positions across several countries and industries with long periods of undocumented unemployment between each job, resume is generally considered either overqualified or dismissed outright.!&lt;
   * &gt;!The idea of being doomed to making a business owner slightly wealthier with my work, with my only incentive being avoiding homelessness for another month, feels like a fate worse than death. I think my only salvation is to become my own boss somehow. Too many business ideas, not enough capital, not enough know-how, not enough action. !&lt;

# The Main Situation: Self-Exile in Default

* Dual citizen, USA and EU.
* No USA assets.
* No USA family.
* No USA friends.
* Insignificant income.

&amp;#x200B;

I took out the loans so I could get by, get out of my Mom's, afford security deposits, rent, groceries, gasoline, insurance. I needed to buy time on borrowed money to find a job and study. Got the jobs, ended up losing them with little to no explanation, per the norm, a month or two later. The money was terrible, but enough. Financial aid was long-gone, after which I turned to both sub- and unsubsidized Stafford loans (20k, and I'm not getting it anymore after my Academic Improvement Plan was tossed due to administrative withdrawal from absences. Yep, vices were being indulged).

So, I turned to private student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Sallie Mae's loaned me $12500. I spent some of the money wisely, the rest poorly, not only against my better judgement but also unintentionally. I'm bad with wealth management and budgeting, but I really want to learn. It's hard to understand all of the jargon and percentages involved.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I have gathered, if I just left the country and never came back, I could just forget all about my student debt here and live my other life. I would probably even get away with it.

The only negative repercussions I can see, based on my research, are:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Absurd**

* &gt;!""Student Debt 'Bounty Hunters'""!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Worrying**

* &gt;!Running away with Uncle Sam's money!&lt;
   * &gt;!Definitely do not want to do this. I will do an IBR and go for insolvency eventually, if I can't pay off my debt. It's borrowed money. I don't want it over my shoulders.!&lt;
* &gt;!The consequences of ever having to need to return to the USA after self-exile. Although I have lived a far happier life outside of the States, the USA has several distinct advantages for its citizens:!&lt;
   * &gt;!I think it's easier to start a business here!&lt;
   * &gt;!I think another world war is going to happen within six years, so I'd like to have the ability to hide behind USA's nuclear arsenal and have access to a firearm. !&lt;
   * &gt;!If I manage to get a bachelor's degree, I would like to attempt getting into Officer school for the Navy or Air Force, in order to give me experience, a way to eliminate some of my debt, learn structure and discipline, and effective fitness maintenance skills. !&lt;
      * &gt;!I've experienced far worse things than boot camp and I'm used to being shouted at  and interrupted constantly. However, this sort of shouting would be elementally different from the sort I'm used to, and I believe it'd be far less difficult to tolerate. It wouldn't seem as pointless, even if I didn't understand the order. I'd just have to do what I'm told to do - this seems like a relief. !&lt;
      * &gt;!This would also only be after I have fully left my addiction in the past. It's really just the games now, the root of it all. If I fix my life, I don't think I would be inclined to rely on my escapist vices outside of habit, which can be conquered through at least 25 days of repetitive proactive behavior.!&lt;
* &gt;!Having to live ""on the run""!&lt;
   * &gt;!No social media!&lt;
      * &gt;!Honestly, this seems more a positive than a negative. I'm tired of baby pictures, other people boasting about extravagant vacations, and professional accomplishments, and Instagram narcissists that get wealthy because of the way their ass is shaped and presented.!&lt;
* &gt;!Moving every time collection agencies find me!&lt;
   * &gt;!Not sure why I'd even have to do this in the first place, explanations are scarce or nonexistant!&lt;
* &gt;!Avoiding getting served in person would be more feasible, but can't the SOL just be renewed every ten years by debt acquisition companies?!&lt;
* &gt;!I don't want to live on the run, I'm not a criminal.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

and **The Irrelevant**

* &gt;!Ruined credit score.!&lt;
   * &gt;!Only applies in the USA.!&lt;
* &gt;!Accruing debt and compounded interest!&lt;
   * &gt;!Seems to only apply in the USA!&lt;
      * &gt;!I've seen mention of some sort of agreements the USA has with the EU, something called MARV or MARD, where I understand the USA could just extradite you back into its loving embrace or seamlessly transfer the debt to an EU collections agency. If anyone has information about this or something similar, it is welcome.!&lt;
* &gt;!Harrassment of family members and friends in the States!&lt;
   * &gt;!Not Applicable, mother recently retired to the motherland.!&lt;
   * &gt;!Dad's been dead since I was 12, but he wasn't really around anyway.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Rationale:**

&gt;Not only have I already experienced it, but I know I would have absolutely no qualms about never returning to the States. However, I am much more mature now and hopefully wiser than before, and I realize now that it was never the country that I despised, but rather the town where I grew up. I know I could find happiness in the USA, too. But the supersaturated media and obnoxiously manipulative mega-marketing does get quite old, and it's really hard to beat free healthcare and higher education. The whole concept of a debt-based economy sounds horribly plutocratic to me, as well. And Trump's been hiring businesspeople into positions of political power, which is very worrying, but honestly it's kind of always been like that, just not so direct. The EU seems to primarily have issues with militant nationalism and Islamic refugees, for the most part, but I am likely misinformed.

# I don't want to default on my debt.

The idea to run away from it is extremely tempting. I always thought I could just pay the debt off no problems with an engineering degree. It doesn't look like that's going to happen now, because apparently this chaotic and creative mind of mine will have to be happy stocking shelves for a living (that's one of the top careers for my degree). I know I can amount to so much more, but the lack of money I've imposed on myself is holding me back. My personal issues are holding me back. All the cards are stacked against me, which is infuriating. I want to rebel against destiny, and force my own future into existence. I could do that with papers proving my capabilities, and this isn't one of them.

But I borrowed that damn money, it wasn't mine to begin with, and it doesn't sit right with me. It's against my fundamental ideology.I've this very specific gut feeling that going through with this would end up severely biting me in the ass down the road. I've been through enough to recognize this particular gut feeling, and it's usually been proven to have been correct, even if I couldn't explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just really don't know what else I can do. I can go to work, but that won't last, and it won't be for a living wage. I can try to educate myself more to get a job I could truly excel in, but I've made it almost impossible  to do so without further loans, not to mention my convoluted transcript.

t3_chj2wd,I'm trying to amend my 2017 tax return and I'm so overwhlemed right now,"I first realized several months ago that I had to report my online publishing work on taxes. In 2017, I was 16, just fullfilling my hobby and it never crossed my mind that that the $1500-$2000 I earned over the year had to be reported.

Now, 18 year old me is trying to fix my mistake. But week after week, I keep putting it off because everytime I start, after several hours in, I'm just overwhelmed with so many different documents I have to fill out, jargon I have no idea how to decipher and I'm just so, so, so lost. My parents can't help at all.

Gods of finance, I promise to always report my taxes correctly from now for the rest of my life on if I can get this over with now.

I submitted with TurboTax in 2017. When I try to amend, it told me to download the ""right version of TurboTax"" but when I complete it, it says I can't efile and I have to mail it. Can I just print off the efile PDF and send that? And the 1040x...I don't know how to fill it.

t3_chd2vh,Help with a fraud claim from a gas station,"I need some advice regarding a fraud claim we are trying to make with both CitiBank and a Love's gas station. We are being charged over $400.00 for diesel, when neither of us have vehicles that take diesel.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I are PCSing and started a PPM/DITY (whatever they call it now) move last Thursday and stopped at a Love's to top off our gas and weigh the vehicles full at the start of our trip. My husband used the government travel credit card to fill up my car (a Mazda3), and it only needed a few unleaded gallons (less than 4). He was not asked for a zip code or pin, nor was he offered a receipt. He didn't think anything of it since it was a small charge and his mind was on our long day of driving. I sat at the pump for at least 10 minutes after he hung this pump back up.

&amp;#x200B;

 He then moved to another pump to fill up his car (a Mazda CX-5) using the government travel card, and it was denied. He tried a few times, thinking that he may have entered the wrong zip code (which it did ask for this time) because again, we were moving. He ended up using our personal card to top himself off, and then went inside to grab something to drink, paying with the personal card again. I was still sitting in my car at the original pump this entire time, and no one took the pump off the hook to continue filling.

&amp;#x200B;

When he came back out, we both drove to the CAT scales to weigh the vehicles. He went in to pay with our personal card and get the weigh tickets, then we started our drive. Sometime between the gas station and our destination, he got a call from Citi about a potential fraudulent charge at the Love's. He agreed that it was fraudulent because we didn't spend more than $75.00 between the gas, snacks and scales (5 different charges on 2 cards). They told him they would file it if the charge posted.

&amp;#x200B;

Come Tuesday, we found out that the charge did post and we are on the hook for the full amount. We have contacted the Love's station, Love's corporate and Citi. Love's furnished us with a receipt showing that ""we"" paid for over 130 gallons of diesel. The Love's manager claims he doesn't have surveillance to prove that we didn't pull up in a with a ton of containers or fill up a bunch of other cars, but we do have proof that we were driving personally owned vehicles from the CAT scales. We even asked if he would be agreeable to us paying for a full tank of unleaded gas per the rate at that time, but he said no. Corporate said it is up to the manager to authorize the refund. Citi needs a copy of the receipt to file fraud, but we obviously don't have a copy of the original one as the pump didn't give my husband the option to print.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a lot of money? No, but I am jobless right now because of the PCS and moving is expensive regardless of the dislocation allowance and per diem. We could really use that money to help tide us over until I can find a job near the new duty station. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea of what we can do? We are still compiling a list of evidence to prove we couldn't have made that purchase, but it is kind of weak: We don't own vehicles that take diesel, a diesel pump wouldn't even fit in either of our cars, we have proof of the cars weighed at the scales, the amount that our cars weighed is reasonable for full cars with unleaded gas not diesel, my car would have broken down if we filled the entire thing with diesel, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband thinks it's possible that Citi issued two cards with the same number (but that doesn't make sense to me), but I wonder if they had a system glitch; if a trucker was filling up his semi at the same time, maybe he only got charged about $15.00 for 3 gallons of unleaded.",personalfinance

I got a copy of my credit report a few days ago and It showed I had an account in collections. I had a medical bill in collections over a year ago (about 198$) that I paid in full immediately so I went through my files and found the letter from them (where I also had written the date that I paid it over the phone) so I could contact them to findout why it said I still had an open account. Logged onto their website with the info from that letter and it shows where I paid the other but is showing an additional 505$ balance from a different date that I was unaware of. No letters, phone calls, nothing. It's been there tanking my credit with no contact about it whatsoever. 

I Called the collection ageny and told them this to which they replied they sent me one letter over the course if the past 16 months and tried to call me several times-I told them I never got a letter or voicemail and they said they don't leave voicemails and just get trying to get me to pay it in full completely and they would do me the service if removing it from my credit, and saying it was my fault for not answering their calls and overall being extremely rude and refusing to let me speak to someone above them (called twice, talked to 2 different people). 1st- what company doesn't leave voicemails for a callback!? Especially when I supposedly owe them money. Also, Who calls back every missed number that calls them but doesn't leave a message? Not me- I get constant spam calls! And 2nd, thy sent ONE letter over a 16 month period!? They kept just repeating that they would accept my payment today. Pissed off, I refused to pay and hung up. 

I've since Contacted my insurance to make sure I had a claim for that date of service and my Dr to ensure it was something from them that they turned in-(extensive medical issues, tons of visits/procedures so it's hard to keep track especially that long ago) to which they are telling me they do NOT have and claims for that date, show nothing they've sent to collections for me, nor is that even the collection company they even use! This has happened over the course of several days, with about a million different phone calls trying to get to the bottom of this. 

I have no idea where to go from here- how can it be a scam if it is showing up on my credit report? But how can it exist if my dr doesn't use them or have a claim on file? No idea who to call or what to do. Half venting and half begging for help- anyone with any ideas I'd appreciate so much!

t3_chbs9w,High interest checking account paying decent cash back credit card.,"I'm 20 years old and grew up in a financially mismanaged household so perhaps this is a dumb question but I'm looking for verification here:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say I qualify and open up a high interest checking account (cash management account) such as a SoFi Money account which offers a 2.25% APY and allows you to write checks. I get paid once at month on the first, so I have my job direct deposit a portion of my paycheck into the account each month.  


I then qualify and open up a decent credit card such as the Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card which offers a cashback of 3% in your chosen category and 1% on everything else. I use the credit card the entire month for most of my necessary purchases (gas, food, ect) and pay it off in full every month using the SoFi Money account.  


Am I correct in assuming that the SoFi account will accrue average daily interest (paid out at the end of the month) and I'll also be gaining the cash back points from using the credit card? Is this wise and is this what most people do?  


TLDR: Do most people have a high interest checking/savings account which they collect daily interest on and just charge stuff to a everyday cash back credit card to maximize interest potential?",personalfinance

Up until we filed the paperwork to close the account – every distributed penny from the account was for a legitimate medical purpose.  Between the time that we used the remaining money in the account and filed the paperwork for account closure, the account earned one cent of interest. We have not received notice that the account was officially closed, but instead received a check for $0.01. 

So, I know this is a trivial amount of money – really I’d just like to rip the thing up and move on. But my fear is that this account won’t be fully closed until this remaining balance is handled.  

1. If this is cashed in our checking account, is there a tax penalty associated with it because the distribution is not for a legitimate medical purpose? 

2. If this is cashed in my HSA (like a rollover, I guess), does that count against our contribution limit for the year? (Side note: I currently have it set up through my employer to max out the HSA contribution).

Shes 70, and she still works as a nurse, however very little more than the minimums are being paid. She overextended bad when she bought her condo.

I dont know if theres much room for a HELOC, and besides she probably wont get approved as her balances are maxed and her FICO is in low 600s. 

I found out she has a small life insurance policy that shes had for 10+ years. I decided to get into the terms. She has about 11k in cash. There would be no fee to take it out as shes over 6 years vested now. The policy lets her take a loan out, or a partial surrender. 

I couldn't find much info regarding details on these two options however. If she takes a loan, is it subject to 2019 taxes as income? Also, when she pays interest on this loan, is it to herself similar to a 401k loan? 

What about just claiming like 10k of the 11k in cash as a partial surrender. I read this wont close the policy like a full surrender would. Is there any downside to doing this? Is it subject to taxes? 

I just ask because between fed and state shes at 30% tax brackets, so trying to avoid as much damage possible. 

The other route is 401k, as she had about 150k in it, market may be facing a recession in a few years, so it may be better to just take money out of that. I know taxes come in though.  I don't think she can get a 401k loan at 70, so it would just be a lump sum.",personalfinance

t3_chi839,Sister owes a bunch of taxes on wrongful death settlement,"My half-sister's father died in a jail fire in 2002. She was 3 years old at the time. His family sued the state and the county and won a total of $400,000. This was split among his children and my sister received a total of $179,000. She had to wait until she was 18 to receive the money and went to the courthouse to pick it up on her birthday. It's been about 2 years since she received her settlement and recently she found out from the IRS that she owes quite a bit of money for unpaid taxes and late fees on the money since 2002. How ""recently"" she actually found out about it I am unsure of. The IRS is going after her at work, contacting her employer, garnishing her wages, and her credit score has dropped from 750 to &lt;500 in one day. When I asked her about how much she owes in taxes, where the money was while she was underage, and why the taxes weren't being paid on it she told me to ask our mom. My mom is notoriously irresponsible with money. She took my inheritance from my grandfather when I was a minor and bought a plot of land with it, never paid the taxes, and the county took possession of the land. So I never saw my inheritance from my grandfather. 


After she received her money she put nearly all of it into a Roth-IRA account and does not have access to it, which is why she cannot afford to pay the taxes on it. Also, if it's even worth mentioning, when my sister first got the money, my wife and I urged her to get a financial adviser and my mom convinced her not to. I believe she now has a financial adviser but from what she's told me, it's all very confusing and my mom still has a bit of emotional control over her regarding what to do with the money because my sister is still so young and still lives with her. 


My main question is: in the event a minor receives a settlement, who is responsible for that money before the minor turns 18 and do taxes need to be paid by the responsible party every year? Was my mom responsible for the taxes each year until my sister turned 18? Could this potentially be a legal issue as much as it is a personal finance issue?",personalfinance
t3_chb5fj,401k rollover money deposited into wrong type of IRA,"I left my job in 2018. A couple of months ago, I decided to go ahead with my rollover. I had around ~$10,000 in my 401k account -- $6,500 was pre-tax funds and $3,500 was Roth funds. I was prepared to reach out to the HR admin at my old position, but when I logged into Principal (where my 401k was), they gave the option to complete the rollover online. There were a few options of how to do it. One was to have the check sent to me written to my IRAs with Fidelity OR a wire transfer. They stated the wire transfer would be done in 2-3 business days, while the check would take 10-15 business days. I was going out of the country in a couple of weeks so to make it faster, I went with the wire transfer. 

When completing the wire transfer form, I had to do it two times -- for pre-tax funds and Roth funds. I realized when filling it out that the account information from Fidelity (where my IRAs are) for the wire transfer were the same. I thought that was weird, but assumed the information from Principal would have all the details. 

Well, it didnt. For some reason when Fidelity received the $10,000 sum, they deposited it all into my Roth IRA. I realize this is my fault -- I should have not done the wire transfer, should have realized there was going to be an issue and / or entered the information in incorrectly. I called Fidelity to correct and they said they need letters from Principal specifying the total amount of each account and how to correctly deposit it. I then need to upload that to my Fidelity account and then give them a call. They would not do it based on the information I provided. The information that I could pull from Principal did not specify Roth vs pre-tax funds. You would not believe how difficult this has been. I have called Principal 3x with no resolution. They kept saying they could do it and then sending me a letter through snail mail stating that my 401k balance was n/a. Turns out they are not allowed to release info to me due to the type of contract they have (?) with my old employer. I have been communicating with my old employer, but the information they are providing again is not what I need. This is still proving to be difficult and I do not have high hopes with what Principal will be able to provide. 

I cannot be the only person this has happened to. Does anyone have any experience with getting this corrected?

The problem lies in that my father made an absurd amount of money last year (~$166,000 CAD), but due to a variety of reasons, the greatest of which being his unemployment, he has nothing to show for his earnings and is instead in massive debt. My parents never planned to pay for my schooling as it is, but after submitting my application for financial aid, I was estimated to receive $0. I am now left wondering exactly what to do and how I'll be able to pay for my schooling, since my family's situation doesn't seem to be getting better anytime soon and I simply do not have the savings yet to pay my tuition. 

Any and all advice would be appreciated. I am at a loss for what to do next.",personalfinance

The remaining 15% is spread out between small/large company funds, small/large company indexes, international fund, and a REIT fund. Currently my average cost per $1000 is about $3.7. If I rebalance the 2050 fund into my other investments I can drop that to about $3.4 per $1000, but obviously I would need to be more hands on with my investments.

t3_chhvct,"Recent college graduate; need some help/advice/feedback creating a budget, saving, and (possibly) investing.","Hello, I recently graduated college and got my first big-boy job and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed with everything. I'll list what I have going on now, and if anyone has any feedback or advice for me, I'd really appreciate it!

**Income and Current Savings**

After I graduated, I accepted a job at *generic American company* where I currently make ~$70,000 / year before tax. After tax, my income is broken down as follows (amounts are approximate):

* 15% to Roth 401(k), with a 6% company match: ~$1,000 / month
* 20% to savings account: ~$600 / month
* Rest to checking account: ~$2,400 / month

As for savings, I have approximately ~$20,000 saved up from my previous job(s) that's currently sitting in a savings account at my bank (I think earning less than 1% interest).

**Current Expenses**

I moved back in with my parents after college, so my monthly expenses right now are relatively low. I am currently still on my mother's health insurance (I'm younger than 26), so I'm not including health insurance costs here.

* Car insurance: ~$200
* Gas for car: ~$60-70
* Phone: $40
* Spotify Premium: $10
* Xbox LIVE: $5

Total: ~$350

Surplus: ~$2,000

**Current Debt**

I was very fortunate to graduate college with no student debt, so I'm good on that front. The only other debt is $500 in credit card debt; I have my credit card set up to automatically pay the full outstanding balance at the end of each month, so that's taken care of (my credit score is currently ~750). I really only use my credit card for gasoline and the odd internet purchase.

**What I Want to Do**

First, get my own apartment (I will be living alone). After doing some research, here's what I think a hypothetical monthly breakdown for a 1-bedroom apartment would look like in my area. Feedback in this area is much appreciated! I'd like to know what I'm getting in to...

* Rent: $900
* Food: $300
* Water: $50
* Electricity: $80
* Internet: $80
* Toiletries/personal hygiene: ~$50

Do I need renter's insurance? How much would that be a month?

I'll also need to buy my own furniture; I currently have my own bed &amp; nightstand, desk, TV stand, and dresser. Really, I only *need* a couch and a dining room table &amp; chairs - maybe a one-time purchase of ~$2,500?

Second, save for retirement and a rainy day fund. I think I'm on the right track here.

Third, get a new-ish car. I'm thinking something in the $10,000 to $20,000 range, max 3/4 years old. I'm planning to gift my current car to either my dad or sisters, so I won't get anything from selling it.

Fourth, invest. I already have a Vanguard brokerage account set up, but I've been too scared/overwhelmed to do anything with it yet.

Fifth (10 to 20 years down the line), buy a house.

**Conclusion**

Typing it all out actually cleared some things up for me, so that's good. I would still like some feedback/criticism on what I can do better, etc. Main goal right now is to save and/or invest enough so that if some emergency happens, I won't be left scrambling for cash.

Thanks for reading and have a great day!

I’m not even asking for a huge loan amount my budget is 8k for a two year loan.

I stopped at a couple shitty basically buy here pay here places and the interest rates make me vomit.

t3_chhl8s,Can I get detailed credit card statements if accounts have been charged off?,"Long story short almost 2 years ago I went through a nasty divorce, job loss, and health crisis including hospitalization. 

I was unable to pay for quite a few credit cards and a personal loan before I recovered and all accounts have been charged off and sent to collections.  This includes Discover Card, Chase Card, Amex, Boa credit card, and a credit union unsecured loan.

Before the charge offs I was able to call each account and get the account balance at the time of separation and other info such as the current balance at the time and interest rates.  Problem is all of these were via phone and written down by me and given to lawyers with no paperwork to back it up.

Well my dilemma is in a few weeks I am due in family court (NC) for ""equitable distribution of assets and liabilities"" and have a court order to provide all paperwork to back everything up.  Honestly I have just stuck my head in the sand and tried not to think about it which is stupid I know I know!

I don't have that paperwork and am afraid the credit card companies will not provide anything since the accounts are in collections.

Do I have any leverage to get these records?

To boot I have disputes put out about EVERYTHING to try to clean up my credit and slowly things are falling off my credit as dispute fail to be acknowledged properly.  I am using creditrepair.com and paying the $130 a month plan (biggest plan) to try to get myself out from a 520 credit score.

As stated in the post I am a 17 year old. I got into a car accident and the insurance is likely going to be too expensive for my dad to afford if the fault isn’t put on the person who hit me. 

I didn’t go into much detail in that post about why exactly I can’t work, so I’ll do that here instead. My dad is on social security due to the passing of my mother a few years ago and his inability to work and raise my brothers and I at the same time, so he chose to take out social security for what he has worked in exchange for the ability to raise us.

Because of him being on social security, I will not be able to get a job until I graduate high school, which I now have one year left of. Me getting a job would result in money being taken away from his social security and therefore making the whole effort of me working completely pointless.

Long story: I made a ton of very bad financial decisions when I was 18-19, right around 4 years ago. I got a bunch of credit cards, saw them as free money, ended up maxing them out, and was too ashamed of my mistakes to bring them up. I ended up finding the love of my life, and fast forward to present, we have a kid and bills and jobs but I’ve still been carrying that weight of credit card debt ever since. For the most part, I’ve been good with the minimum payments, but over the past year my job had some fluctuating paychecks, making it pretty hard to get to bills and paying off debt at the same time. As my fiancée and I are planning to get married, we were going through a mass consolidation of our finances when I revealed I had this debt. It was a pretty big deal of course, both emotionally and financially, but now we’ve been working together as opposed to working separate on getting all this debt paid down. 

We expect my $1500 in CC debt to be paid in full by September, as well as working on a medical bill amounting to around $830. On both my credit accounts, I have payments late 30-60 days and it’s negatively affecting my score. Now that I feel confident enough to actually face this debt head on and we’ve already made good headway on it, I’m wondering if there’s any way to get these negative remarks taken off my record by the time I pay down all the debt?

t3_chgvbu,Potential Geico Scam - Be Wary Everyone.,"Interesting scam I think.  Got a Geico sms text to my Apple Watch, not my phone, or iPad or any other device, just to my watch.  


“Geico Policy: An underwriter will be calling you soon at this number to discuss your policy.  Please answer if available to do so”

iPhone immediately rings with an unknown 800 number.  I have a Geico policy so I answered thinking the whole time this must be an elaborate scam.

A pleasant female voice says “Thank you for being such a good customer this last 9 years, we’d like to offer you a program that wasn’t available when you first got your policy, I just need some information from you and we can look it up.  Don’t worry, we’ll only do a soft credit pull.”  

I respond that I will think about it and call in the morning (It’s 8:30pm) and she says “It will only take a few moments”
I respond that I will think about it and call in the morning again and she says “Okay, thank you for your time, I’ll send you an email with a link to our website.”
Get the email, it’s from Underwriting1 and it looks so fake.  No Geico branding other than the word and just a brief paragraph about a new deal to save me money with an 877 number to call.  

Couple flags.

1.	She never introduced herself.

2.	She never called me by name at all or referenced any personal information they would have.

3.	I’ve only had Geico for about 6 years.

4.	Only my Apple Watch got the original text, Geico wouldn’t even have that number on file as the Watch number isn’t technically an active number you can directly call.

5.	The 877 number is not in any of the Geico contact numbers I have online or in the Geico app.


So what do you think?  Full on scam?  I’ll be calling Geico in the morning just to verify.",personalfinance
t3_chgvbn,FHA Streamline Refi - downside?,"Any info on an FHA Streamline loan?  Our mortgage company came to us with something that seems to be too good to be true.  

We purchased a new build in 2017 with an FHA loan for $282K.  Our monthly payment (piti) is currently $1963 and our rate is 3.75%.  

Freedom Mortgage called (because I inquired about FHA streamline based on an insert that came with our statement) to talk about this.  

We’ve been approved to refi 3.25% (not a huge reduction I guess).  If we refi with the same terms (28 years to go), it’ll reduce our payment to $1874 and save is about $24K over the life of the loan.  

Our FHA upfront MIP payment from the first loan will be refunded to us on a prorated basis.  The new upfront payment will be rolled into the new mortgage.  The bank is paying all fees.  

We will end up skipping one mortgage payment.  And only need to bring $600  to close to cover escrow due to the missed mortgage payment.  


This all seems to good to be true so I’m skeptical.  In terms of monthly payments, I’m skipping a payment, only need to take escrow to close (so $1300 is staying in my pocket),  monthly PITI is reduced by nearly $100, and  I save $24K over the life of the loan.  Now I realize I’m wrapping the new FHA upfront MIP into the loan so my balance will end up being higher, but I think this saves me money long term.  Is there a downside to this? 

In case it matters, wife and I gross ~$170k per year, I’m the only one on the current mortgage.  Credit isn’t stellar (650ish for both of us). High DTI ratio even with our salary - thanks student loans and credit cards.  We live in Ohio.",personalfinance

I'm changing careers from teacher to school psychologist. They did not approve my PLUS loan and say I need a qualified cosigner to get it. 4 relatives and 2 friends have already tried to cosign and they were not approved. I desperate now.

I have gained a lot from this community and decided to be part of the conversation and bring up good financial talking points that could benefit other people.   


Here it goes:  
I am thinking of a opening a high yield savings account. I was researching different banks, and I came across two banks that offered higher APY's:  Wealthfront and Betterment (I know they are technically brokerages as opposed to banks).  
My though process in regards to selecting a high yield savings account was to simply see which out of the banks (and brokerages) offered the best rate, were FDIC insured, had a 1 dollar minimum investment, and had unlimited transfers.   
Is there anything I should know that would lead me to go to a bank over a brokerage? And more broadly, is there anything I should know about high yield saving accounts? Is my though process off target??  
Lastly, for example, American Express National Bank offers a 2.10% APY.  Why would anybody go to that bank if Wealthfront and Betterment offer higher yields?",personalfinance

t3_b2nc2f,[meta] Think of the comments as an inverted Uber rating. (click to find out what this means),"Since two or three times a week we end up removing a few threads on why everyone keeps suggesting breakups, rather than micromanage the community, we figured this post would be prudent:

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all ""A+++ WOULD RIDE AGAIN."" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

Well, think of /r/relationship_advice comments as much the same, only inverted. Two things to always keep in mind:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are insurmountable (or just exceedingly difficult to deal with). 

**The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened—your account—with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark,** meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like ""dump"" and ""lawyer up."" 

The _key_ is that the number of serious comments telling you to _consider an alternative to breaking up_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to continuing what you've got going. Examples:

* Let's say you're asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag, and that behavior is so bad, the flag's not so much dyed red as it is _literally bleeding._ Nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run. Cool; **Zero Stars.** Shoot I might even lock the thread and tell you it's above our paygrade.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the **three to four stars territory.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? Probably **four to five stars.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

This applies to platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic either, but for the sake of not needing a TLDR for the TLDR, I'm avoiding listing every single condition. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude, so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of ""break up with them."" If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you should definitely consider giving that 25% a chance.

You get the drift? 

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to break up. It's a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than breaking up, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

t3_chm8zl,How do I repay my boyfriend for his kindness?,"Throwaway because I don't want him to see this 

My boyfriend (29) and I (25F) have been dating around 6 months. I go to school full time and work part time and he works full time and a fair bit of overtime as well. We don't have conventional 9-5 jobs so our weekends are harder to align together to be able to see each other. I have PCOS (ovarian cysts which make periods delightfully awful) and am on the pill to treat it but sometimes they have a mind of their own.

Last week, by some miracle we both had 3 days off together. Excited to make the most of it, he planned a hike and a big lunch after for day one, and two full days of being lazy, eating and having sex, all in front of the tv. Sounded perfect. 

Well morning of day one he was going to pick me up and we'd be off on our hike, but as soon as I woke up, the beaches of Normandy had been stormed. It was D-Day. 2 days early. Absolutely fan-fucking-tastic. I am crap at remembering to take the pill, this is my own fault.

Because of our haywire schedules and limited time together I had successfully managed to not see him when the Bolsheviks invaded. We hadn't even had the conversation about what happens for us during the invasion (do we have sex or not). But I couldn't do that this week. We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks it was starting to frustrate both of us.

I was miserable, I wanted to down an entire bottle of Midol and stay in bed. I texted him, ""Morning! Please don't hate me but could we hang out tomorrow instead and still do our weekend thing? My stomach is absolutely killing me right now"". 

He called when saw the text this is almost verbatim our conversation.

Him: shit, what's wrong??

Me: Nothing, I just woke up and my stomach is all crampy. It happens sometimes, I'll be fine tomorrow. I just need to stay in bed and not move very much.

Him: Did you eat something off yesterday?
Me: I don't think so, it will be fine tomorrow don't worry.

Him: You could still come over. We don't have to do the hike. We'll wear socks and slide around. Or I will and you can watch me 

Me: I really want to see you but I'll be shit company. 

Him: shut up you're never shit company. (Pause) Yo are you on your period?

Me: yeah ugh. How did you know?

Him: (laughs) take a shower. I'm coming to get you. 45 minutes okay?

Me: yeah it's okay. you're fine with me just being moody on your couch?

Him; yeah bitch. 45 minutes. Go.

I asked him how he figured out in the car and he said that once a month I'd get really weird about seeing him even if had time off and he thought horses when he heard hooves, not zebras. 

He handed me a bottle of Midol as soon as I got into his car  A liquor store stop and an hour later I was on his couch, good and drugged up, cradling a heating pad like the baby my uterus longed me to have, hating myself for being such miserable company and annoyed at him for making me want to see him so badly. He had disappeared into the kitchen while I repeatedly stabbed his undeserving remote combing through Netflix. He came back clutching a mug of some orange lemon tea that smelt like summer in one hand and a big plate of French fries in the other, looking very pleased with himself and rightfully so. I would have jumped up and hugged him had I not actively been trying to stop my uterus from self destructing. We traded the tea for the remote. He put on a Hitchcock movie to distract me, We wrapped up in a blanket and cuddled.

We took a break midway through to use the bathroom and smoke. The pain had considerably subsided by then. When we were outside he asked if I wanted to try some yoga to help with the pain. I told him it might feel a little awkward doing it, knowing he'd see me. So he OFFERED TO DO IT WITH ME. He'd found a whole bunch of videos on YouTube and downloaded them all. I should add that he's a big muscular guy, goes to the gym very regularly and loathes stretching but afaik begrudgingly does it. He's the guy who will tell you to never skip leg day.

Some of them required a fair bit of bending in awkward positions. We did them together, there were mock wails of wounded pride from him after he couldn't fold his legs for more than 10 seconds and from later almost falling over in a seated position. It was fun, he tried to give the poses new names, tried to bark during downward dog and ended up farting instead. That made us both laugh. It was the cutest thing, watching him laugh and fart with pride. It helped my pain, I'd forgotten how miserable I was and was just so grateful for him and his company. I told him how amazing he was and how much I appreciate what he was doing and just brushed it off. 

I woke up before him and wanted to wake him up to a cooked breakfast as a thank you and decided on cinnamon french toast. He eats eggs and toast for breakfast most of the time, and even though french toast is those ingredients they're strictly only for special occasions. It's his absolute favorite breakfast. I prep and wait for him to wake up.

When he wakes up and goes to the bathroom, I heat up the pan and begin toasting the first slice. He smells the cinnamon, comes running, sliding on his socks into the kitchen, screaming, ""CINNAMON BITCH"". He's so excited! I thank him once again for being so wonderful yesterday and hug him and he just brushes it off, more interested in breakfast. I have to practically push him out of the kitchen so I can serve him properly instead of tossing it on his outstretched plate like it's Oliver Twist.

I was raised to believe that getting your period was something really embarrassing and it has to be hidden away and never talked about; especially not with a boyfriend/male friend. He just blew all that up, didn't faze him, he was just his sweet ass self. In the past I've had my exes reschedule, get grossed out or straight up shame me for it, even if I said we didn't have to have sex, so this was so refreshing and thoughtful of him. 

I need to show him how much I appreciate what he did for me and saying thank you feels empty. He gets uncomfortable with verbal compliments.  I mean the man is acting like three slices of eggy cinnamon bread was a 7 course meal cooked by Wolfgang Puck and served by a naked Scarlett Johansson. I want him to know how much I appreciate him but don't know what to do.

t3_chjz4o,Wife suddenly locking phone,"Throwaway account.

My wife has more integrity than anyone I know. She wont even let us run both vehicles through a gas station for the full 30 gallons when we claim fuel perks.

But about two months ago she started texting another guy she met through work. She is in sales, he is a client. The dude is in an unhappy marriage and is clearly hitting on my wife. I have warned her about it, told her i am not a fan, but i am not going to babysit her and I trust her. She gives me regular updates abt how she keeps trying to help him fix his marriage. 

She has been dealing with a lot of stress. Sunday she disappeared for 3 hours. Claims she had a panic attack and just drove somewhere and then passed out. She said she had talked to the guy via text during her panic attack and he went looking for her but never found her... like i said i want to trust my wife, but then the following happened.

Today she was hospitalized, i came home she was passed out unresponsive and hyperventilating, remained that way for nearly an hour until she awoke.  Diagnosis was a severe panic attack. I grabbed her phone to take to the hospital and went to call her boss to let her know she wont be in. Her phone had a password lock on it. In the 7 years we have been married, neither of us have bothered to lock our phones. It wasnt any of our usual combinations either. So when she woke up i asked for the password and she said ""thats something I take to the grave."" 


She is hiding something from me and I dont know how to confront her about it. I let it go tonight because there were more important things going on, but i now am seriously concerned about this.

Tl;dr. Wife wont let me unlock her phone for the first time in 7 years of marriage.


Update: after posting this I couldnt sleep. She was still awake (texting that guy) and i came downstairs and basically told her that if she doesn't let me see the messages,  I have lost all trust in her.

She relented after much debate. (Good sign) there were only about 3 days worth of texts bc her phone deletes the oldest after so many texts. But in those 3 days worth of things the guy said he still hasnt told HIS wife (even though my wife was supposed to cut off contact 2 weeks ago if he didn't)

He kept mentioning his sexual experience and big dick. (3 times in a day) because my wife ADMITTED SHES ONLY EVER BEEN WITH ME. He would push until she commented it was inappropriate, and then resort to saying it was a joke. 

She was hiding it for a few reasons from what I can tell.

1. She complains about me to him (but she also compliments how much i do when she isnt feeling well)

2. She's talked about our sex life and how dysfunctional she is with sex. (To which he inferred she needed a better teacher and he had plenty of experience... but her husband (me) would probably not like another guy telling him what to do in bed.

3. She is venting to him about her emotional issues instead of me.

So she is teetering on an emotional affair, whether she realizes it or not. And the dude is using her as an escape from his bad marriage. I told her i dont feel comfortable with them talking anymore and her response was ""so i am not allowed to have guy friends?""


Update #2. 
Tried to be more talkative with my wife. Mend things. She insisted on talking about Dave even after I told her i wasnt ready to. So i blew up via text bc i am working. Sent her the wikipedia article on emotional affair. SHE ADMITTED THAT IS WHAT IT IS. And is now trying to defend it as not being any worse than when she complains to her girl friends. All while still claiming all she wants is me. Yet insisting she gets to stay friends, just not so close.


I told her that her having the option to run to him when having a bad day keeps her from needing us to work on our relationship. Will keep all y'all posted.",relationship_advice

I said, “how?” And he said something like “part of being a good wife is having sex”

Sooo I told Natalie that she has to either tell eric or I will. A shitty ultimatum. but I was very serious and even typed out a text to tell him and showed her. She said she was very certain it was his baby since apparently she only fucked Dylan PIV like three times, I guess I kept walking in on them and assumed it was more frequently than it was. But she told him herself. Which was a relief since I couldn’t do that. She told Eric that she wasn’t loyal but the baby was his and he was angry anyway and he broke up with Natalie. The thing was she was supposed to move in with him and all that so her plans were ruined. But yeah I guess he didn’t care after all if that was his baby or not since she cheated. Idk she was really sure that he was the father but neither wanted to pay for a paternity test since it’s expensive. Listen idk she said Dylan pulled out but she lets eric finish inside since she’s usually on birth control. 

She also cut our friendship after all that and hates me now. I asked some of our other friends and she’s probably gonna get an abortion because she can’t do it alone. Dylan found out and thinks it’s his baby and wants to be there for her but she basically told him that he’s nothing to her and fuck off and never talk to her again. He still likes her , I don’t know why since she’s mean to him and he could get any other girl but he liked her since elementary school. 

So yeah. Everything kinda sucks. I was looking forward to being an auntie. And I lost my best friend. Can’t believe she’s having an abortion. I wish I could be there for her to help her thru it since I know she’s scared but she hates me now.

I recently found out my wife(32F) of 3 years (been an a relationship for 15) has been having an affair with a male(42M) from her work.

Her phone went off one morning and something made me check it, that was it I seen everything. They were saying they missed each other, photos of each other naked had been shared. My word fell apart as I was scrolling though the deceit and lies.

&amp;#x200B;

I confronted her later that day. She confessed it had been going on for months, they had slept together twice and she was developing feeling for him and he had feelings for her. Her reasoning was he was someone to talk to, they would lunch together, chat over email at work. 

This left me feeling empty, was I not good enough, when I asked her this she said she felt she could no longer speak to me about her feeling and speaking to someone new was easier. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her to leave our marital home and she has been away for about two weeks now living with friends. We’ve met for coffee a couple of times but the chats go round in circles as I can’t seem to move past it. 

She wants to have me back, she wants our relationship, she claims to have stopped chatting to the male from her work.

Hello, it's me. Sorry about the new username, I made the first account thinking I would just post &amp; read the replies, so I couldn't remember the password as it was just a jumble of letters. Didn't expect so many responses, thanks for your insight everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

It seems folks were split on whether I was being: 1) an arrogant dick, or 2) completely clueless. I think it was probably a little of both. After spending years of slogging by in medical school living like a student, making so much money does really excite me, and I probably came on too strong with offering to buy her everything. It wasn't meant to be condescending, I just want to share my newfound wealth with the people I care about. But, as many of you said, it was patronizing to try and solve her issues with money and to throw it around like it means nothing to me. In the future, I will be a bit more mindful of money can cause a power imbalance in relationships. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is kind of a non-update, but I wanted to at least thank everyone for the help and tell you that I will take your advice and ease up a bit. I don't want to make her uncomfortable and feel like she's indebted to me. A couple of you suggested a take a page from her book and learn how to budget myself, so yesterday I texted her and asked if she could help me, and she said (and I quote), ""Yes, of course! Budgeting is fun, you'll love it!""

&amp;#x200B;

Color me skeptical. But she clearly knows what she's doing, and, knowing her, she probably will make it fun!

One more thing, to everyone who thinks I just came on here to brag about my wealth: the next time you're rolled into the OR, you'll be glad to have a competent, well-paid anesthesiologist in the room to take care of you.

Well, I took all your advice into consideration and made my ultimatum (leaving out the bit about inpatient). I was calm, understanding, and tried my best to be caring throughout the conversation.

His initial reaction was positive. He said he had no problem helping clean and do therapy homework for 5 minutes a day, so I thought that was that.

Today he told me he shouldn't have to do his diary card anymore since he isn't going to therapy, and I realized he thought I meant he could read and self therapy for 5 minutes a day and not go to real sessions.

I explained why that's not what I meant and that I need him to stay on top of going to therapy regularly and he told me that it was unfair of me, that he isn't capable of it, and that we are breaking up if I require him to go to therapy.

He made it official by bringing his parents into it, and will be making the 12 hour drive with his family on Saturday to collect his things and car and then head home.

When I asked him why my safety and wellbeing were not important enough to him to seek help, he gave various reasons but also made sure to point out that I am ""lame and uninteresting"" in his eyes since I no longer do any recreational drugs, and that I too have changed since the beginning of our relationship and am no longer fun.

So I guess that's it. Not the update you all were probably hoping for. I'm honestly pretty hurt that me being sober is a bad thing in his mind rather than a good thing, despite the fact that it's led to me being damn good at my job and made it easier for me to help others.",relationship_advice

And I know I haven’t been paying a lot of attention to him, and I promised him I would still, but I didn’t know the baby would need me this much.

My husband came home from work trying to have sex with me, and I told him “stop you know I can’t do this yet”. 

I’m in a lot of the pain and the doctor told me not to and he knows this. I’m also physically exhausted, I had a very long and difficult labor.

So he told me to “get on my knees”

I told him please I don’t feel like it.

And he told me “I provide for you, you do this for me”

I said no I don’t want to, and he slapped me. It was pretty hard enough to stun me.

I couldent believe he hit me it’s not like him at all. He’s never done that.

So then I just did what he wanted.

I don’t want to leave or anything crazy, he’s never done this and I have a baby to take care of and I can’t do that without him and his money. I feel very lost.

Initial post here 

So I posted here last time because I wasn't sure what to do, but y'all definitely helped me out a lot. I was overthinking it for sure, and I didn't really believe in myself. I had asked her if she was coming to the gym the next day through Instagram and she agreed, but she had an emergency and called it off. She did say she would make it up to me the day after, and well she did! We started our workout together and there has always been some tension between us, but it almost felt electric that night. I could definitely feel that something was in the air and well, she felt the same way! After the gym we talked for a few minutes until she got closer and kissed me! I was shocked but was able to go with the flow (still not a good kisser probably but meh), and she put my hands on her hips/ass basically lol. We made out for a little bit and when we finished we both just had a huge smile on our faces haha. Felt so surreal! We exchanged phone numbers and we did a kickboxing lesson together this weekend, which was loads of fun. Haven't laughed and felt this good in a long time. She invited me over to her place that night and we fooled around a little, definitely never expected it to go this fast. We've been texting a lot and still going to the gym everyday, and we're planning another fun activity this weekend. Still a bit unsure about some stuff because I'm inexperienced, but damn it's looking good.

I don't want to get attached too quickly, but seeing as it was building up to this moment for a long time we really, really like each other. She teases me about how I was so oblivious and that she started doubting if I was interested in her. In the end she took the initiative, but hey we're here now. I don't know what 'we' are at the moment. She has expressed she wants to be in a relationship with me and I'm game, but we haven't really discussed it yet. Anyways, thanks for the advice last time.

t3_choa7e,"My [22 F] boyfriend [30 M] is adamant I ""partially"" cheated due to a foot rub.","Background: I'm 22, boyfriend is 30. We've been dating for 6 months. My boyfriend is traditionally very attractive, but definitely has some insecurities and now I've started to notice, jealousy.  I'm a bit younger than my boyfriend and I sometimes feel a bit insecure on certain things due to the age difference.  
  

Setting: Last night, my boyfriend and I went to hang out with some friends of his at their house(a couple: M and F late 20's), that I hadn't met before. They aren't best of friends, but friends he sees once every few months or so. 
   

We were hanging out in their backyard, swimming, BBQing, drinking, over all we were having a really good time.  We ran out of mixer, so my boyfriend decided to run to the grocery store after a back and forth ""no, let me"" debate with his friend as my boyfriend is not really a drinker, and sober, he left for 30 mins or so.
   

I was talking to the girlfriend about common interests and we came upon the topic of injuries from sports. We both had cheered in highschool and were sharing injury stories. I mentioned the only thing that bothers me years later was my Achilles tendon on my left foot. If I do a lot of jumping, and walking it can get sore. Matter of fact, I could feel it right now, just from swimming.  
   

The girlfriend kind of stopped me in my tracks and said how amazing her boyfriend was at foot rubs, and he actually at one time was going to school for massage therapy. That ""I totally need to let him give me one"" and it would probably help. He kind of nodded his head and agreement and asked if I wanted one.  I had just met them and didn't feel entirely comfortable around them yet, so I declined.  She laughed and prodded ""oh come on"", so I said sure, kind of laughing at it.  
   

The boyfriend slid his chair over and I put my feet up on his thigh (right above the knee) and he started to rub my Achilles. All while, me and the girlfriend continued our conversation about injuries. She made a comment to her a boyfriend to ""do a good job!"" us both kind of laughing it off to him, and he moved from rubbing just the Achilles to kind of a full foot massage of both feet.  
   

Shortly thereafter my boyfriend came back in the midst of this rub, and I could see he was visibly angry. He remained calm but made a comment like ""thats enough of that"" and it ended and everyone kind of chuckled at it. We left shortly after because my boyfriends attitude had changed, and he kind of rushed us out awkwardly.  
   

I thought he was going to be excited how nice it all went, and that I was really personable with his friends. Nope. Not 10 seconds into the car, he instantly started berating me. He said ""I basically partially cheated on him"". I was blown away. He railed into a stance that getting a massage of any type, especially a foot massage is cheating if it's not in a professional setting. My boyfriend had an answer for literally every single thing I came up with in defense.   
  

I said it was the girlfriends idea and completely innocent. He said that he's sure his friend likely has a foot fetish, and I quote ""they have threesomes and were grooming you"".  
I said it was all about the Achilles injury. He asked why both of my feet were being rubbed.  
I said if it wasn't innocent, why didn't the 3 of us try to scramble and hide it? He asked why the offer for a rub happened while he was gone and not while he was there.  
   

He said that the age difference is why we have different point of views on this. That I'm 22 and still naive. That because of my age, there has been many times in the past couple months where I was oblivious people were making advances/hitting on me.  When prodded, he wouldn't give me any examples.  
   

Now that I'm sober and looking back at it. I don't know if the foot fetish or threesome thing is fact, or my boyfriend just being ridiculous, making shit up to defend his stance. Even though I felt like it was innocent, I'm starting to doubt my thoughts on it. I'm not sure if it was innocent in his friends/the girlfriend's view.
  

We haven't talked about this in depth yet, I woke up and am posting this first thing today after he dropped me off last night.

t3_chhijg,"I, M24 was just informed I may not be able to produce sperm anymore due chlamydia that my current gf F21 gave me","Said female and I have been dating for about a 9months and I noticed some strange sensation around pelvic region.  I went to doctor for some testicular pain and he took a swab of the area and inside penis. Results came back and it turned out I had chlamydia. I spoke with said gf about the results and asked if she had ever been tested because I had prior to being with her and everything was negative. She said ,”no I haven’t”. But, I’ve only been with one other guy (this other guy was a huge piece of shit and cheated on her a lot ). &amp; I told her , just because you hadn’t been with a lot of guys doesn’t mean he hasn’t been with many females. She agreed, and got tested. Results were positive and she felt bad for passing the disease to me. 

I told her it was no bid deal, there’s a cure, everything is ok. It happens. During all of this the doc is paying attention to my claim about testicular pain and  went ahead and scheduled me for an ultrasound anyway. 

I go ahead with the radiology appointment  and I get a call from him saying there were abnormalities present in the test and to come in asap. I get to his office today and he begins to tell me about irritated vessels &amp; inflammation. Then he leads into how he’s going to schedule another ultra sound in a couple of weeks to see if I’m producing sperm. Because it’s possible that the chlamydia has been in my system since we started dating 9 months ago. 

I was obviously taken back by this and started to freak out a bit. But,  he tried to keep me positive. I don’t have any children, but of course I want to some day. I told my gf when she got off work about what happened and her response was so bland. She didn’t show any concern or sympathy about the situation. She just said,”well, all we can do is wait and see.”  I understand that I may be having a pre-mature freak out, but not even a simply apology for making me go through this? 

She’s in a different room right now and I want to talk about it, but I don’t want to come off as aggressive and start an argument. Should I just ignore it all and wait till the second test? What should I do?",relationship_advice
t3_chnchv,My (27) boyfriend (31) ruined my birthday,"Throwaway as my friends and bf know my account. 

&amp;#x200B;

My bf and I have been together for over 4 years in what I would think is a healthy relationship. We rarely argue and talk through things rationally and calmly. However, the one consistent thing that has bothered me is his drinking. When we are together, we drink moderately and enjoy our drinks. But, when he is out with coworkers or we all go out as friends, he can't control himself. He gets very drunk very easily and ends up turning into a different person. He is easily combative, highly emotional, and can turn at any second. He has upset me with this on numerous occasions and whenever I brought it up the next day, he would hardly remember what happened the previous night. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other night my parents brought us out for my birthday to a nice restaurant I've been looking forward to going to for months. The same day, my bf had his summer party with coworkers and promised me he would be home early and wouldn't drink much. Instead, he shows up drunk to dinner and ruined the entire mood. He was so handsy, lounging in the booth with his legs up, hair messy, eyes droopy, and yelling at me at certain occasions for now apparent reason. My parents asked me if everything was okay and mentioned that he seemed very emotional, but I told them I'd talk to them about it later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once we left dinner, he kept getting more and more upset, yelling, banging walls for no reason, and ended up getting home before me as he decided to walk very fast. I ignored him as I came home, went to get ready for bed, and found him passed out on the couch. When I got ready for work the next morning, I left without saying goodbye which I never do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering an ultimatum: either stop drinking so much with your coworkers (or potentially stop drinking at all) or we break up. I love him, but the amount of times we have had the same issue come up has been too much for me. My friends and family think we should break up, but I know it will hurt so much to lose him. My question is, what is the best course of action here? What do you do when your partner has a drinking problem socially or do not know how to handle themselves in these situations?",relationship_advice
t3_chgokf,My husband is a contractor... and I just realized he is awful at it... but not before he took on building our house which has taken him 4 years to do. He knowingly manipulated me into believing everything was done correctly. Now the house is built and everything looks laughably horrible.,"Where do I begin. I have been married for 10 years with my husband. He is a contractor. We are both in our 30’s.

Our first year of marriage he got “screwed” on a huge job and to be honest, and it REALLY put us behind in life (at least where we wanted to be). We were hoping to use the money to buy our first starter house and long story short. It never happened. He reassured me the reason he was screwed was because the home owner was a scammer not because he was not able to deliver good craftsmanship. Of course i took him at his word.

We lived in a rented home for a few years and during this time he went into a bad depression where didn’t work, didn’t help around the house, didn’t move from the sofa, didn’t cook, and treated me very poorly. Meanwhile I worked two jobs to keep us afloat. This went on for about a year. One day I hit a breaking point, told him I was leaving. That day he went back to work, we got counseling, everything has been ok.

After we put this behind us, We wanted to build our first home so we moved into his parents house to save. Now we have lived with his parents most of the time we’ve been married. 

3 years ago we finally saved up enough money to build our own home. We went the self build route because “obviously” my husband is perfectly capable of spearheading this project. After all he has been in construction all his life. This would allow us to have enough equity on the home to double our money once sold.

The jobs I have seen him do turn out great. This is why I don’t understand what went wrong.

I am a designer by trade so I designed the home and he built it.

Over the years I have seen him deal with people who weren’t happy with their jobs, and I never thought anything if it. I just always assumed it was common for this industry.

Well. That was until my husband built our house.  The craftsmanship of the finished work is absolutely laughable. Beyond bad. Trim needs totally redone, ALL the tile needs ripped out, fireplace needs re-done. House needs completely repainted. I mean it is beyond bad. And when I would point it out and was open, he would gas light me and tell me I was insane and “that’s what it’s supposed to look like”.... i don’t know a lot about construction but I’ve never seen tile with half inch grout lines on one end and 1mm on another. It’s absolutely embarrassing.

The other part is this, he has taken 3 years to build this home because he refuses to stop working his full-time job or take a break. Even though I make enough money for him to take a break and focus sorely on the house. Which I begged him to do but he refused. 

I have gotten to a point where I can’t even enter the house without feeling complete anger because I KNOW this is not what homes look like. I know he’s totally full of it. But he has been making me question my sanity. My expectations aren’t high. I have been VERY patient. Everything is “not a big deal” or not “done” yet, until it is, and it looks the same. He’s been telling me that this is “how everyone” does houses.

I finally hit another breaking point today. And he FINALLY he admitted to me that he was burned out and just didn’t care. He did a poor job because it was ours basically, and for whatever reason he through he could manipulate me into believing that his horrible craftsmanship is “standard”. 

I’ve sacrificed a lot to have this home. We both saved a lot of money. We lived in SUPER uncomfortable living situations for years. I put off having kids. We basically spent all my 20’s working to the bone. Just for him to just not care?

And now I just feel super strung along and manipulated. And I’m honestly just at a loss on what to do. 

He does not want anyone to come in to fix anything... Because it would “cost a lot more” but (honestly I think because he is partly embarrassed/ and partly doesn’t want to be caught in more lies).... And wants to continue working on what is our FOURTH year into building this house, which is another year of putting off kids, not being able to invest into our futures, and another year of looking at this nightmare... This is not a HUGE home by the way. 2400sq. 

I feel like I’m living a nightmare. I just feel very let down, lied to, betrayed, confused. I feel like he doesn’t even comprehend how any of this could make me feel this way. Like...How many years of our lives have been wasted? And the whole gas lighting thing has left me drained. I can’t even look at him. 

I feel like i am so upset that I could honestly divorce him, walk away and never look back. Part of me feels shallow and that I’m not “upholding” the wedding vows i made. My question to you all is honestly, what would you do in my situation? In terms of my relationship AND this home?",relationship_advice

Tonight, she didn't come to bed, and I got up to get a glass of water and noticed her cuddled up to him on the couch. Now in what may not be my proudest moment I decided to look through her phone. I've found numerous instances of her calling him babe and saying I love you, and an instance of him saying he was ""blocked up"" and that she was ""glad she could help""

Now I work a lot and they do spend a lot of time together, but I would like to believe that neither one of them would stoop low enough to do something of that sort.

Am I overreacting or should I confront her?",relationship_advice
t3_chmbbr,[30/m] My [older/mf] relatives bought our dream house and didn't tell us until it was under contract,"Two years ago, a gentleman down the street from my parents in this nice neighborhood passed away. His son-in-law was in charge of the estate. We loved the house and we asked him about it. We talked for a while and he showed us around, we still loved the house. He said he wasn't ready to sell it yet and probably wouldn't be for some time as they live far away but said he'd keep us in mind before he put it on the market. That was fine with us since the $120,000 that it was evaluated at was a little bit out of our price range.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last 2 years, my fiancee has gone out of her way to drive past the house every few weeks and make sure it's not falling apart and talk about what she wants to do with it. My 6 year old son knows which room will be his. When we first talked to the guy about the house, we were really excited and told my family.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of that family was my aunt and uncle who have always been some of my idols. I didn't have the most stable early childhood but what was always constant was thanksgivings at their house and the love and warmth that came from it. It's always been my favorite holiday because of this. Well, 2-3 weeks ago we get a text from my Mom asking if we still had the contact number for the owner of the house because my aunt and uncle want to look at it. We asked them to look at other houses because they've got a lot of money and there's no way we could win a bidding war against them.

&amp;#x200B;

They said it was no problem, they didn't realize we were still interested, and they'd look elsewhere. We said that we'd call Monday the 22nd (now this past monday) to find out how low the owner would be willing to go because if it was still out of our price range then they'd be welcome to it. Well, Monday rolls around and my aunt and uncle text us saying ""I know you're not going to like to hear this, but we've done extensive research on the houses in the area and we are going to buy that house.""

&amp;#x200B;

We were heartbroken and my fiancee decided to go down and meet with the owners to ask if they'd still consider a bid from us. They said they absolutely would because they remembered that we were asking so long ago but said unfortunately they had just signed a contract and if we would've asked last week they definitely would've worked with us and the price they bought it for was well within our price range.

&amp;#x200B;

What hurts is that these people meant a lot to me. Not only did they lie when they said they wouldn't pursue the house, but they made sure they waited to tell us until they had it locked in. It feels like they just wanted to make sure we couldn't get in the way. I'm honestly at a loss of what to do. Thanksgiving is definitely out of the question at least until they move because even if our relationship can get past this, there's no way we could go into that house and enjoy it as someone else's. My fiancee sent a somewhat emotional text that I think she knew wasn't a good idea but she was having trouble holding it in - it wasn't super nasty but it certainly wasn't friendly.My parents said they'd follow our lead on this as far as Thanksgiving goes but they don't want to be pulled into the middle of the conflict - they'll be passive supporters - but they aren't thrilled about that text message either. As far as my response, I really don't know what to do. I'm trying to decide if I should go down and explain to them the personal hurt and try to understand why they did this or if it's better off just cutting them out and moving on - maybe they're not the people I've always thought they were.  I appreciate any outside perspective on this, thank you.",relationship_advice
t3_chn3nr,Update from yesterday - I can't talk to my husband without him getting mad,"Link to previous post here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ch7lpp/i_dont_know_how_to_talk_to_my_husband_without/?utm_source=reddit-android

Well.. let's just say it didn't turn out well.

My husband got home from work. We talked about his day, he took a shower, and he sat down on the couch. Everything was good. When he sat down, I said I needed to talk to him about something. As soon as I said that he rolled his eyes and said ""Alright go ahead, I thought I was gonna have a good night but go ahead and fuck it up."" I calmly explained I wasn't trying to do that, that I just wanted to have a conversation. I told him how I felt that we need to move and downsize so that we could get out of the financial hole we were in. He started screaming at me and yelling. I continued to try to talk to him calmly. He said ""Who put you up to this?"" (I said in my previous post his mother and grandfather have noticed we are struggling and have talked to him &amp; I wish they wouldn't have because I knew he would react this way) I explained that they did not put me up to it and I had not talked to them about it, but I knew they had talked to him. I said that I haven't said anything because I was waiting to talk to him on my own and that I had been nervous. I explained that I was nervous about our financial situation and if we didn't something, it was going to get worse. He started to laugh and said ""Don't make me say something to hurt your feelings"". And I didn't say anything and he continued to make that statement. He eventually said ""Yeah, I just think it's real fucking funny you didn't care about our fucking finances when I was making more money than you"". Which isn't true at all, our financial situation has never been like this. After he said that he continues by saying, ""I will fucking quit my dream job before I fucking move and it will be all because of you"". Last July, he quit his peevious job for his dream job and took a major pay cut. He continued to cuss at me and call me names. I just looked at him. I stayed calm somehow the entire time, but I finally got off the couch, turned, looked at him and said, ""What is wrong with you?"" He then told me to ""Get the fuck out of his house"" repeatedly. Nothing like this has ever happened before. So I quickly grabbed some stuff without saying a word and as I walked out the door, he said ""Yeah, leave like I always knew you would"". I stayed gone for like an hour, came home, and he was watching a movie on the couch like nothing happened. I tried to talk to him and he ignored me. I tried to talk to him again and he ignored me. I said ""Do you just want me to go to bed?"" And he said ""Do whatever"". So I went to bed and laid there sick on my stomach all night and he slept on the couch. Someone please give some kind of advice. I don't even know where to go from here.",relationship_advice
t3_chou2e,"How one classic book helped me find my true love (thanks to A Gentleman in Moscow) (Me 24 M and Me (M, 25)"," Now I really don’t believe in fairy tales, but I must say that the past month has been nothing short of one. I think when things want to happen your way, the entire Universe conspires to make it happen. So when a colleague I have hardly talked to since I joined my new company gifted me a book on my birthday, things started rolling.

I am not a big fan of novels. So when “A Gentleman in Moscow” was gifted to me, I was least expecting to read it. But one fateful night, I was too tired to go out and too bored to watch a movie. So I started reading the book instead and I was instantly hooked to the story. I finished it within the next few hours and I cant remember when I dozed off. The next morning, the only thing I wanted to do was visit Russia. Sounds crazy?

I worked hard and deservedly got a week’s worth of vacation time. I booked the tour at Hotel Metropol. The day I reached the place and entered through its magnificent doors was one of the best days of my life. After checking in, I visited all the places the Count frequented. I also got a veal tongue for lunch. In the evening I visited the Chaliapin Bar to get a taste of the Count’s favorite drink. And there I met him.

He, too, was on the tour and we started talking fervently about the book and our experiences after reading the story. He was witty and he found me funny. We had a great time together and before we knew, we were falling head over heels for each other. That was the best one week of my entire life. We arrived back to the States and although we are from different cities, we have met a few times and I plan to move in with him. Well, I found the love of my life. And its all thanks to “A Gentleman in Moscow.”",relationship_advice
t3_chneur,She was trying to make me a back up option and I admitted I’d fallen for her,"I think I screwed up. She was obviously trying to make me her back up option. We had been sleeping together and dating and then all this crappy stuff happened like her ghosting me and calling me obsessed and now suddenly she wants to be my friend? No, I’m not playing that game. I’d played one too many games with her already. 

She asked me why she didn’t follow me on social media anymore. I thought I’d just be honest and say what I felt. Which was I’d fallen for her hard even though it hadn’t been that long and her liking my insta posts while simultaneously ghosting me was super confusing and I had to delete her. id stood my ground and played it so well up to then. 

I know I shouldn’t want a girl who disrespects me enough to try turn me into a back up option. But I really do and I think I screwed up by saying this. I fed her ego and she probably thinks I’m a complete wet towel now.

t3_chjak4,How do I get over resenting my ex wife’s new man?,"My ex wife is a high school teacher and during a difficult time in our marriage she hooked up with one of her students (he was 18 at the time). They recently got married (she’s 46 and he’s 22). We have four kids together and we share joint custody, but I’m struggling.

Even though she’s the one that cheated, I feel like I wasn’t good enough for her. I feel like I let my physical appearance get too bad and she kicked me to the curb for this young hotshot. It makes me sick knowing that he’s raising my kids and to make matters worse, she’s pregnant with his daughter now. 

I never thought I’d be a lonely divorcee, let alone be replaced by some kid. I obviously hold resentment towards my wife, but I would say I have more anger towards him. I feel as if he ‘stole’ my life, my wife, my kids, ect.

Last night, I heard my 8 year old refer to him as her ‘daddy’. That was the last straw for me. As if it wasn’t bad enough that he has taken over my family, now he has my kids referring to him as MY title.

I have never really confronted him, though I’ve talked to my wife about some of my concerns about a 22 year old man raising 4 kids ranging from the ages of 6-16 AND a pregnant wife. It concerns me, but more importantly, it devastates me!

How can I stop feeling sorry for myself and not feel so much anger and resentment towards this kid? Do I talk it out with him? Do I talk to the kids? I just need some peace and closure. My health has slowly declined ever since all of this and I bottle up all my feelings around my friends &amp; family.",relationship_advice
t3_chh11b,"my brother (18m) is doing concerning, inappropriate sexual behavior that I (24f) worry could lead to a serious offense. Help?","Throwaway. On mobile too.

My brothers not a bad kid generally, Idk if this is important but he was adopted as a toddler. We had a generally positive normal relationship through childhood. 

When I was 19-20 (him 13-14). I’d come home from school for breaks or the summer and I noticed my bras and panties were going missing. Some of them would show up in my hamper a week or two later, and eventually I found a pair of my tights in there with,well, a dick hole cut out. He was clearly stealing my panties.

My parents never talked to us about anything sexual so when I brought this up they “solved the problem” by giving me a doorknob I could lock from the outside with a key as I left, and insisted “it was one of his friends. We’re sure” ugh! My mom sayyyyys she talked to him but I doubt it was a convo of much substance.

Well, now years later I’ve just been told that my brothers recent ex gf went to the police and is accusing him of assault. I don’t know exactly what happened but some of it involved him pinning her down and I guess he really scared her. My parents are saying she’s exaggerating bc he dumped her and I’m over here like no! This is concerning! Her family is hiring a private investigator or something to look into things, I guess it’s serious but no one will give me details. 

 I worry that if no one does anything it won’t stop there. The panties thing really violated my boundaries and personal trust towards him. &amp; why the hell would a teenage girl go to the cops like this all terrified if nothing happened?

Is there anything that can be done?

t3_chpc8t,Wife is getting really close with my best friend when they previously had no relationship beforehand and it has me worried.,"I'll try and give as much details as possible and I do want to say upfront that I really do trust my wife and haven't said a word to her about any of this because of that. It is getting increasingly worrisome once one of my wife's friends pointed it out to me.

I am 23(M) and she is 24(F) and we live in the US. My friend is 24(M) 

Some backstory here, I have been married to my wife for a little over a year and together for 3 years. She is incredible and we have had practically 0 relationship issues.

My best friend has been my best friend since I was two years old. We are inseparable and extremely close. He just graduated college and moved back to our town and my wife helped him out by getting him a job at her work (Insurance Company) as a financial adviser. They have never been friends before this and just talked because I'm obviously very close with both of them so they would interact while I was with both of them.

He got the job 4 months ago. Since the day he started the following things have started happening.

1. They text all the time. I see it at a glance but never really go through them, but they never once texted before. It isn't that weird considering they work together now but the volume is a lot.
2. He doesn't respond to me anymore. If I message him on Facebook or text him, he reads it and doesn't respond or if he does its 3-4 days later and he says he has just been really busy.
3. He insists on picking my wife up for their weekly office meetings and telling her how cool they look arriving in his sports car.
4. I get home from work and he has been there multiple times. Nothing weird happening, but he is just there watching TV and hanging out with her or doing whatever. He acts normal when I come in and acts like my buddy.
5. He gets licences to start working effectively and he doesn't tell me he passed his tests at all and he goes to dinner with my wife to celebrate. No invitation for me and I found out like 2 weeks later.
6. They go to Seattle every year for a big work conference and are now going together. They aren't sharing a room together but have made it clear they will be spending the whole time together and are going to an amusement park and stuff just them.
7. He made my wife switch gyms to go to his and they go nearly every day when before she went 2-3 times a week
8. He comments on all her pictures now going cuuuuuutttteeeeeee or something like that.

Am I insane? There are other small stuff I don't need to list out like how they talk sometimes. Am I being paranoid here? I haven't said a word to either of them except one quick snide comment to my wife as sort of a joke and she just brushed it off saying ""Oh yeah its cause we work together and you guys are best friends anyways"".

As I said before my wife's best friend pointed this out to me when I was only barely paying attention to it before at a house party we had last week and I started to realize it a little more.

A lot of it could be my insecurity. I'm not afraid to admit he is better looking than me and in really good shape. He has said before (like guys do sometimes) when we got together that my girlfriend was hot.

What do I do here? Any advice would be great.

t3_chje1d,I (24f) went on a BAD date this morning. I blocked him (24m) afterwards but I can’t stop thinking about it. How can I move on??,"So, as I said, I went on a date this morning. It was with a guy I met on tinder. From the get-go our conversation felt a little weird, with him messaging me every few hours even if I didn’t message back, asking to call me or send him snaps, etc. I arranged a date with him before these behaviors became apparent.

Our date was for coffee at 8:30 this morning. Right from the start, it was clear he was more into it than I was - he kissed me on the lips right when we met, and didn’t let go of my hand for the half hour we were in the coffee shop. After that, he suggested that we “go for a walk” (in a strip mall??) and when we were outside suggested we sit in his car. I didn’t want to make him upset, so I agreed. 

When we were sitting in his car, he kept kissing me. I told him 3 times I didn’t want to kiss, but he was insisting that I was “extending my lips” and that I wanted to anyways. Finally, he took the hint and stopped trying to kiss my lips, but kept kissing my cheek, my neck, etc. he kept touching me despite me saying I didn’t want him to. He was, overall, way too close to me and touching me way too much despite me saying verbally and with body language that I didn’t want him to do this. 

I left at 9:30, went home, and blocked him on everything. I felt gross that he ignored my boundaries and my physical/verbal cues. It’s now 1 am, and I still can’t stop thinking about it. I feel horrible and gross and so anxious. How do I move on from this? Has anyone else experienced this? 

TL;DR: I went on a date with a guy who was WAY more into it than I was. He didn’t respect any of my verbal or physical cues and now I feel gross and anxious. How do I move on?",relationship_advice
t3_chahvz,Roommate [M21] is uncomfortable with me [M21] having sex in my room,"I share an apartment with my roommate, who rarely ever leaves. Lately he has been getting annoyed that when my girlfriend comes over, he can hear us having sex (the walls are thin and not soundproof, but I turn a loud fan on).  We try to be as quiet as we can, but he has told me he can even hear our quiet conversations. The other day, he said we should give him notice before so he can go to the gym- but when I have done this, he takes 30-40 minutes to get ready to leave and is only gone another 30-40 minutes. On one hand, I appreciate him leaving to give us space but it’s a little strange to me that we have a designated “window”. My question is, does anyone have advice for meeting my roommates request? My girlfriend and I have sex maybe a couple times during the week max if that matters, I don’t think it’s an unusual amount.

(Edited to fix some typos)

Update: So I talked to my roommate and I wish it had been easily resolved but it was a little complicated. I forgot to mention my roommate also has an atypical sleeping situation- it is not consistent and he is basically nocturnal. He sleeps sporadically during the day and stays up at night (1am-8am). I brought up the situation, apologized and said I would do my best to keep sex within the times that he is gone but that we will have to compromise since it’s unreasonable to expect me to have sex on a schedule. I brought up headphones- he says the problem is that he is in bed trying to fall asleep usually when he hears us so he doesn’t want to put headphones in (this is during the day, anywhere from noon to 9 pm) I offered those foam earplugs, it was a no. He already had noise cancelling headphones that he will use if he is awake and hears us, and not taking a nap. It basically ended with me saying I will give him a heads up before, and he can leave or listen to music. He still wants me to refrain from having sex if he is trying to fall asleep. Im going to say this is resolved, and I’m being as considerate as I can. If this comes up again, I’m going to say it’s his problem not mine.",relationship_advice
t3_chjzv6,I (18F) think my boyfriend (19M) raped me. I don’t really know what to do in case I’m pregnant,"Sorry if im being confusing. My mind is all over the place right now 

 I always told my boyfriend that we can’t have sex because I’m not sure yet and he gets annoyed but he takes care of it after or he’ll finish while we’re kissing. but he never really pressured me. 

He lives with some of his friends and we were hanging out. They were playing basketball then we went back to his apartment and they were playing on their play station. I was in his bedroom on my phone and I was gonna fall asleep and I do that sometimes so usually I sleep over if I’m too tired. We sleep in the same bed with no problems like he doesn’t get bothered or extra horny, like he’s fine. So I was there and they were in the living room and I could hear them since the apartments so small and somehow they started talking about me and they were just making fun that he’s so whipped for me and I won’t even put out and he’s not a man. It was stupid like dumb guy talk. They’re like 12 yr olds like oh you’re so gay bro this and that. Idiots. He just laughed it off and didn’t really say anything so I thought that he’s so smart and mature and doesn’t care what they think. I guess they’re annoying guys and say that stuff a lot, they’re that type. 

Yeah it actually did get to him because he came to bed after they were done playing and he woke me up and started touching me really aggressively and being inappropriate. I asked him what he was doing and he was so mad and he told me that I need to relax and stop talking. I don’t really know if I can get into detail like maybe this post would be removed but basically he held me down and had sex with me. He didnt even have a condom and I kept asking him to please stop and he promised to buy me a pill. I did tell him to stop, I kept asking him and I started crying too. But I don’t know, he’s like really tall, the lights were off idk he was like putting his whole body on me so I couldn’t even move at all. it was so scary and he didn’t even care he covered my mouth because I was being too loud. This is so disgusting but when he “finished” he started kissing me and said he loved me so much, like he was trying to be sweet or something 

We went to the store afterwards and he seemed awkward and said he was really sorry he finished fast but hoped I had some fun. He bought me a pill and some other stuff too. Like pantiliners and condoms and a couple pregnancy tests and fucking candy to cheer me up. In his car he said he was so stupid for not wearing a condom and he started crying 

I feel so embarrassed. His roommates probably heard everything like me crying and asking him to stop. They both left early in the morning so they didn’t have to see us and we always hang out together in the morning and eat breakfast together and stuff. They definitely heard us. 

I don’t know. I think he felt pressured by his friends. But he didn’t have to do that to me. And anyway what am I supposed to do if I am pregnant. This is such a mess and I don’t feel good, he hurt me and the pill he made me take feels like hell. I feel like I have insane period cramps and my mom doesn’t know and I just told her I’m sick. 

I’d be so embarrassed if I’m pregnant. I’m only 18. My life would be over. I can’t believe he did this to me either like I really loved him idk He was so nice and never pressured me or was rude and he just went from 0 to 100. Like I always felt comfortable enough to sleep over with him and he never tried to touch me or start anything. And he just all of a sudden forced himself on me, it was like another person like it wasn’t him. He was just ignoring me when I asked him to stop as if he couldn’t hear me. God I don’t know. I hate my life right now. I wish I could rewind and go back in time or something. He came over and took care of me and made me soup since I told him I don’t feel good and he’s acting really nice. Like giving me massages and watching my movies with me even though he hates them and rubbing my stomach and making tea for me.

She got attached pretty quickly, and before long, she wanted to talk everyday (sometimes multiple times a day.) She said I love you early (maybe a month.) She also started talking about our future pretty quickly. And not just ""let's become exclusive"" future, but full on ""I can't wait to marry you"" future.  

&amp;#x200B;

It was too much too early for me, so I asked for some space. Well, that morphed into a bit of a fight. She accused me of having trust issues (guilty as charged). She also said I should stop leading her on if I don't want something serious. The fight got worse, and after she said something particularly unkind to me, I lost my temper. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's when I did it: I asked her what kind of mother is certain she wants to marry and build a life with someone she's only known for a few months. ""You're just getting to know me. I could be a child molester."" (AM NOT CHILD MOLESTER)

This is definitely the most below the belt thing I've ever said to a romantic partner, and I am very sorry for it. After cooling down, I called her to apologize, but she's not speaking to me.

He replied that it was kind and he felt flattered but because he is above me at work, he really shouldn’t hang out with me while he is my boss. A few hours later he texts me telling me that he wants to meet up and talk. So we end up walking around and talking for about 4 hours from life stories to our darkest secrets. It felt intimate and special like a friend you’ve known for a long time. I really felt secure with him and comfortable in what was going on. He then asked to sit in my car before I left and he ended up making out with me for over an hour. He then asked to have sex but I couldn’t because time of month. He totally respected that. He then grabbed my hands and held them and told me he felt something real and raw with us and that he wanted to try a relationship with me because it seemed right. 
So the next night he texts me again and asks me to hang out. I agree and we set up a movie date. The date goes amazing he’s kissing me through the whole movie and making me feel on top of the world. And then when we get into his car to leave he tells me I can’t keep seeing you if you’re working under me. Once you quit let’s try this for real. We make out and I leave. So I quit. I left my job and have a better new one set up for a few weeks from now. It’s a huge risk but I thought a good guy would be worth it. So I finish up my last day at my current job and text him to see if he wants to hang out and get no reply. I sent him a Snapchat and he hasn’t even opened it. So now I’m debating what do I do?

All my friends have told me that no reply is still a reply. And they think he’s a 6 and I’m a 9 so I’m wasting my time on a guy they think isn’t worth my time. But I feel like I want more closure than just getting ghosted. I want to text him and ask “I don’t mean to bother you but if you’re not interested in me can you just let me know instead of ghosting me like we never even met”.

Everyone of my friends says don’t text him but I feel that I deserve some insight as to what happened. I legit quit my job to try and date this guy and he does the worst thing possible.

Do I text him? Do I let it go?
I know I’m an idiot for leaving my job for a guy please don’t tell me that in the comments. I know I f***** up.",relationship_advice
t3_chp7tw,Best friend (24f) mad at me (25f) for not supporting her staying with her cheating bf (25m),"So this just happened last week and I am at a loss of what to do and if I am handling the situation like an asshole. Also, this is a long set up so please bear with me

Background information:

Me and my best friend live together with a third friend, and this is the third year of our lease. My best friend (Molly) has been dating this guy (John) for about a year now, and he has been living in our apartment since basically the start of their relationship (while leasing his own place in the next town over). John is really friendly to everyone and has a very loud personality. He is also one of those people who doesn’t have a filter, so he often says inappropriate things. For example, a couple weeks ago our other roommate enters the kitchen while us three were in there and he tells her that her shirt makes her boobs look big. Other comments he has made (while in my and my best friends presence) includes many remarks on other women’s bodies and clothes, comments on his ex girlfriends bodies (“her tits were huge”, “she could really suck some dick”), etc. 

In the beginning of their relationship he also behaved in questionable ways, such as standing Molly up for dates they had planned a long time in advance, being no call/ no show to plans with our group of friends, conveniently ‘forgetting’ to charge his phone while going out without her or going away with his guy friends, the list goes on. 

Furthermore, John only just got a job and had previously refused to do so, letting Molly pay for everything. His parents pay his rent and bills, but had taken away the car they bought him last year because of his refusal to work. Molly will often lend him her car for days on end, and he will even tell her she can’t have it back when she asks for it because he needs it. To me, these things are all huge red flags and I would occasionally try to talk to Molly about them but she denies there is anything wrong. At best, she will get mad at him for a day or two and then things will go back to normal. Molly also has severe anxiety, which I believe is the reason she will not end things with John. However, they have even fought about her mental issues, with John saying Molly is acting too “sad and annoying” when she is in a depressive or anxiety ridden state. On two occasions that I know of, he has left our house stomping and yelling at Molly while she cried in bed, saying he can’t stand being around her while she was “like this”. Despite all this Molly insists they are perfect together and in love, and we (all the people in the apartment) and our friend group were relatively close friends as it seemed like we could only hangout with her if he was around too. 

The Event:


These points are the basis of their relationship, however there of course are all the ‘good’ times and dates and other stuff I am not privy too as well. Cut to this weekend: I am bathing the dog when I hear crying and screaming. Molly runs down stairs bawling her eyes out holding Johns phone, which he had left to charge while going to his new job. Apparently Molly had been getting suspicious of John because he would constantly text another girls name who he claimed he was just friends with from college. So when he left she went to read the texts and saw that they have been VERY flirty, with John calling the girl baby, sexy, sweet heart, etc. and offering to “send pics”, saying “I’ll call you later/ let’s face time later”, “I can’t wait to see you”/“I miss you” etc. Molly said that they had been texting throughout Molly and Johns whole relationship, but he would call her crazy or say her anxiety and paranoia were acting up again when she called him out on it. He would constantly change his phone password when ever she found out his old one, and he would always try to steer her away from using his phone. 

Of course, Molly was EXTREMELY upset, shaking crying and ranting about John and how men suck etc. She called a couple of our mutual friends and Johns brother asking if they knew the girl and saying how John has been cheating on her. This continued for several hours until John got ‘home’ from work, or gets to our apartment I should say. As soon as John gets in the door Molly shows him the texts and accuses him of cheating on her. They go to Molly’s room and I hear screaming for maybe close to 45 minutes, but I move to the basement to give her privacy. Our other roommate was gone for the weekend so she was not there at all. Eventually I go upstairs to use the restroom but it is very quiet so I assume he left. I knock on her door to ask if she’s okay and if she needs anything, and John answers and says “Go away”.  Immediately I am annoyed that he was still there and he would tell me to go away in my own place after what he just did. I say “Molly are you okay?” And she responds that she is and she will text me later. I go to my boyfriends house for dinner and later on we return to my place to watch a movie. When we walk in (at this point several hours later) we find Molly and John cuddling on the couch. 

John greets us and asks if we wanted to watch Netflix with them. I said no and go to the kitchen, with my boyfriend following me. Molly walks in and I give her a look that says “what the fuck” and she tells me they talked it out and they’re all good. Before I could say anything other than”wow”, John walks in and tries to start a conversation. I do not respond to him and my boyfriend is uncomfortable and leaves to use the restroom (classic). Molly then mentions my party the following weekend (which her and our roommate were throwing for me in honor of a recent promotion), and John says how fun it will be. I tell him that I would be more comfortable if he did not come, and he asks me why. I say that I no longer wished to be his friend, and he looks at Molly and says okay and walks out of the room. 

The next two days, John and Molly plan a beach trip for the weekend with our friend group but do not include me. She had also been avoiding seeing me or talking to me, and our other roommate says I am being an asshole. I feel as though I am losing my best friend, but I don’t think it is my place to push her into ending the relationship. I’ve reached out asking if she wanted to talk about what happened and she did not answer me. Also, truth be told I am tired of doing damage control on her relationship crises just for her to ignore advice and all other red flags and continue to be with her bf. I think he is toxic but I am at a loss for what to do. Also, I am pissed at our mutual friends who I feel like are supporting their relationship even though they know what happened.",relationship_advice
t3_chnsim,Insecure needy man,"I've been seeing a man for about a month now and I'm crazy about him. The problem is, he's been really mistreated by women in the past and is highly insecure. Every time we've had sex he over analyzes and he gets very insecure and says that my reactions during sex make him think he's inadequate. I'm not a super vocal person, but I'm definitely not quiet or unresponsive when we sleep together.
 I've never, ever dealt with such bad insecurity, and I'd like to help him threw it, but when I do compliment him he wont accept it or believe it most of the time, which is frustrating and stressful. I am in no way going to throw in the towel, I just really want to know what to say and how to help him threw this insecurity so that he can feel my sincerity and how I feel about him.

I have my own insecurities and fears, I fear that if I come on too strong, tell him that I feel like I'm falling for him that it'll scare him away, but at the same time I don't want to hold back and lose him because I don't express myself enough.",relationship_advice
t3_chhpw7,My husband just bought a really expensive sex doll and it’s really getting to me,"I’ve been married to my husband for 7 years now. I’m a 29F and he’s a 32M. For a few months to a year now, I’ve been saying no to sex a lot. I’ve just not been in the mood but his libido has been at the same sky high levels that they’ve been since we were college kids. 

Some days when I’m in bed tired he starts touching me, trying to get me primed for sex. Most times I’m not in the mood, but some times I cave in to his begging. I felt as his wife it was my duty. But I never enjoyed any of those sex sessions.

So I made my feelings known to him. At first he seemed really down but he said he respected my decision. He stopped asking me for sex after that. Even when he asked, after I said no he would just roll over and go to bed.

After a month or two, he suddenly came him with a sex doll. It was a really expensive one, with huge tits and a round ass with very human like skin. When I confronted him about it he said he had sexual needs and since I couldn’t satisfy them he had to find a way to satisfy himself without cheating.

When he said that I felt like I couldn’t say anything. It made me feel really insecure, and I suddenly feel really awful. I can’t tell him to get rid of it because it’ll make me look really selfish. I also can’t complain about how expensive t was because we’re pretty well off. 

I noticed one night that I was in the mood but he told me he was tired. He had had a few rounds with the sex doll before I got home and was pooped out. I don’t know what to do at this point, but I knew I feel awful.",relationship_advice
t3_chd3km,"Today is my 1st anniversary, I want a divorce","This is more of a rant than advice needed. I know what I need to do, it’s pulling the trigger. Throwaway account obviously.

tl:dr: I’m going through a bunch of shit right now. New husband has sat on his ass and not helped. Today is our anniversary but I don’t want to celebrate, I want a fucking divorce!



As the title states, today is my first anniversary. It will be my last. My husband and I eloped last year after dating for five years.  We eloped because he couldn’t be assed to make a real plan, and cancelled two prior weddings.  (yeah, I know)

My family can’t stand him. All except my daughter from a previous relationship, who’s 10. She loves him and he is good with her. They play and he helps with homework, gives advice, goes to school events, etc.

That said, my husband has never moved in! He technically lives in his own home that he owns but spends every night in the home I own.This allows him to escape all responsibility for cleaning, paying bills etc, because he doesn’t live there and still pays bills at his home. (yeah, I know).

My bills include student loans, day care, and routine home mortgage, etc.  I do not receive child support.   (Father was largely willfully unemployed).  While I am employed at a full time (and decently paying job) as a single mom, it’s tight. Husband doesn’t help with bills.

As if this wasn’t problematic enough, my daughter’s father has decided that he would now like to be involved and sued me for joint custody after being absent 10 years. I’m hemorrhaging money for lawyers to keep my kid safe (he has assaulted his current wife multiple times, and has been convicted and has had dealings with CPS).Between that, and unexpected medical bills (I found a lump ya’ll, lets hope it’s all good), I can no longer pay all my bills. While Im up to date today, I have nearly exhausted my very meager savings and maxed out the cards.  I believe the solution is that I will sell the house and try to live with my sister for 6-9 months to get some savings (paying rent, I’m no mooch). 

Where is the husband? sitting on his ass watching all of this go down.  Husband has made no effort to sell his home (his is a bachelor pad with not enough space for an instant family) AND i learned 3 days ago that he is sitting on 50k in savings.  What?!?!?I told him my plan to sell and live with family and all he had to say was,  I guess I won’t be able to come over any more. WTF you are my husband, that should not be your response!

Anyway, he is taking me to dinner today to celebrate our anniversary. today, i cannot divorce. I have neither money or internal fortitude for that on top of all the other things. I will save that fight for another day (that day will come,  but not now). FML.",relationship_advice
t3_chpz1w,"I (20F) had a pregnancy scare, and my bf (23M) has been acting emotional, not sure how to stop being upset with him","Alright, so this all started a few days ago. My shrink suspected I might be pregnant, so he had a referral written for me to go take a lab test to check. I went to a different hospital to get it done the next day and was told they would call my doctor and he would call me. I had told my boyfriend and I spent the day stressing at work over it. I get home (I still hadn't gotten the test results then) and call him to discuss what we would do if I was pregnant. He assured me that whatever I wanted to do he would be down for, and he just wanted me to be happy. I pressed him, but he swore he was telling the truth. I tell him I don't think I'd want to get an abortion and he agrees.

&amp;#x200B;

 I go to bed and the next day I'm bombarded by text messages sent at like 4 am from him about how he's freaking out and so not ready and doesn't want to do this. This upset me because I felt lied to and wished he had told me that from the start instead of just texting me. We talked on the phone and I said I'd get an abortion if I was pregnant and said I wanted to (which was a lie, I just didn't want him to feel worse because I was worried he was having a panic attack) It turns out I wasn't pregnant. We are both relieved, but a part of me is angry he dumped all of that on me through text when I was already in an extremely emotionally vulnerable state, which he knew since I did a lot of crying on the phone the night before.

&amp;#x200B;

We had made plans to go to the beach on friday, and I texted him that if I was standoffish it was because I wasn't very happy with him. He asked why. That pissed me off. i tried to stay calm and say I wasn't mad at him, just upset in general. He apologized, but I was still a bit annoyed. The later on I was talking to him about a jacket I was thinking of buying and asked if I would look good in it. He said ""You know what I think is beautiful? Not spending unnecessary money on shit like you do"" and I was offended. I tried to diffuse the situation by agreeing, but I don't even know why he cares. We don't live together or share finances and I normally pay when we go out to eat so its not like I'm broke. This made me feel resentful. I'm supposed to see my boyfriend today after work but I'm still sort of mad at him. I know I'm probably wrong to be mad, but how do I get over it? I love him and I don't want to ruin our time together being salty. Should I talk to him about it?",relationship_advice
t3_chm0sp,BF wants to go on a trip with his female besfriend?,"Basically as the title states. My BF is planning to go on a 2 week trip overseas with his female bestfriend. They've been friends for over two years now and this was something they had planned prior to us dating (we've been dating for 6 months). They've been on a few trips together before &amp; evidently they're super close with each other.

He insists that they're just ""friends"" and love each other like siblings but I feel like it's odd to have a friend of the opposite sex as a solo travel buddy...especially when you have a girlfriend. I've asked him to cancel the trip because I don't like the idea of him being alone with another girl for 2 weeks, but he told me I was being petty. What should I do?",relationship_advice
t3_chobid,My mom is very unhealthy and is passing these habits to my (26f) sister (8f),"My mom is both mentally and physically unhealthy and is passing this on to my much younger sister. I don’t know how to act without overstepping. 

My has always had very poor  habits but over the past 10 years everything has really gone down hill. She is extremely overweight. I don’t know specifics but she’s about 5’1 and weighs close to 300 i think. She’s a chain smoker, probably a pack a day. She never drinks anything but pop. She literally says  water makes her throw up. So from the minute she gets up to when she goes to bed, pop. She doesn’t eat anything healthy and is extremely picky. She only likes fast food or meat heavy dishes like pork roast. She hasn’t touched a vegetable in years. Not even on her burgers. Her teeth are rotting out. She went to the dentist yesterday and she has over 10 cavities. Should wouldn’t tell me how many specifically but it’s over 10. This is from her drinking pop, smoking, eating non stop sugar and not brushing her teeth. She has diabetes but doesn’t take care of it. At all. She also has a few other health issues that go unmanaged. She also naps everyday for about 2 hours. Every day. This is just physically unhealthy. She’s also mentally unhealthy. She’s very lazy. She’s also depressed (again unmanaged). She thrives on drama. And she’s in a very very toxic relationship but misery likes company I guess.  that’s just the tip of the iceberg with her. 

That’s her life, do when you want. I’ve had numerous talks with her and it never goes anywhere so I gave up years ago. Here’s my problem, she’s instilling these habits in my sister (8f). Yes we’re really 19 years apart. My sister has a lot of health issues. Non that are in her control, she basically just hit worst genetic lottery possible. But with all these, she’s fully functioning. Non of them are mental, all physical but none that affect her day to day very drastically. My sister spends a lot of time at my house. I think it has to do with getting away from her parents constant fighting and the fact that I take her to do things. My mom doesn’t encourage her to get out of the house. In fact, if she sat on her tablet all day and let my mom nap and watch tv, my mom would be thrilled (mom works very part time nights). My sister spends most of her time on her tablet or computer in her room. She’s a couch potato at home. When shes at my house, she’s always outside playing with the dogs or my son. She wants to go to the pool or the park. She WANTS to do things. I’m sure she wants to do things at her house too but my mom just doesn’t want to so they don’t. 
Another thing is my sister has terrible eating habits too. Yesterday I picked up some produce and she was so curious about something I had. Asking me a million questions about it, begging me to try it. It was a peach. She’s 8 and never had a peach. And it’s not because she doesn’t have access or my mom can’t afford it it’s because my mom eats like shit and so does she. She loved the peach btw. I made spaghetti for dinner. Plain ole spaghetti. My sister wouldn’t touch it. She insisted on buttered noodles instead. Then I encouraged her to try a green bean. She gagged. My sister will come over at like 5 pm and say she’s starving because the only thing she’s eaten all day was cereal (and I’m sure it’s like lucky charms or other pure sugar). But then won’t touch anything I make because it’s not pork roast or buttered noodles (im vegan but I’m not a health nut or anything so I don’t cook meat but I don’t force her to eat salads or anything. Ill make grilled cheese or basically recreate anything she’d eat at home but she still won’t touch it because it’s “vegan”.) I usually have to force my sister to brush her teeth. She also has a bunch of cavities and her teeth are pretty yellow. 

With my sisters diseases, she could really benefit from staying active and eating healthy and I feel like my mom is really really failing her. I don’t know how to approach this. My mom is not easy to talk to. She’s going to say I’m over stepping or I’m not perfect so I have no room to talk (I’m also overweight, I have a hormonal disease that makes me blow up. But with that said, I try and instill great habits in my son. I encourage activity, healthy eating, and cooking. Even if I’m not perfect, he can at least have the tools to be successful later in life but I digress) 
What should I do? 

Sorry this is all over the place too.",relationship_advice
t3_chqj2i,I comforted my moms married friend. Need help ASAP on how to deal with this.,"Firstly,  i doubt anyone of you are gonna believe this. But whatever, it's true.  I'm not asking for a 'fist-bump' or anything. I'm asking for advice on  how to deal with this mentally.

To  lay it out, i'm a 21 year old male. My moms friend is currently a 54  year old woman and has known my mom (and as an extension, myself) for 40  years. They went to school together, lived near each other. All that  stuff. She's not Lisa Ann attractive. But she's also not ugly. She's fit  for her age. Unimportant, but i'm not trying to make y'all believe i  had sex with a bombshell.

We  don't see each other often, only really for family gatherings, but  we're still close family friends. She does see my mom every week though  so they talk a lot. My mom also trusts me, so she tells me everything.  For the past few months, she's told me that her friend hasn't been happy  with her husband recently. He's been manipulative and acting stranger  than normal. And hasn't been giving her any attention. Now i don't care.  I just entertain my mom to give her someone to rant at.

Yesterday  night, i was on playstation with a couple buddies. My mom asks me to  take down some spare sweets (My mom works in a cafe, so she's always  cooking) to her friends house. After a short argument since we were in  the middle of a raid, i agreed. I head down there, give her the sweets  and she invites me in for a drink. I can't be assed, but i'm not an  asshole. So i go in.

We're  talking. She asks me about university, how my degrees going, all that  stuff. After a short convo, she breaks down. Tells me everything/most  things she's told my mom about her husband recently. Mentally while  she's explaining this, i'm remembering what my mother told me about her  and her husband. Maybe it's the wine, but i teared up too. One hug leads  to another, and we sleep together.  On the way out she thanked me.

I  hurry home, get back to my room (my mother was sleeping) and i break  down. Maybe it was me feeling sorry for her, or the guilt for what i've  done. I don't know. I throw up shortly after and haven't eaten since. I  don't know how to cope with this. My mom knows something is up since i'm  barely speaking to her or my siblings. It's the next day now and i'm so  sick to my stomach. I don't know what to do, i feel like the biggest  piece of shit in the world. But she also thanked me, so i clearly helped  her out. I just don't know.",relationship_advice
t3_chphip,My[F19] sister's [F22] relationship with her husband [M25] worries me,"So, my sister doesn't live with us, she lives with her husband in another state, she's visiting us because here we're going to celebrate her daughter's 3rd birthday.

I need advice because honestly I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't know if I might be exaggerating or not. Would you please tell me if this is something to worry about or if I'm just overthinking this?

And just a heads up, I might be a little biased because, well, I fucking hate the guy and I'm gonna tell you why, this might be a little long but bear with me please 

When I was 14 years old my sister visited us (she was living with my grandparents at the time) and of course, she told me all about her boyfriend, they've been together I think 1 year by that time. He and I had talked before, and we went along. It was really exciting to see her because we hadn't seen each other in two years, so we try to spend time with each other, talking and watching movies and another sister stuff. The problem started when he began to get mad if my sister didn't text him every single moment of the day, if she didn't text him she had to tell him why. That was the first thing I noticed that worried me. Then he elevated things, if she was on line (on Facebook, WhatsApp, etc) but not talking to him, he would sent her a message with ""who are you talking to?"" She wasn't talking to anybody, so she would say that to him, but he wouldn't believe and would told her to stop being on her phone, he doesn't want to see her on line. We went shopping and she bought some cute clothes to wear in Christmas, it was a cute top and skirt, she's short so the skirt was really long on her, she showed the clothes to her boyfriend and he prohibited her to wear that. I was shocked by that and even more shocked when she listened to him! 
But that's not all, he would constantly tell her he would pay plane tickets for her if she wanted to go in that day or the next one, mind you, she was staying here for only 2 weeks, she would decline and he would get mad. All of this seemed like big red flags to me and I said that to her, but she just brushed it off. In the last week, they got in a big fight. She was crying inconsolably, like broken hearted crying. She told me he had told her he was going to go out with some girls and basically told her he was going to cheat on her, that the only reason he was with her was because he thought she was pregnant (her period was late, but that day she got her period). She recently had gotten an ectopic pregnancy, they were trying to have kids but they couldn't. That made me hate him, and I still do. It was just a cruel thing to do. 
But guess what? They made up, and she left happily.

They married the year after, because she was pregnant.

So now she's here, she tells me every time they have a fight. The first one was because of money (he wanted to buy some stupid shit and she told him not to), the second fight was because she didn't told him she was going to buy some food (she left her phone in the house, he called. She didn't answer. The food stand was 5 minutes from my grandparents' house). The third fight was because he wanted to video chat with his daughter, but my niece was asleep and he got mad because my sister didn't called him earlier. The fourth one, happened just days ago, he was horny and wanted to sext or send videos idk, and my sister fall asleep, he got mad and immediately asked her if she was cheating on him, if she didn't like him anymore, and then told her their relationship wasn't working and he wanted a divorce. 

He has threatened to get a divorce in almost every fight they have, which I think is a shitty thing to do. My sister called me at 2 in the morning because of this, and she literally told me is her fault because even when she was with him, sometimes she would tell him she doesn't want to have sex, or she falls asleep, or something, so he gets mad, but doesn't make her to do anything, and they fight about it. I was shocked when she told me that, I told her it's not her fault she doesn't want to have sex, he should respect that. If he was horny he could masturbate, but not shame her for not wanting to have sex or for falling asleep. She said he told her after telling her he wanted a divorce, if she meets someone else she shouldn't do that to that person, or then they gonna leave her for another woman. I can tell she feels guilty because she sometimes doesn't have sex with him, she told me she knows she have to because they're married and I just said she doesn't have to if she doesn't want to. She says he respects when she doesn't want to have sex but I told her its not respect if the first thing he thinks is that she's having an affair, or that something must be wrong with her (he had mentioned he thinks she had a sexual deficit or some stupid shit like that), if he really was worried about her, he wouldn't act like that, or idk just simply understand she doesn't want to have sex?? 
She stills defends him, she thinks it's her fault. She said he acts like that when she's away, that when she's gone he just doesn't think straight, she said he had a strong character and when he was mad he would do that stuff. I told her just because he's mad he doesn't get to treat you like shit, he doesn't trust you if the first thing he thinks is you're cheating on him.

I don't know what to do, I don't know if I'm overreacting or not. I've never been in a relationship so I don't know a lot of things. She says he's a good husband and a good father, but I just don't think he is because of how is he acting right now.

t3_cho03b,My[33F] husband [33M] does not have money for food but does for porn.,"My husband and I have been together for over 8 years. We are a middle income family of two that is just keeping our heads above water. The last few years our funds have been devoted to renovating and repairing our character home an ongoing project with no end in the near future.

The issue that spawned this post is from finding that he had resubscribed with a newly created email account to a porn website last night. I  really do not have much of an issue with my husband viewing porn. I won't lie I wish I could afford the lashes, lip injections, perfect hair extensions and a little more time at the gym but I digress. Paying for porn, I do have an issue with. Yesterday evening we were out for dinner for the first time in years with friends and he told me before we left the house that he did not have much funds so that I would be getting dinner for the both of us. That's cool. I  do not mind. Dinner was about $40ish after tax, not bad. He tipped the waiter $10. When I got up this morning to get ready for work I noticed his computer was left on overnight. This is mild irritation as we don't have air conditioning and both our computers run pretty hot. Screen was left open to (in a new email account I was not aware of) a porn website stating thanks secondchoicetea husband! Your payment of $16.55 has been approved at 11:53 PM which was about 30 minutes after we went to bed last night. It bummed me out. Not enough funds to share a meal with me. But enough for that clearly. 

It irritates me as this nearly identical situation happened 4 years ago. He did not have enough money to pay his phone bill. So I paid it. He got a new email account and subscription to porn site later that evening after I went to sleep. I ended up confronting him the next day but he was eyeballs deep in addiction at the time and it was not a very productive exchange. 

The other week my Dad gave him $150.00 for doing some work on his car and said here take secondchoicetea out for a really nice dinner. It never happened and I ended up paying for groceries that week.

t3_chfgmt,My gf (23F) believes that she should wear the pants in the relationship. I (23M) am striving for equality and a relationship that doesn’t always tend to one persons needs.,"Literally, every argument we have is won by her, simply because it’s either her way or the highway. Frankly, I hate using the term ‘won’ because that implies we’re fighting for pride, that’s not how I want it, but that’s how she makes it. 2.5 years of being together and just this morning she told me that she should wear the pants and call all the shots. She’s saying that I’m not what she wants cause I want an equal relationship? 

I’m so lost. 

What the f*#k is this mentality where it’s okay for someone to take control of every decision that also has an affect on their partner? 

I’m creeping closer and closer towards leaving her. 

Please help me talk some sense into her. Give me some advice as to how I can fix this. I really don’t want to lose her. Surely we can be adults and treat each other as equals.

UPDATE: I broke up with her. Not sure what on earth is going to happen now. But I’m going to hold strong and do my best to keep myself together. She has been abusing me all day and no matter what I did to rectify the matter. It would not work. She just kept insulting me and even went as far to say that her ex, who’m btw abused her, treated her better than I. That was the last straw and now I’m just trying to do my best to mitigate the situation. Thank you to everyone who woke me up and to those who spent their time replying to me.

t3_chlol7,How much sex is the right amount for a married couple? Just looking for opinions.,"I don’t even know where to start. I’ve been with my husband.. complicated, was my wife for 13 years. We have been married for 5. In the last two years he transitioned from being my wife to my husband. I was cool with it that’s not really the issue. However we are literally never intimate anymore.  If I were to count it I would break my heart. Maybe 2-3 times in as many months. We used to be rabbits pretty much. Very in touch with each other and what the other person wanted. Now when we do get intimate it’s always mind blowing amazing but very rarely does it happen.  

 He has a lot of rules, Like only at night, Only in our bed. Never on holidays.  I have to initiate it or ask for it. There has to be “preparations” like getting a towel and shit ready. It.... just completely kills the mood for me. I don’t even know what it’s like to have “passionate sex” or have someone rip my clothes off. I’m super sexually liberated and want to fuck anywhere (legally) and try all kinds of crazy stuff. But with all the rules and lack of spontaneity I don’t even feel interested anymore. Any thoughts? Is there anyway for me to care less about the “prep” or how can I help him be more spontaneous?",relationship_advice

I, personally, do not think think a serious relationship has to involve love. 
To me, a serious relationship is a long-term, monogamous relationship. It involves things such as each member of the relationship having met each others friends and/or family, and they plan things together in the future such as vacations or events.
A serious relationship to me involved commitment, trust, and mutual respect.",relationship_advice
t3_chq48o,My boyfriend constantly tells me not to cheat on him!,"We been together for a year. Lately he tells me everyday that not to cheat on him it's getting really annoying. 

He told me if he finds out I'm cheating on him he's just going to leave and never see me again and he promised that.  The fact that he keeps worrying about it bothers me because when he was younger he said he cheated on his wife cuz he didn't love her so I don't understand why he thinks I would be a cheater when I never cheated on any of my boyfriend's and he knows that.

I was so annoyed that he kept telling me that that, so I told him since I'm a Scorpio and if I find out you are cheating on me I'm going to cheat on you and prove it in your face and then leave you just so you can feel my pain and he got really upset and bothered that I said that but I can't help it that's who I am.

t3_chal71,"My [19F] younger brother [16M] is becoming increasingly hateful towards women, because of my mom's affair","Hello, I would like to seek some advice on how to help my younger brother, who I think is becoming an angry, depressed kid.

Backstory: My parents are in the midst of divorce proceedings, after our mother was found having a prolonged affair last year. My brother was the one to catch them in the act, and I think the responsibility of letting the family know weighed on him a lot. He has told me he is absolutely furious with our mom for doing this to dad and the entire family, and that she's a whore. I understood his feelings and was (am still) similarly angry at her for being so incredibly selfish that she would throw away all of our love just for her own feelings.

Recently, my brother's rants have taken a worrying slant. He is now insulting women in general, calling us all sorts of degrading names. I've overheard him say that women deserved to be raped, while he was gaming. I've called him out on this multiple times including by pointing out I am a woman too. But he has always assured me that I'm ""not one of them"" and ""different"", whatever that means, and then does nothing to change. My suggestions of either individual or family therapy to process my mom's cheating (and maybe to help him on this issue) have been ignored by everyone in the family, including my elder brother (25M) who is not at home.

I am afraid that this is terribly unhealthy and he shouldn't be left alone to fester. I'm moving out of state for college soon. I hate to see my brother stay behind and suffer. I've raised this concern to my dad, but he is low-key spiralling into alcoholism and actually agrees with my brother on his views of my mom.

I would love some advice as to what else to do? I'm not his legal guardian, I can't force him to do something he doesn't want to do. My parents are not helping.",relationship_advice

t3_chpha8,Are homemade gifts equal to financially bought gifts?,"Sorry for the long post 

So im a uni student and so to be honest am completely skint. My boyfriend has a decent job and likes to spend money on me which i am extremely grateful for. He bought me this dress for my birthday id mentioned offhand i liked and i was blown away that he remembered and got me in. Ive bagged myself a real sweetheart. 

I wanted to give something back but couldnt afford anything amazing so painted the night sky the exact time we first met up and kissed (we'd talked for two months before actually meeting up) and included a Shakespeare quote because he and i like Shakespeare. 

My bf said he loved the gift and it was sentimental and beautiful but when i called up my mum who sidenote didnt even ask what the gift was and said id made something homemade she stated that it wasnt enough considering how much for my bday he had spent on me. 

We went out (not saying where as dont want to give myself away) and when arrived he revealed he'd already brought the tickets for me and had pre ordered tickets for something else, then he had also got me the dress.

I ended up buying him somethinf too but im already way into my overdraft so puts even more strain on my bank account but i just want him to know how much i love and appreciate him and was wondering if a homemade sentimental gift is equal to a gift that has been paid for really.

t3_chnpl3,MY BF (28M) of 1.5 years has basically stopped having sex with me (28F) and I dont know what to do," 

So since I moved in with my BF our sex life has declined. I understand that’s a natural thing in a relationship. At first I attributed it to his new job with long hours. We were on opposite schedules and he worked in the evenings. We talked about the change around December. I thought something was wrong so I went through his phone. ( oh shhhhh - yeah it was wrong but that’s a different discussion) Porn - EVERYDAY- while I’m at work or while I’m sleeping he’s watching porn and not having sex with me. I confronted him. He said he’s just edging himself most of the time. He said he would go back to the therapist and get on his meds and start working out again and it would change his sex drive. He seemed sorry for neglecting me. So I gave him some time. I let it be. He started therapy so I thought it was good news. 

We had the same conversation in April because I realized we only have had sex six times that year at that point. Same answers when we talked again…. Going to the gym… therapy ect. - I was skeptical about his gym comment because he mentioned it before and never started going. I thought because he was in therapy it was a good sign. 

Cut to now. I can count how many times we have had sex this year on my fingers and toes. Well I couldn’t sleep last night. I was trying to look at some school information I had previously viewed and I went into the history and I immediately was able to see his browser history. Porn everyday - for at least the last sixty days - and he watched it right when he left to go to the other room to sleep. I am LIVID. He stopped going to therapy out of laziness and he’s been to the gym - never. 

A couple of important notes.

&amp;#x200B;

* I have no problem with porn. I watch it all the time 
* My boyfriend has anxiety and depression. He is also an introvert.

To be honest we have gained some weight - about 30 lbs each - and I quit caring about how I look about two months ago. Its an awful catch 22 but his lack of interest took a huge hit on my self esteem and the longer we go the worse it gets. I have never said no to sex. I give BJ’s randomly and regularly as well. Im not boring in bed (I’m a red head) and my kitty is always clean and fresh, so I really just don’t understand. We literally have zero problems in the rest of our relationship, I don’t understand what’s so unappealing about me? I don’t know where to go from here.

Am i overreacting? Or is there a problem here?",relationship_advice
t3_chg99y,My (F26) friend (F29) thought her boyfriend would propose by now and won't discuss my plans now that I am engaged,"My friend Dani has been with her boyfriend since they were 17. They had a lot of issues in the beginning, but have been a solid couple for the past few years. They have been together the longest in our friend group. Last year, our friends got engaged, and this slightly sparked something in Dani. She had said she and her boyfriend had not really discussed marriage before. They knew at some point, but hadn't had a serious conversation about it.

Then there was a tragedy in Dani's family before the new year and this really brought marriage to her priority. She brought up to her boyfriend that she wanted to be married soon, start looking at venues, everything. She then decided to start planning her bachelorette party. She had planned for an overseas trip the following year in the winter, to then be married in the spring. She approached 6 of us, asking if we'd be in for this trip for her bachelorette party. We agreed, and she made it sound like she was sure they' be engaged soon.

It has been five months since we started paying for this trip. She and her boyfriend are going on a trip this weekend and she suspected he would be proposing on it. She told us she believed he had the ring for a few months now, and we were ready to celebrate with her. However, one of our friends had a heart to heart with him, and he is very upset how hard she is pushing this. He doesn't have the money for a ring or a wedding, and has told her that repeatedly, but she won't listen. So, he wants to wait a year to save and propose. We now know he won't be proposing, but she still expects it to happen. She has also previously said to us that he had until the end of the year. We don't know how serious she is about that.

So, we've all put money towards this trip that is supposed to be a bachelorette party, that will end up not being one.

My second part:

My now fiance proposed two months ago. We were super excited and started planning immediately. We booked our venue, asked our party, and began the whole process. I started planning my bachelorette party, but she has repeatedly told me to wait another month or two before I start really planning it. It didn't make much sense to me, because our wedding is only eight months away. I don't have anything extravagant planned, but I wanted to get that booked away. I believe she is wanting me to wait so that she can have her moment of excitement of being newly engaged, have the spot light.

&amp;#x200B;

So my issues/questions:

1) How do we tell her to relax on discussing wedding plans and pushing him so hard? 

2) How can I kindly approach the fact I want to plan mine and that there is not reason to wait? It is starting to be frustrating but I don't want any arguments.",relationship_advice

t3_chqhda,My wife (30F) is overly touchy and close with her friends children to the point that I'm uncomfortable.,"All of my wife's friends have children. Not just one child but multiple. She is the Godmother to all these children and she has signed legal documents to be their legal guardian if the parents were to ever die. I was not in the picture when she did this but I do think it's not a very bright idea. Though to be fair she didn't ever believe she would get married so she never thought about how a future husband would feel.

These kids range from ages 3 to 15. Sometimes they like to come round our house for dinner or cuddle up with my wife on the couch and watch TV. She helps them with school and she often helps buy them things. If you had said she breastfed them as babies I'd totally believe it. They call her mom too even though she is just their godmother. She acts more like a devout foster mom/adopted mother than anything else. She would pretty much die for these kids.

My wife is infertile and we have been trying for 5 years with no success. She's given up wanting to try and I don't want to adopt.

I remember when I was becoming a young adult in grammar school. I never cuddled my own mom at that point. Then again ive never had a godmother or godfather so I don't know what they are exactly supposed to be doing.

I think these kids need to be weaned off her and the parents need to step up and be more parental. My wife says I'm crazy.

t3_chp9lh,"Boyfriend is on Grindr, discovered his dildos, etc","Throwaway account for this because you know why!!

TL;DR basically title, discovered boyfriend’s dildos, a single nude, gay porn searches

So earlier this year, I decide to deep clean our condo in preparation for a lovely springtime. I am mostly doing this by myself because BF works ~9 hours a day, but I like cleaning so I don’t mind. This day I did our room, and start cleaning out and organizing one of the closets. In a box with a bunch of random shit I find a grocery bag with TWO dildos, one having a remote for vibration. The year before last, he had told me he had a dildo but threw it away. This was not true. 

I should also mention we have been dating for four years, since high school. The comment about the thrown away dildo (in 2017) was the first I had ever heard of him being bi-curious. 

At the time I thought it was kind of funny and left the box be. However, curiosity had its hold over me and I snooped his phone. (I know this is bad- it wasn’t out of trustworthiness but to see what was going on with him). Anyways, I was scrolling through his recently used apps and the App Store was up in his later used apps, and had Grindr shown on it with that little cloud symbol next to it, meaning he had downloaded it at least once. 

I continue looking on his phone, not sure how to feel, and I find a recently deleted photo of his dick, that was clearly meant to send to someone else (not me, I never receive nudes from him). Look at his history on safari and see lots of intense gay porn searches. Still don’t know how I feel, however I’m not worried about him actually meeting up with anyone. 

So now we’re at current times, things have been fine no real problems. Obviously have not mentioned these things to him, as I know he will tell me on his own time. I also want to mention I have been gone for the past week volunteering. Look at his phone again tonight bc why not (sorry again). See Grindr again was being downloaded on the App Store, see gay porn searches, and really odd, see handcuff searches? He’s never once mentioned to me wanting to buy those or surprising me with them. I try to estimate when Grindr was downloaded, and it was about Saturday or Sunday, his two days off, both of which I am still gone. This is a stretch but I looked at his recently searched addresses and one of them was Kum and Go (lol I know) in our hometown, now I am wondering if he actually met a guy there??? 

I don’t know what to do. I am bisexual myself and I took my several years to figure myself out. He is only on the second year I believe of exploring his sexuality. I get not wanting to tell me- but I do not want him to be meeting up with other guys. Nudes, sexting, whatever that’s fine. But I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to reveal I’ve been looking at his phone, because obviously that’s shitty, but I don’t know about revealing the dildos either because he’s obviously not ready yet to tell me. 

I don’t know what to do!!!! (Again)!!!! Please help with advice or similar situations anyone has been in. Sorry for the formatting and long paragraphs as well, I am on my phone.

So I (M16) am with a girl, also 16, its young love, and some people frown upon that, but I'm optimistic, if that discourages you, then don't read on. I'd rather not be lectured about young love and your opinions on it.

I'm also gonna start off with saying she cheated on her ex for me, and left her ex for me, hence my insecurity on all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

So I haven't been with her for the longest time, only a couple months at this point, but I absolutely adore her, obviously. I always have done and I'm overwhelmed with happiness when I'm around her and ect ect, honeymoon period type things.However, recently she has gone on this trip which lasts around a month, and she's met people there, as people typically would and has made friends, which is not an issue for me whatsoever.

I need to start this with saying a bit about myself. Typically? I'm never jealous, I will have my moments but a tiny bit of jealousy to me shows passion and that you care. Typically I'm happy for my SO's to do as they wish, and I trust for them not to do things I'm not a fan of (obvious things I won't list such as cheating)

This time however, it's just different. They started off playing games and what not, but they were games only me and her played when we were getting close and learning about each other, not uncommon or made up games mind you, just our inside games we'd play and still do play with. Not an issue however. But then she talks about him all the time to me, like nearly constantly. Instead of talking to her half the time she gives him her phone to talk to me as if I'd like to talk to him. Then she tells me about how she went to rest her head on his shoulder, slept on his shoulder. This wouldn't be an issue but when she's done it with other people her reasoning was ""Because I was tired"" I dont mind, I get that. But with him it's because ""He was there"". Okay then I guess? Then she tells me about how she held his hand, and how she scratches his back, and then he sends me videos of her playing with his leg, as in scratching his leg up and down with her nails, rests her hand on his legs and thighs, and I'm not a fan of this. I openly said I'm not comfortable with that, and asked for her not to. She said she wouldn't but then she did it again a few days later. I again said not to do it, and she said she forgot which I tried to be understanding about and didn't give her shit for it. The next day, she sends me pictures of him with his hand on her thigh, and I let it slide, I can't be arsed with arguing, then tells me about her scratching his back, sends photos and what not, and then sends me pictures of her with her hand on her chest, things like that

I brought it up, It pissed me off and I just said ""You need to stop that shit, being so touchy with each other. I've told you I don't like it but you persist on doing it. I want to trust you but I'm finding it difficult at the moment""She just told me to fuck up and she needs space, so I've given her it. I haven't heard from her since then

&amp;#x200B;

Anytime I try to civilly talk it through, she does her hardest to avoid it (it seems that way at least)

I'll also admit, because of my past experiences, I'm not exactly mentally stable. I heavily suffer with depression which nobody wants, and I don't like her having to deal with that part of me. But she stopped me from doing things such as cutting, which I did my best to hide. she caused me to stop self harming, but because of all this? I need to take it all out so I end up hitting myself and it just causes overthinking. There is plenty more to this, but I've only mentioned the most important parts to me. I just don't know what to do. Am I overthinking all of this? Should I trust her? I fucking adore her but this shit is kind of breaking me, and I'm never usually this jealous and insecure about it, but I don't want to lose her. It's just kind of breaking me, but hey, that's young love for you. What do I do?",relationship_advice
t3_cho99o,My [26/M] EX Gf [26/F] wants me to pay for a flight change for a trip we planned while we were still dating to avoid seeing me at the airport,"So basically my now ex and I had planned a trip a couple months ago to Japan, but we recently broke up about a month ago. We had dated for 2 years and this trip was going to be done with 3 of her best friends as well. Anyways, she is now saying the thought of seeing me at the airport or on the airplane will be too much for her to handle and wants me to change my flight. 

Our trip isn't for another 2 months and I called about changing just my flight time which will cost me about $730. I am perfectly fine with going on this trip by myself while she can enjoy it with her friends, but I don't see it fair that I should pay for this fee. I suggested to her friend that my ex should be the one to pay it, but her friend didn't think that's fair. I also think it's an unnecessary expense if my ex does choose to pay it because again we are merely sharing a plane together.

While I was the one who broke up with her (for legitimate reasons that everyone accepts) I don't  think sharing a plane to Japan would be the end of the world. She won't die if she sees me, I'm not the creature from Bird Box. We can also pick seats nowhere near eachother and minimize any sightings of each other at the airport. Her friend said I should either sell my ticket, change flight times, or just forego the trip entirely because I should consider the emotional impact to my ex having to see me at the airport or on the plane. 

Personally, I would like us to just to share this flight while sitting away from each other and once in Japan we can enjoy the adventure separately. My ex and her friends are adamant that if I choose to go on this trip still during that same flight time that I am just being petty. 

TL;DR My ex wants me to pay for a flight change so she doesn't have to see me at the airport for a trip we planned whilst still dating. She is going on this trip with her friends while I am now going solo, but I don't believe this is an expense I should incur and that we should just be adults and share a plane together.",relationship_advice
t3_chp6lt,MIL going off the deep end,"For the past year or so my wife and I have been having problems with her mother.  It started about the time she started “dating” a man named Andy.  MIL would make plans with us for weeks and randomly cancel 10 minutes before and say she had to go do something with Andy.  Ok fine, I understand that.  But when we do get together with her all she does is complain how he only cares about himself, he never makes time for her or shifts his schedule around, etc.  so naturally my wife and I don’t have a high opinion of this guy ( who she has not allowed us to meet).  

Well this past year MIl has become more and more bipolar, snapping at us any time we make a negative comment about this guy.  Or she will be giddy and laughing telling us how sweet he is( but never with any sort of detail as to why).  

My MIL has digestive health issues and really had to watch what she eats and drinks, and ever since this guy is in the picture she is ignoring that and trying to eat what he eats and apparently drinking too much.

So yesterday my MIL is calling us nonstop saying she’s not feeling well, throwing up, etc.  We ask if she is eating well and she says “well I ate this and this and then Andy and I ate this and margaritas”.  We tell her lay off the junk and just eat bland food ( we her doctors orders).  

Fast forward to 11 pm that night and she is calling us saying she needs to go an ER or she is going to die.  So we rushed over and took her to one.  She was so dehydrated and sick that they gave her multiple bags of fluid and started asking questions about her health. What meds she takes, what she eats, etc.  She can’t give them 100% what she’s taking but she is on heart meds and anti depressants among other things.  She says she isn’t watching what she eats and she is drinking 2-3 drinks as well as 4-5 glasses of wine.... a DAY.  

We get her settled back at home after everything, go shopping the next morning to get her everything she should be eating, take her cat with us because she isn’t taking care of it.  And the whole time there is not one thank you or mention of us helping her.  In fact she keeps repeating how Andy told her the sweetest thing.  We asked what( rolling our eyes). And she said he told her “if you are sick call 911”.  Yeah really sweet.

Admittedly we went off on her a little harsh but basically said that she needs to start taking care of herself and also realize that this Andy guy is never around when she needs him.  

So my MIL responded by blocking both of our phone numbers.  And apparently (hearing from a friend of her) she went out the next night with this Andy guy for dinner while she was supposed to be resting.

How should we deal with this?  She needs to stop drinking so much, in fact she needs to stop period.  Any time we mention getting her help she shuts down and either leaves or hangs up.  We literally are just trying to look out for her but this guy apparently has her wrapped around his finger with no regard for her.

TLDR;  MIL won’t take care of herself and won’t let us help.",relationship_advice
t3_chqdy5,Found out my girlfriend who has been gone all summer cheated on me,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year and she got an internship this summer halfway across the country. 

Before she left for her internship at the begging of the summer we got into an argument a day before she left and did not resolve it till about a week after. 

Backstory she has a list of all the guys she’s slept with on her phone and since we have been dating I have been the last guy on it. About a month ago her friend posted a photo her with the list and I noticed a new name after mine. After seeing this I texted her confronting her about it but she said he was a guy she slept with over a year ago and just forgot to put his name down. I decided to believe her but was always skeptical about it.

Fast forward to now, I got a plane ticket to come visit her and spend the week with her. 

I would never normally do this but one night when she was asleep I decided to go through her phone just to make sure nothing happened with this guy. I saw the texts between her and her best friend where she talked about hooking up with him about a week after she started her internship. Her reasoning for it was that we were on a break but I didn’t know we were even having a break..

I decided to go through her phone more and found out she flirted with other guys through Instagram dms, and even sent her ex a nude for some weed. 

After seeing all this I woke her up and confronted her about everything and she denied it until I showed her proof of it. We talked about it for hours and she said she did it because she was mad at me and we were on a break, but realized throughout the summer that she is truly in love with me.

I love this girl with all my heart and even got a ring to propose with in the next year, but I can’t stop thinking about what happened whenever I’m with her. 

Is this something we can fix?",relationship_advice
t3_che6ga,My husband got mad at me and told me I’m a horrible wife for not having dinner ready and a clean house when he came home,"I (f, 26) have three sons who are 5, 3, and a baby with my husband (m, 29). I do everything. I work, take care of them, cook, clean, pay attention to my children, pay attention to my husband. I’ve never once asked for any help at all from him. All I want is to please him.

Well, my 5 year and 3 year old are both sick and I’m on maternity leave for the baby. 

My husband came home from work in a bad mood, and he started going in on me right away. He yelled at me about not having the dishes done, the house being messy, and not having dinner ready. Usually I come home from work and do it all quickly before he’s home, but I couldn’t because my kids were sick and I have a baby. I tried to ignore his yelling but he came into the kitchen, grabbed my arm, turned me around, and said to me, “don’t you have anything to say for yourself?”

I told him I’m really sorry and that I was taking care of them all day and I didn’t have time but I tried. 

He told me to stop making excuses.

I just was so stressed, I started to cry. And I never cry in front of him but I did. 

He asked me what I had to cry about, I told him it’s just hard. and he told me, “I can make it a lot harder for you”

I told him I’m sorry again, and he told me “sorry for what? being a horrible wife?”

I asked what he wants from me and he told me “here’s what I want from you, you’re going to quit your job and stay here all day. and you’re never gonna have me come home to this again, do you understand?”

I tried to say something but he yelled, “do you understand?”. and I said yes, then he told me to finish cleaning and then come to bed. 

I don’t understand why he doesent see everything I do for him, ive never done this before it was one time. It was really hard to have a newborn baby and two sick kids, and he just doesent see it.

t3_chp4s5,MIL trying to guilt my wife and I to leave our vacation early for a wedding,"About 8 months ago, my wife and I (both 27) booked a 7 night stay in a quiet little coastal town about 2.5 hours from home with some close friends of ours. We just moved into our first home so a week long vacation was a serious stress relief, especially for me averaging 70-80hrs work week. We are currently on that vacation with plans to drive home Saturday morning. About 3-4 months ago, while we were in the process of buying our house, we received an invitation to my wife's cousin's wedding. She RSVPd yes and didn't think anything of it until she got a text from her mother yesterday reminding us a wedding is tomorrow. We decided instead of going, we'd just give an extra gracious cash gift (~$300) as an apology for not making it. Her mother's response was as follows:

""I can't believe you wouldn't come. Family is more important. Friends come and go but family is forever. I'm extremely disappointed in you.""

This made my wife break down in tears and made me livid. In order for us to leave early, we'd have to eat the $150/night for the last night (since it's such a small town and a little family owned motel). I wouldn't be able to assist my friend in getting our boat out of the water (which is also paid through Saturday for a marina slip), we'd have to rush home, tear through boxes and boxes of clothes in hopes to find something wedding worthy, then sit in rush hour traffic to get to a 6pm full-mass wedding (neither my wife or I are religious). We don't know what to do...

t3_chqaqc,"My (22f) boyfriend (24m) is oblivious about his close female friend (24f), who's obsessed with him to an unhealthy degree.","Hi,

I (22f) have been dating my boyfriend (24m) for 15 months now.

Things between us are going great, but I'm somewhat bothered by him being too close with his female friend (24f), who's clearly into him and he seems to be somewhere between oblivious and willfully ignorant about her.

They've known each other since they were small children and have always been close.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to be clear here, I'm not the jealous type, I'm not accusing him of cheating, but I'm definitely worried about boundaries here.

It's obvious to pretty much anyone but him, that she has been orbiting him since forever. When he was single even his mom asked him why they never tried. 

He's still going with ""It's more like brotherly love"" and I think that he's genuine about that, but at some point he has to accept the truth about the nature of their relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

She has moved a few years back and now lives about 2 hours away, but literally never misses an opportunity to meet him, she jumps every single time as soon as he wants her to. He only does this for her if it's something actually important, but she would drop other friends just because he asked if she was available.

When spending the night at his place she tried things like looking for lame excuses like an 'uncomfortable couch' to sleep in the same bed, but he shut that down, because he knows that I wouldn't approve. Apparently he didn't always do this in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

He says that she has always been cuddly and a bit overly attached and I get that it might appear differently to him when this obsession slowly developed over the span of their lives, but even friends of mine who only met her a few times instantly told me to keep an eye on her.

I know that some of her previous boyfriends had issues with her behavior as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Another point I'm worried about is oversharing.

She has always been his emotional support friend, he says that he feels more comfortable about sharing with her than with his male friends. They even discuss their relationship issues and sex lives.

I'm not even bothered by the latter, good she knows that I fuck his brains out, but talking about relationship issues in that constellation could be potentially dangerous. 

There aren't indications that she abuses her position, but I could easily see how she might if we started having more serious issues.

&amp;#x200B;

While I would probably prefer it, I know he wouldn't drop his life long friend even if I wanted him to.

I trust him, I never got any suspicious vibes from him in this regard, but I want him to see and admit how things truly are.

This isn't healthy and while I don't care about her wellbeing, he does and he should see that this can't be good for her mental health and future potential relationships.",relationship_advice
t3_chqae7,my (20F) boyfriend (20M) might still think he's more attractive than I am and it's tough on my self worth,"Having issues with my (20 F) boyfriend (20M) of about a year and a half. We started out our relationship as friends in college and while we were friends he told me about how much he liked a female friend he went to high school and now we all go to the college with but she wasn't into him. Not long after we started dating I was joking around and said that I felt like the 'reacher' rather than the 'settler' because he was so great, and to my surprise he agreed that I was the reacher and that he could do better (not in those words exactly). He said as a justification that his female friend (the one that he had been interested in) said he could do better than me. Obviously this caused some crying and a bit of a fight but he resolved it saying he didn't mean it and it was just and automatic response to agree with me. 

Fast forward a while, our relationship has had a few bumps but overall pretty good. Throughout the past year or so I have realized I really do love him and he is (almost always) incredibly sweet and good to me. He still hangs out with said female friend (but we've talked about how sometimes it makes me jealous/uncomfortable), but I also have become pretty good friends with a guy from class. He voiced some concern about the guy so I offered that I could spend less time with him or have all of us hang out more or do something to make it better. my boyfriend doesn't spend that much time with his female friend but when I get jealous he usually reassures me that I have nothing to worry about and that he loves me (which works). clearly we both have some issues with jealousy but we are pretty good about communicating and helping each other. 

After the last time he went to go catch up with his friend from high school, I told him afterwards some of the doubts I've been having about our relationship (aside from jealousy issues, we've been working a lot and things feel 'off'. It's scary to me that we are very young to be so deeply committed to each other) and also that thinking about this female friend brings up a lot of insecurity about him thinking he's more attractive than I am and that he could do better (not a new fight). At one point during our conversation, he said that at the time of the whole 'I can do better' fight, he was being honest and that it was stupid and based on looks alone and he doesn't think he can do better than me. He said this in an attempt to make me feel better, saying that now he thinks the world of me because he has gotten to know me more. of course it didn't make me feel better. As much as I wish I didn't care what he thought about how attractive I am and cared that he values other things about me, it still bothered me a LOT to hear him say that. he also brought up that maybe I'd like a break (he clarified that he didn't) but I said that as far as I know breaks are like a baby step for breakups. Not sure if it would be a good idea or not. 

Not that it really matters, but I think I am attractive and typically I'm not insecure about my looks. When I go out with friends people will hit on me and my girlfriends are really supportive and remind me how good of a person I am but also how pretty I am. generally I don't have an issue with confidence, but this situation with my boyfriend will come up occasionally and it is difficult for me to deal with. I do love him and 99% of the time he is amazing and makes me feel like a great person and very beautiful and all that good stuff. I just really don't know how to deal with this situation that comes up very rarely and would really appreciate some advice!

Me (M30) and my wife (M30) know each other for 15 years now, but only been together for the last 2. In short, we've been  highschool sweethearts, really liked each other but never did anything about it because we were really shy. After 13 years without contact, we crossed paths again and started dating.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were amazing, and after 1 year, we got married :) Im very, very happy with her by my side, and really think that she's the love of my life, and i feel it in her the same way, she always texts me cute messages, sex is great, we're best friends inside a marriage. I always try to do new things to with her, really cherish our relationship and work hard to not let it stall or get into a routine. I really think of myself as a good husband, she's the main priority in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

But around 3 months ago, some small things started to change, and i can't stop worrying about it. The cute texts stopped, now she only send cute messages as a respond if i send her first. The sex is still great, but when it happens (none for the past 2 weeks now), and im starting to think she's sad, depressed in fact. I tried several times to let her know that im there for her, try to sit her down and ask if everything is ok, but the response is always ""yes, why?"". And, the last 2 times that i try to say that im worried because somethings aren't normal, she responded really badly and now i don't know if i say something anymore or just go with it. The perception i have of her is that shes not happy, and im trying my best to figure it out or at least know that if its me, work, or anything else is happening.

I always thought that in a marriage, you're supposed to talk if things are going south, but now im scared to say something and make things worse. And with no conversation, i think things will get even badder. I need help, what should i do?

My boyfriend worked for four years in the nightlife industry in Vegas. Because of that he has a lot of friends who are pornstars, strippers, webcam girls etc. I didn't know him during that time in his life. We live in California now, and he no longer works in that industry, but his Instagram feed is still full of sexual pics of all these hot girls with little and sometimes nothing on. Tbh I don't mind that he follows the people he knows personally. But he follows a lot of other girls with same sexual content, fake asses and tits, and honestly it feels like a slap in the face. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough. I know I'm not as hot as them but I take care of myself and I look good. I (21) should also mention that he is only 30 and refuses sex more often than not because he's 'too tired'. If I'm lucky we have sex once a week, while he jerks off in the shower every morning. Meanwhile he constantly comments how hot other girls are and jokes about going to strip clubs and smashing his face into titties and asses. 
Basically, I feel like shit. More like his mom, who does his laundry, gives him massages, and fixes his suits. I asked him why he's with me when he could have any of those girls from Vegas. He replied 'because he sees something different in me.' and he supposedly sees a future with me. While that seems like exactly what I should want to hear, I feel like shit that I am not what he lusts after. To be honest, I would almost rather be one of those sex bombs than the potential 'good little wife' I seem to be.

t3_chq1g5,My girlfriend is always super rude to me when she gets drunk. How should i deal with this?," 

My girlfriend (23F) is really rude to me (24M) when she gets drunk. It honestly feels like I’m dating a 16 year old. Last night was by far the worst. We are preparing to move across country next week so there is a lot to get done to pack up all of our stuff. Her team at work has just completed a large project and an event was organized to celebrate (concerning to me as every time her work group goes to celebrate I see the same behaviour from her). So as to no surprise this time around, as I spend the entire evening packing up our kitchen, she was out getting absolutely wasted. At around 10pm I hadn’t heard from her in 3 hours. I decided to go for a 20 min run and let her know via text and that I wouldn’t be bringing my phone. I come back from my run to see a bunch of angry messages from her saying “how could you not bring your phone while I’m out drinking?” and that she wanted me to come pick her up.

So I try to call and text her to see where she is so I can come get her but she is totally ignoring my calls/texts. It’s about 10:30 now and I’m feeling exhausted and just want to go to bed, we have to work in the morning and still have a lot to prepare for our move. Over the course of a few hours I wait and continue to do some packing, occasionally trying to call her text her and all I get is some hang ups on the phone. She did answer it once to tell me she was going to a different bar down the street (at midnight) and when I told her it was time to come home she just said she had to go and hung up on me. I could clearly tell she was very drunk.

So I have no idea where she actually is and she stops answering any of my calls/texts. So I go to bed. 2am rolls around and she calls me for a ride. I go pick her up and as she usually is, she’s so rude to me. In my mind I’m understandably frustrated with how the night has gone but she’s so drunk and repeatedly calls me a selfish a\*\*h\*\*\*. She starts telling me my job is a joke and keeps going on and on about how great her work group is, how she got offered a job from a drunk old rich guy who is one of their clients, etc. She refuses to go in the house when we get home because apparently I’m still being an a\*\*h\*\*\*. She eventually passes out in the car, I try to carry her into the house but she wakes up and starts freaking out on me saying I’m hurting her.

We finally get into the house and all she has to say as she walks by the numerous boxes that I’ve packed that evening is “looks like you did f\*\*\* all tonight, literally.” At this point I just can’t believe what’s going on and I start crying and all she says to me is that I’m a f\*\*\*ing joke before she passes out in bed.

This is not the first time that this behavior has happened. It happens every time she goes out drinking without me. And she always gets super drunk. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to say I don’t want my girlfriend to go out and have a good time, her team really did deserve to celebrate after completing the project, but I just can’t take the way she treats me when I pick her up. Not only does she not appreciate at all that I came to pick her up at 2am and spent my whole evening packing while she was drinking, she’s just so rude to me. And we’ve talked about it before but she always plays it off like it’s not a big deal and that she’s sorry and was just drunk. I’m just so broken, I feel like she’s just a totally different person in these situations and it’s hard for me to believe she’s my girlfriend. I don’t know what to do. I know she never acts or says these things sober, but I don't even understand where these thoughts come from when she's drunk.",relationship_advice
t3_chll3c,My (28M) BF suddenly wants premarital counseling before he proposes to me...? (23F),"We have been together for two years.

My proposal isn't really a secret and I know it's happening next month. BF randomly woke me up yesterday at 12AM to demand we go to premarital counseling. Was really caught off guard. We haven't had any huge arguments in the last few months. I don't mind going, but he hasn't really said why he wants to go. He won't ask me to marry me him if I don't go. He already goes to a therapist on his own and he recently saw her.

All he said was: It's his fault for not putting his foot down and letting me walk all over him? Said we needed more boundaries.

This is new to me, and the first that I'm hearing he feels this way. He offers to help me with a lot of things (chores, making my plate for dinner, gassing up my car) and I never turn down the help. I do ask for simple things like this from him but I didn't know it was annoying him that bad. I do much of the same for him without him asking, because he shouldn't have to ask. If I know something needs to be done, I just do it. This isn't a one sided relationship. We both work and contribute equally to our finances and home.

I asked if we could go through with the proposal and make an appointment the week after for therapy. He said no. 

I'm kind of at a loss. I've been extremely anxious at work for the last 48 hours. He's been sleeping on the couch. Will barely say two words to me. This happened out of nowhere and I really don't know what to do or say. I wouldn't be so freaked out if he just told me what the issue is but he is being extremely vague.

I don’t have much income at the moment, he has a great job that pays well and can support us both comfortably. Money is never mentioned unless we have an argument in which “I pay for everything” or “I’m the only person helping you” comes out. He is a great man, but often blunt and honest which can come across rude and insensitive. He tends to repeat negative and hurtful sentences when conversations turn touchy-  today it was about my new business plans! It turned negative after i excitedly told him my ideas and he replied with ""they weren’t working and your business is failing""  I’m not in a good place in general, emotionally and he knows this however it didn’t warrant him to think to reword how he says/said things to me. As he watched me get more emotional he gets more frustrated “ugh god fuck sake, ITS NO WORKING” and repeats everything again to explain himself. “I said your business is failing because it is! Thats the truth! Im being negative because there is nothing positive about this situation, your business is failing, you stuff should be flying off the shelves now!""  
\- I just want plain support, especially after i’ve told you about the positive plans for the future of the business. Just negative comment after negative comment, with the occasional helpful(?) comment like ""Why aren't you getting professional marketing help? Go to some classes!"" Of course by then we are both raising our voices and turns out i'm already looking into classes. ""I paid for this business so i should have a say""  It was all a bit much and i got upset, it didn't feel like he was helping me which he said he was...  


We go round in circles and all i want is to clear the air and have him say sorry i know its a touchy subject, i didn’t mean to make it negative or whatever, but he won’t apologise. He says i just have an inability to talk about anything serious, and yes im emotional, but is it so much to ask that you speak to me with that in mind? Could you be encouraging instead of negative and suffocating? Can't you tell you're upsetting me when there is no need? I completely don't understand where that came from?? Its like he just decided he was going to take this negative route.  
“im HELPING you and this is how you treat me, i will not stand for this. I have never helped anyone MORE in my life”  
Sorry seems to be a really hard word for him to say, but if its black and white, he’ll apologise, like when he smacked my best friends ass.  But if we can argue about something (semantics/unclear), by god he’ll fucking do it. For me, sorry is not a hard word to say. Making someone cry would make me apologise and/or reword, i don’t want to make someone upset so I don’t understand why he can’t do the same???? Im his wife aren’t I? :’(    


When I try to explain my upset he gets incredibly defensive and he throws whatever at me to deflect from the situation. He’ll say im twisting his words and i’m not remembering correctly, it gets vicious and i get hysterical and hurt myself. Once he made fun of my panic attack- “How can i help you when you’re over here shaking like this” (shakes violently with a stupid face) it was so hurtful. I don’t do this for attention, i just work myself up because i want him to understand what i’m saying is JUST PLEASE BE KINDER TO ME but he just can’t understand and argues with me. I sit upstairs crying trying not to hurt myself and i know he hears me but he’s too busy watching TV totally unbothered while Its all I can focus on.   
I have never felt so reduced as a person so weak and pathetic. This happens often.  
 

I’ve felt different about him. How can this be my husband? Why isn’t he there for me when I’m hurting or he sees his words are hurting me? WORDS have weight. When you say I love you I believe you, when you say hurtful things, i believe you until you apologise or attempt to fix the situation. So be honest and kind, Is that so hard to do?  
Any words of wisdom or encouragement would be appreciated. I don’t know what to do,  Am i being completely crazy and overly sensitive??",relationship_advice

I do not have a college degree so I am very grateful that I was offered this position, as I realize they are hard to come by without higher education/qualifications/etc. I am the lowest on the totem pole here, which is fine, but my boss (we will call her Mary) is really headstrong and talks down to me because I am a liberal.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I come from is very different than where I live now. My parents are super conservative but I am from a mostly liberal/democratic city, and where I live now is the polar opposite... Mostly everyone here is extremely conservative, love guns/military/Fox News/whatever. I don't assert my opinions on anyone in general, and I'm by no means a ""radical"" liberal if that makes any sense? I don't want to create problems in social settings ever and like I said, my parents are conservative so I grew up with their opinions...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my boss has recently taken on the position of Office Manager and the power seems to have gotten to her head a bit. She can be really rough and kind of mean. I think my kindness has been mistaken for weakness. This morning she went off at me about Trump, and how he is the best president, and all we liberals want is socialism (???) and that Biden is a ""creep"", that Michelle Obama is a man and has an Adam's apple??? -- just really baseless stuff ( a lot that I hear all the time). I seldom speak up, but it's really gross and I don't know how to politely ask her to please stop bringing up politics because she knows I am a liberal and I feel she is antagonizing me and trying to get me riled up.

&amp;#x200B;

I speak my mind hardly ever and I don't appreciate being put down over my views. I don't like being called names like Lib-tard, snowflake, etc. I just want people to be respectful, I am a pacifist and don't agree with war/violence/whatever. I don't know what I am supposed to say because I am sort of afraid of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

We don't have HR, and I don't know our General Manager well enough to say anything. The owner of the company ironically is liberal as well and casually gives Mary shit when he's here, but I don't think it would be appropriate to bring him into this. Does anyone have some advice how I can stand up for myself?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Boss is super pro-Trump, I am not. She antagonizes me and patronizes me for having different political views, even though I say nothing and do nothing to provoke her. She takes out her anger about liberals on me, someone totally non-threatening and harmless. Too nervous/afraid to talk to higher-ups at this time, she is mean and kind of scary.

t3_chph9v,Should I tell my (21F) ex-boyfriend’s (21M) new girlfriend (18F) that he is still contacting me and trying to sleep with me?,"My boyfriend of 5 years was very abusive to me and so when I was a safe distance from him I broke things off with him. This was 2 years ago and since then he has on multiple occasions contacted me on different platforms, jumping to the next one a while after being blocked, trying to get back with me. He has sent unsolicited nudes, threats of rape, attempted bribes to get me to sleep with him, begging for me back etc.

It died down for almost a full year and I had to practically change my entire identity online. Different name, usernames, being too afraid to post images of myself and the like. I’m going to therapy every week for the PTSD he has given me.

But recently he found my instagram and started it back up, asking to meet up and sleep together as before. I was about to just block him as usual until I saw that he is now in a relationship with someone else. I’ve been sitting on this unsure of what to do. I’ve tried to ask people IRL and was told to drop it and that she won’t believe me even with screenshots. This is purely assumption though as none of them know her at all. 

So, how should I go from here? Should I inform her or just drop it and move on?

t3_chpdww,What do you do when your father is not medically safe to come home from the hospital after a surgery but is refusing all treatment and physical therapy?,"My step father (70M) is an alcoholic, fall risk, anorexic and currently in the hospital recovering from a tumor removal in his mouth.

He is being discharged from the hospital today and has refused all treatment to include rehab, physical therapy and occupational therapy. We were planning an intervention at the hospital tonight but are now unable to do so. Can my mom refuse to pick him up? What will happen? What can she do tell the doctors he’s unsafe to come home? She is not capable of being his caretaker and he refuses to allow a nurse in to the home. He’s basically slowly killing himself while expecting to be waited on hand and foot.

t3_chpdsa,Wife(36F) was dismissive of my(37M) hobby in conversation and it kind of hurt,"Don't know if I want advice per se, or just to vent. 

TL;DR I shared stuff about my hobby, wife said it's boring, I told her I'm just trying to talk to her about anything

That out of the way...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really into 3D printing right now - I like working on the really technical stuff on 3D printers (like customizing firmware and fine tuning the machine). I'll admit I get into these super technical explanations when I talk about it. I try not to.

My wife is not into it like I am. I respect that. I don't expect her to be into it the same way, or at all. 

The other night while laying in bed and winding down, she's zoned out on her phone again - it's the default each of us take if we've got nothing to do. She works 12+ hours a day, so I miss her and just want to talk to her or watch a show. She's not interested in watching anything at the time (or it didn't seem like it), so I just tried talking to her about anything. My work isn't good and most of the time it's just complaints, so I talked about my hobby. 

I was about maybe two minutes into this when she cuts me off. I can tell she's trying to be gentle, but she's practical so a lot of times it comes out coarse. She tells me that she's trying to listen to what I'm saying, but it's so boring that she can't pay attention. 

This hurt and upset me a bit because she didn't pause to stop playing whatever mindless phone game it was that she was playing to listen, or to tell me this. 

So I told her that I miss her and I just want to talk to her, about anything. I told her I know that my stuff isn't her interest but I was hoping she'd change the subject to literally anything that interests her so we can talk about that instead. I was basically just using my topic as a (admittedly lame) icebreaker. 

She went back to silently playing her game for, I dunno, a couple hours before sleeping. She stays up past me so I don't know how long she's up. I gave up and just went to sleep, hoping that I'd get over it if I slept on it. 

Before I get the kneejerk - I'm pretty sure she's not cheating on me. She's a practical person. The money I make isn't enough to keep her if it came down to it. It's been demonstrated before that if she wanted to leave me, she just would, and there wouldn't be a lot I can do about it. At the same time, it's things like this that make me feel like she's not really engaged in our relationship either. We meaningfully interact maybe twice a week, and the rest of the time is work, kids and sleep. This isn't because of the lack of time; she'd just rather do something else with her free time than something with me. I get that she's tired, but I wish that she wanted to spend time with me with that spare time once in a while. 

So am I being an oversensitive crybaby about this?",relationship_advice

t3_chp6cn,"After 3 years of dating and almost a year of living together, me (26m) and my partner (24f) are going to be living apart because I'm miserable living with their family. Did I make a mistake in deciding this?","TL;DR: I was miserable living with my SO's parents and had to leave, even if it meant putting physical distance between myself and my love, but still feel very conflicted.

The title is kind of a mess, sorry, I'm not very good at titling.

Anyways, for some background, my partner and I met 3 years ago on OkCupid and decided to go on a date. They were a student who normally lived 3 hours away but were attending college in my hometown. Our first date went well and eventually we went into a relationship.

Fast forward about a year ago and my SO is on their last semester and moving into a newer, larger apartment. They ask if I want to live with them, knowing that I am unemployed and have been for a year or two. Neither of us have income, SO has everything paid for by their family, who they tend to have a very rocky relationship with, and I was living with my parents. The plan was that I would get a job and we could save up for something else eventually.

This works well for the college semester but neither of us having savings by the end and we're barely scraping by. SO suggests moving in with their parents to save money. I'm a little unsure but I love my SO and don't want to be apart so I agree.

Now, however, I'm very unsure. Remember how I said my SO had a rocky relationship with their family? Well that's because their family is, by both of our admissions, assholes. Everyone yells at everyone, no one wants to work together and after I quit a job I had for about two weeks due to severe depression, everyone hated me. By Sunday of this week, I couldn't take it anymore. I was having reccuring thoughts of harming myself or others and was severely depressed. I felt trapped in my SO's bedroom and didn't even feel safe in there as anyone could barge in and yell at us at anytime. (And in fact SO's brother did just that a week before and insulted me for driving for Uber while looking for a new job.) To top it all off, we weren't saving any money at all anyways because SO's mom wanted both of us to pay $100 a month, which we had been doing.

I talk to my Mom and ask them for advice and they suggest I should come home and clear my head for a bit. I give it some thought and I agree. I'm unemployed, severely depressed, have no savings, have some minor debt I cannot pay and have no health insurance. I feel like my life is a mess and I feel bad for trying to save up for a life for the both of us when I can't even get my own straight.

I tell my SO this and at first they take it well, saying that they understand, but then we both get really sad. I really worry for my SO because their home life is toxic as hell and they have nowhere else to go. We were both planning on going back to the apartment to clean it up before the lease ends but my SO is sick the day we wanted to leave so they stay behind and follow me down the next day. Since then, they've been crying a lot, saying how much they're going to miss me and that long distance relationships suck. And I agree, I wish it didn't have to be like this, but I feel like I'm a mess and need to get myself sorted.

So I come to ask for advice and thoughts. I feel like I'm making the right decision but I'm so emotionally torn because I love my SO and don't want to be apart. But I absolutely hate living with their parents and it made me miserable.",relationship_advice

What I am going to say happened a few years back and I was not in a position mentally or in any capacity to do anything about it but here is what is happening again.  My H drinks far too much, on the weekend he will stay up almost all night.  A few times I've woken in the middle of the night and hes not home.  I get the excuse I went out to visit so and so (umm at 1am) and your drinking not safe or supposedly he walks to neighborhood.  Frankly I'm done and think this is not behavior of someone married with kids and hes in his early 40s (and had same behavior most of relationship)  also as an aside we live in a family home that needed a major overhaul and it's in complete disarray (picture the worst frat house you have ever been in) I'm almost 40 and dont want to live like that and I have tried to no avail.

t3_chje8n,Should I tell my kids to avoid the family of a disabled kid because of their behavior problems?,"Backstory: long time friends’ son (high school age) lost a limb in an accident (A). “A” touches everyone around him aggressively: hugging without asking, tackling, forced wrestling, arm around necks, poking, he has no concept of personal space with anyone. He is emotionally needy and tends to get belligerent and violent if he doesn’t get his way. 

“A” recently assaulted one of his siblings at a public event and had to be physically restrained. He called his mother and lied to her about the events leading up to him attacking sib. (My kids witnessed, but were not involved in any way.) 

A’s Mom lashed out and, on the phone with her kids, accused all of the group there of “bullying” “A,” saying the only reason why he would have attacked his sibling is because the group was conspiring against him and sibling was the easiest target. 

“A” and his siblings have similar behavior issues. The best way of describing them is like they’re on the ASD spectrum... but without the sound and touch sensitivity issues, instead being completely opposite: loud, bombastic and overly tactile. They seem odd or awkward, but are of average intelligence. Everywhere they go they are like a force of nature.

Their parents scapegoat their kids’ poor behavior onto anyone surrounding them. Mom makes passive aggressive Facebook “call out” posts in which no one is named, but it’s crystal clear who she is talking about and gets hundreds of BS sympathy comments for her “bullied kids.” As far as I can tell, there have been no true cases of them being bullied by anyone. 

“A”s parents are community leaders, have lots of money, and involve themselves in too much. The family is scheduled from 7a to 10p nearly every day during the school year. They’re the type of people who think they have to be in charge of everything. They also have expectations that their children should be high achieving like they are, but don’t seem to see that they really ought to pull back FOR their family instead of doggedly pushing them to do too much and not being present for them. They love their meticulously scheduled “quality time” but didn’t get the memo that kids primarily need QUANTITY time from their parents.

“A” has very few friends. His personality and behavior make it difficult and unpleasant. Most peers actively avoid him. His siblings do somewhat better, but I am getting weary of trying to defend my kids every time their mom goes on the warpath. “A” lied that my son said he wasn’t coming to his birthday party even though he was. I got angry texts from mom, I calmed her down. Best I can tell, “A” loves playing victim because he gets special attention from mom. (Gee, ya think??) Then their kids loudly proclaim to mine that their parents badmouth our family. 

I really don’t want these kids to be friendless. But it’s so tiring. Is it just best to avoid them, or soldier through for the kids sake despite their parents that can’t see THEM, only ideals of them?

TLDR: My kids are friends with the kids of a family with a disabled kid, but their constant behavior problems are wearing us down. Their parents either don’t see their kids’ issues, or actively deflect them onto everyone else.",relationship_advice
t3_chp2gx,I feel like a third wheel in my own relationship.,"I [26M] have been dating my girlfriend [23F] for just shy of 6 months now, things overall are going great. When I hang out with her and my longtime friend, A [26M], he devotes ~80% of his attention/conversation to her. The first time they met months ago she said he looked at her like he hasn’t gotten any in a while (Im pretty sure this was true and might still be). The first few times hanging out I teased her about it “___ is into you, talk to him until I get back [from the bathroom at a bar]”, because he focused almost all of his attention and conversation to her.

When we hang out now he directs about 70% of his conversation to her, occasionally making eye contact with other people, but we almost might as well not be there. Last night, this was the case, but generally all of us were part of it (another one of my friends B was there, 26M), but as the night progressed it became as if it was just my gf and A, and B and I were not even there. I tried to make a few remarks but noticed that A wouldn’t stop talking, and it appeared my gf had ignored me too, albeit A was literally talking in her face.

My gf is very quiet, as am I, and she said she likes that about me, and that some guys just don’t stfu. However, once someone gets her talking she has a lot to say and will keep going as long as they do.

My friend A can talk to literally anybody about anything for any amount of time, he just keeps pulling stuff out of his @$$ to say.

So, it feels that he much more interesting than I am, and monopolizes her attention to the point where she almost ignored me. However she has told me that she could never date someone like him for many reasons when I first mentioned it made me a little uncomfortable a while ago. Obviously they are friendly and A is a cool person to hang with, and she’s a little shy so she likes having someone to talk to if she doesn’t know anyone else besides me (This is the first time she met B, who is also mildly reserved). It’s starting to get really annoying to the point where I don’t want to hang out with my gf and A at the same time, but I don’t have a ton of friends in town anymore that I spend as much time with as I do A. I also fear that he is more entertaining and engaging for her than I am and can’t help but think it’s possible she’d choose him over me, but I think that’s my insecurities snowballing on themselves.

What do I say to gf, or A?",relationship_advice
t3_chmzbu,Should I hate my Aunt and Uncle after they manipulated my grandma into giving them everything?,"My uncle(49m) has been living in a trailer on my grandmas property his entire life. Never paid rent. He met his wife 8 years ago and now they have a 5 year old. 

He hasn’t been able to work in years because he had a heart attack and she can’t hold down a job for more than 2 months. So my grandma has been paying all of their bills and whatever else. 

My grandpa and grandma had a will they made 20 years ago stating that their house and property was to be sold and all of the money should be split evenly between all of their children.

After my grandpa died a year ago, my uncle and aunt wanted to help my grandma draft a new will. My mother(the oldest child) was fine with it as she trusted my uncle.

Turns out my uncle and aunt changed the will so that they get everything when she passes away and when my uncle passes away it all goes to my aunt. They get the house and the property and all of their savings. They said they deserve it because they’ve been “taking care of her” all these years but my grandma gets regular visits from my whole family. 

WE DONT CARE ABOUT THE MONEY. My parents are well off and I have my own career.

t3_choyke,How to either move past/ talk to my girlfriend about something that makes me a uncomfortable?,"So let me start of by saying my (21M) gf (19F) is amazing. I love spending time with her and she is always so much fun to be around. For three of the first four months of our relationship, I was constantly busy with school/applying to med school, and she was always super supportive towards me. I just find that I’m always happier when I’m around her. The past couple of months have been rough on her and I’ve tried to be as supportive to her as she’s been to me. 

The only thing that makes me feel uncomfortable is some her friends. As an example; one of her best friends, let’s call him A, is someone that I haven’t really spent much time around. I’ve met him, but that’s about it. However my gf always knows everything about what is going on in his life, like everything. And she’ll also joke along the lines of them being married. She once made a comment about how she could never date him, but it just seems odd to me for her to talk about him like that, especially to me, when we’re dating. Like, I’m her boyfriend and she’ll joke about them being an old married couple, to me. I’m not the controlling or jealous type, and I do trust her. I’m totally fine with her going out with her friends without me or doing whatever when I’m not there. I never feel the need to monitor her for anything other than making sure she’s safe. But for some reason it just makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable. It’s unlike me and I don’t know how to feel about it. 

She’s also not the type to talk about past relationships or anything like that. So I’m not sure she’d tell me if there was something between them, briefly, before she met me. I don’t think there’s anything like cheating going on here, like I said I trust her. I just don’t know what do to. Do I let her know? Is it more of a personal hangup that I need to work through? I just don’t like it and wanted some other opinions. Thanks ahead of time",relationship_advice

t3_chmxu6,I(30M) recently started a new career and I am completely not sure what the f*** am I doing. My GF(27F) is sometimes not very helpful sometimes...,"Recently, I have shifted to IT as my new career. Now I am a programmer, which means I will take a lot of time in my day to perfect my skills or to learn new. It is what it is, I knew it from the day one when the decision was made, so was my girlfriend very aware of the fact that my job will be more time consuming than previous jobs I've had. In fact, 10 months prior to my new employment, after 9-5 job, I would work on my programming skills to get me employed. That generally shifted our relationship towards the time where I don't have time for nonsense stuff. Netflixing all day isn't the option I can take. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am going to be busy to learn as much as I can in a day, but also, I am constantly bashing my head with the ""imposter syndrome"" as my colleagues are outperforming. Even though I try really hard, sometimes my output isn't as good as I thought it would be. I genuinely deliver what's asked from me, but not the way I would want to deliver because there is really a lot to learn, it is a huge field with a lot of stuff you have to chew in order to spit it out the right way. So, after 5, I usually go to the gym to blow off the steam that's in me. After the gym, I feel really relaxed and I am good to learn some more. So what I do is come home, cook some dinner, and then proceed to learn where I left. And that's most of the time last 3 months. Occasionally I'd stay at work one day in a week to work late, with colleagues on our pet projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

What generally kills me is the fact I have become like more 'mechanical'. In our 4 year relationship,  I was terrible with expressing my feelings in general, but now I can't even say how I feel. And that thing generally kills my GF. Another thing is, personally, my goals are set high and I don't want to lower them. On the other hand, she would love to travel. Short story, she's working mentally demanding job in one tech company, but she doesn't have the need to learn out of the work as her job is not of that kind as mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So what is the issue here?** 

&amp;#x200B;

First one is she is dreaming about traveling, while I am dreaming about getting my shit and my career to the point that I can relax for about 4-5 years. Having that said, I am going to sacrifice at least 2 years of my life, so eventually I get to the point I am satisfied. Eventually, I would love to explore the world in a business sense, which means relocating to other companies/countries, possible far away from Europe, while she's consistent with the idea of staying here where we are. I love to work, I have a dream to become a successful entrepreneur, while she has different dreams, and I generally respect her. I have 30 years so I don't have so much time to fuck around.

&amp;#x200B;

Second would be my mental and physical health. Well, I have had a history of drug abuse, alcohol, and other things. Procrastination is also something I am trying to fight off on a daily basis. I generally don't like the idea of going back, so here and there I would try to be disciplined in order to achieve everything I have on my schedule for the day. Well, sometimes I can't do that because she will be angry with my ideas. I cut drugs 7 years ago, and at the beginning of the year, I cut the alcohol. It will cause me severe headaches, and sometimes other problems, so my idea was to kill that habit. Cold turkey. And I did, successfully. I feel great about it, as I know how to have fun without the booze, and she's pissed on me as we knew to get drunk on Fridays and Saturdays to the point we could barely talk. This year we had a lot of 'family' meetings, and here is normal to drink till you get wasted. She was really determined for me to get wasted as she wanted, but I said that alcohol is not an option for me as I try to maintain the life without any vices. Also, I am kind of encouraging her to do the same as I feel the benefits, like not being a couch potato, doing shit that matter and etc., but she'd get all defensive about it, so eventually, I have to shut up as she'd be pissed about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The third is money. It will seem as I am petty, but I have been working since my 15, and I love the fact my life is modest, no matter how big the marketing and influencing pressure is. I have my 'techie things' - a few gadgets. Nothing expensive, and I love it that way.  I worked my ass off before her and during our relationship and I appreciate money, as well as I am aware of the expenses. I do have some savings, but that flowed out since I was the only one paying the rent for 5 months, and basically all expenses. 

The thing that is killing me is a mutual savings account, designed for leisure. I know finances and understand that in terms to grow the savings, I will have to invest the money somewhere so later on in life I can get a mortgage, but her idea is to travel now. Save money and travel. Although I would love to travel and spend money on leisure, my idea is different. I would rather enjoy traveling when I'd be older, and/or traveling for/with work. So generally I have no idea what should I do with that part, as I can't explain that this is generally not my style and right now, when I can work the most, I see it as a waste of potential investment. And that's one of the biggest things she seems to have a problem with. Also, sometimes I get the feeling she thinks that is entitled to my hard-earned money. Meaning, your money is mine as well, while where I have to earn my money, and knowledge, it's my fault I am not taking care and share feelings with her on the sofa. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the stuff mentioned above is not something that is 'relationship breaker', at least not at the moment. To be honest, I am pretty much okay with everything, but from time to time she likes to put an emphasis on these three things mentioned. **Job, drinks, travel/leisure**. Which is not okay as I am working my ass off to have a better life in the future. Sometimes she over-reacts and threatens with a break-up, but then I say that this is not a valid reason to do that, or calm the situation somehow. At the beginning of the relationship, I was a borderline alcoholic, so I had some shenanigans while intoxicated, at a very early stage, but now, when our relationship is more mature it is not common to see that kind of behavior. Especially when it is time to pull our shit up and work it as best as we can.

&amp;#x200B;

What is some general advice you would give for me, overcoming the programming obstacles in life? What would be your next step after reading this? I need something to see if I am maybe too dull to make a clear decision because of all the work, or I am just super chill with the situation. I dunno... assist somehow... Because from time to time I get fed up with all the bullshit and I want to go someplace else where I'd have my own peace and time to work on myself and my skills and career....

t3_chmvh1,My [33/m] girlfriend [31/f] claims the way I managed a breakup 15 years ago contributes to her insecurity and consequent outbursts. Is this fair?,"When I was 19, I landed in a relationship with a girl (Nancy) that I had been long term friends with after sleeping together a couple of times and her deciding to refer to me as her bf. I was never super into her and after a month had met someone else (Annie) that I was genuinely into. Annie lived down the hall from me and was established in my friend group. After a few drunken group nights of mutual flirting, she tried to kiss me on 2 separate occasions. I pulled away both times and told her I had to break up with Nancy first which she accepted.

When I went to break up with Nancy after 2 months total, I found out her best friend had dropped out of university and had moved back to her hometown and Nancy was extremely upset. I decided to be considerate and wait for a better time, which turned into about a month after more drama in her personal life. I never did anything physical with Annie while I was still with Nancy, but did spend time with her in group settings and occasionally alone together when walking back from University etc where I gave her updates about the Nancy situation.

My current girlfriend (Nina) was cheated on quite brutally before me and has issues with my contact with most other girls. I've never done anything to betray her trust, except not give her full access to my phone on demand which she believes she should have the right to because she's happy to give me access to hers. After 8 months she still has trust issues and reacts aggressively to any perceived female threat.

Last night she told me that the way I dealt with Nancy and Annie was morally wrong and is something that contributes to her insecurity and consequent reactions. She says I should have cut all contact with Annie until I had broken up with Nancy. I feel like my actions were morally right because I had to choose the lesser of 2 evils and cutting all contact would have been a major overkill given we lived so close and had the same friend group. 

Am I right to defend my actions in a moral context?",relationship_advice

He’s always smiling at my and always tries to talk to me with every chance he’s got. At first I thought he was just being friendly until he started getting more bold. A few days ago he called me gorgeous and asked if we could be friends on Facebook. Ever since then he’s been messaging me on Facebook about how my days have been going and how sweet he thinks I am. He’s dropped subtle hints about getting together outside of work but nothing too obvious. 

I always catch him smiling and waving at me while at work and when he talks to me he’s always happy. He also tends to lean in while talking to me and will sometimes hover his hand over my back (nothing inappropriate at all). 

I’m interested in him as well so whenever I’m by him I always stutter, blush and get very nervous and he definitely notices. He’ll wink when he smiles at me and always calls me things like “good girl”, “young lady”, or “lil lady” but it’s never in a condescending tone.

t3_chqi02,Two perfect girls,"I'm a 16 y/o male and I'm in a pickle, about two years ago a friend asked me who my crush was I honestly didn't trust him to keep it to himself so I told him a different girl. About a month or two later he told me that someone asked him who my crush, that person was my actual crush who I'll refer to as L, L is very nice, pretty and very intelligent we've lived in the same neighborhood for as long as can remember, we go to the same church at the same time and I occasionally see her at church or other activities but I never really talk to her. My friend told her who he thought I had a crush on, so me being a dumb 8th grader thought I needed to act. I recruited a different friend to tell L that I liked her meanwhile I put a letter on her seat on the bus, I planned this to be on her birthday the letter basically went like this: I like you, try to find out who I am. I'll send you a letter every month. I thought this was a good idea although I never actually wrote another letter. The next day L was absent from school and one of her friends asked me if I liked L and wrote the letter I denied it. About a month later L's  brother asked if I wanted to know who L's crush was, scared that it wasn't me I said no. In hindsight that might have been a bad idea. Summer passed and I never really saw her. Then in 9th grade I saw a lot more of her but I didn't have a class with her until the second trimester. Our teacher as a get to know you question asked if I had a crush on anyone in the class I said no. Nothing really happened until the end of the year, I wrote in her yearbook: I'm sorry about the letter. I meant about how I gave it not the intent behind it. Sophomore year rolls around and I still like her but honestly I'm to scared to talk to her so what I thought was a good idea was to ask for another friends help, she really likes matchmaking people and we both been in as many of the school plays and musicals as possible I'll refer to her as A. One day A asked who everyones crushes were so she could help and I told her L. Later in the year I realise that I've developed a crush on A. And I start talking to her more I dropped a few hints that I liked her, I found her crush but she won't make a move on him because her friend also has a crush on him, I really enjoy her company, but recently when I walk past L in the hallway she smiles and waves or says "" hi"" and I realise that I really like both of them. In May senior ball was coming up and I asked what she would do if I asked her to the dance, she kind of brushes it off then asks me to take one of her other friends instead because her friend doesn't a date yet. I accepted but a few days later I told her I couldn't do it, I gave the excuse that I didn't know her friend very well and it would have been awkward she said she understood. At yearbook signing I wrote a compliment to her. It's now summer and I'm over thinking everything I've done, thinking if all the wrong ways it could be interpreted so I decided to go to the innternet, what should I do? do I even have a chance with either after all the dumb stuff I've done?

t3_chj628,Boyboyfriend shoved me during an argument last night,"So yesterday my boyfriend, his brother, and I all decided to go out for gyros. My boyfriend said he’d cover me, and I asked him if he was sure, I let him know I’d just have to go grab cash from my place. He reassured me and told me that it was okay and he would pay. So flash forward, we’re next in line and he points to something on the menu and asks if that’s what I’d like, I said yes, so he goes to order the food, he asks the lady for his gyro and a baklava, then she asks if that’s it and my boyfriend says yup pays for his meal puts his wallet away then turns to me and says what are you getting? Pretty embarrassing to feel like your boyfriend isn’t even willing to hold up his promise on buying a gyro. (If I sound like a needy bitch, keep in mind I pay for most of the dates that I have to beg him to go on with me) anyway so we go home and I make myself some ravioli, and we go to watch a movie. So I turned the over head lights off and left our spring lights on and go to turn on the tv. Well the HDMI cord is unplugged so I asked someone to hand me my phone so I could use the flash to plug it back in. To with a got a reply of “girls don’t know what they want” or “girls really can’t decide if they want a light on or off” any way so I turned to my boyfriend and jokingly said that if girls are so difficult that he should date a guy. He totally freak out and started shouting “IM NOT GAY, IM NOT A F**, IM NOT ATTRACTED TO GUYS, THATS A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY” etc. while he’s yelling at me I’m trying to tell him that it was a joke and nothing to be upset about, so he started telling me to shut up and be quiet and when I wasn’t he proceeded to shove me once while shouting to shut up, then he did it again harder while shouting. So this morning I broke up with him and left but he’s saying I overreacted about all of this and all his friends are agreeing and idk what to do now...

Update - thank you to everyone who reached out to me. It’s been a difficult night of trying to talk to him and he told me he wants me to wait for him, only so I can better myself, then this morning posts something saying how horribly I treated him and to hit him up now that he’s single. My heart kinda hurts because after driving him to and from work for a whole year and spending so much time and money planning out dates that he complained about and would drag his feet throughout.

t3_chqfu8,My boyfriend lied about not being a virgin and about all his girlfriends before me?,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months, and I'm 99% sure that he lied about not being a virgin and about all of his exes. He hasn't admitted the truth to me yet, but I just know he is lying. He told me he had sex with 3 girls before me (one, he said, was a girl from class, another was his ""ex-girlfriend,"" and another was a girl he had ""friends with benefits with""). He's lied about this kind of thing before... and I've gotten enough hints that he lied about this too. 

I haven't confronted him or anything yet. I understand why he did it. I think he felt intimidated because I have had many boyfriends before him including one very serious relationship that lasted 3 years. We were 18 years old when we met, so I understand how it can be embarrassing if he had never had a girlfriend before me and that he was a virgin. My only worries are the following:

1) He is easily able to lie to me. That worries me. Does he not see a future with me? I feel like boyfriends only lie to their girlfriends if they don't think their lies will ever be found out. I really care about him and want to be with him. But he is willing to lie so easily to me. Why?

2) If he was a virgin before me then could this explain his ""love"" for me? Does he not actually love me? What if he only cares so much about me because I am his first sexual partner and first girlfriend? What if his love for me isn't real? 

I just feel like this changes the whole dynamic of our relationship. I thought he loved me because he had girlfriends before me and realized we get along the best. What should I do? Should I confront him? Anyone's advice/opinions are greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_chqeuv,Me[32m] having issues with stepdaughter [22] female not contributing at all.,"I got together with my wife[42f] 13 years ago. She had 2 kids from earlier relationship. Both of them did not contribute to much household when they grew up, wich i did not have a problem with since they were kids. The youngest [18f] has been living for herself while studying  in a nearby city since she was 16. We contribute with some money, but she also get money from the state for living away from parents, just enough to pay rent and food. She has become pretty much independent allthough  she comes home to us allmost every weekend. But when she comes home, she contributes with doing dishes, washes her own clothes, has a part time job ect. 

The eldest daughter has also moved out 2 times. The last time together with her sister. Both times she moved home after 6 months. She struggles with depression, and has done for many years, so i get that she feels more safe at home. The problem is she never contributes with anything at home. Same story when she lived with her sister. But for some weird reason thinks she does a lot if she emptied the dishwasher 2 weeks ago and washes her own clothes every 14. day. She is getting help dealing with her depression seeing her shrink and hanging out with friends. She had a job, but it was to stressfull for her condition, wich I am conpletely fine with. She does receive some money from beeing unemployed, but she does not contribute with any money, not when she had a job and not now. When i bring it up with her, she does not want to talk about it, is too tired or answers with an attitude. Also when i bring It up, it stresses the hell out of my wife , cause of the atmosphere it creates in the house. She does help out with watching our youngest[3] from time to time, but it is often a struggle when asking her to help. Mostly because her little brother is very active. 

So what should i do to get her to just contribute with daily stuff in and outside the house. And not make it a struggle each time when asking her for any help.

t3_chqekd,GF cheated on me. Should I forgive her?,"Hello all, made this account for the sake of this post.

Yesterday, I (25M) was hanging out on my girlfriend's (21F, let's call her Laura) new room (she changed college so she moved closer to her future classes and also farther away from me. For context, this is a shared flat with 2 other girls and she moved in 3 weeks ago. ) when she asked me to tiddy the trash bin and get it ready to throw the trash away. As I picked the bag I saw a used condom case in there and I stopped and asked about because surely it wasn't mine. She confirmed it was from a guy (let's call him Jake) she is taking dance classes with and I started crying, a lot.

At the moment and before I knew about this we were going through a rough patch, starting in march she started to distance herself very slowly and it got to a point where she wasn't putting any effort on our online/text communication. By the end of May/start of June I was starting most of our interactions and decided we should talk, This talk happened mid June and she told me she wasn't sure she loved me anymore. It hurt me but we agreed on trying to make things better (I gave her more space and tried not to pressure her too much). Our sex life also declined starting around April but that wasn't/isn't even my concern compared to the whole relationship.

Around March aswell she started getting private dance lessons with a very good teacher and Jake. Jake was paying for the lessons as he was the one interested in the first place and because he needed a follower he invited Laura. They were taking 1 class each week since march and rarely 2 classes a week. She has also gone out with him a couple of times to dancing bars. Before all this started I actually supported her on this because she loves dancing, she would get to improve her skills and for free.

Coming back to yesterday, Laura said she wants to be with me and that she is really sorry and feels lost, does not love me as she once did and she started to like Jake. She said they had sex around 7-8 times since mid June and this is what broke me the most, imagining Laura on her new bed (which I carried 3 floors up), doing all kinds of stuff with Jake behind my back not once, not twice, but 7-8 times. While this was taking place my birthday went by, her birthday went by, family events went by and she was there with me like our only problem was she losing her feelings for me. I feel disgusted, betrayed, sad, angry and everything in between. How could she let it get to this point? We had a really good relationship up until march (almost 2 year long). We visited countless places, she slept on my house (live with parents) countless times (and me at her parents'), everybody on her and my family knows me and her personally. I gave 110% to her and I really believe i was a really good boyfriend always up for anything and ready to help her whenever, wherever.

I then told her if I am to accept and to heal from this, she needed to talk to Jake and tell him to stop everything. I was NEVER possessive of her nor I told her who she should hang out with and I felt wrong doing this but i viewed it as necessary, judge me as you please.

While i was writing this she just called me and asked for space and time to choose if she wants to continue our relationship or not and that she believes she should have dealt differently, also that she spoke to Jake and, to my shock, she implied there might even be a chance of she ending up with him. Not that this is a reason not to have a relationship but he is almost 20 years older than her, he hops country each few years and from what she told me 2 or 3 months ago he has plans to change countries soon. She is going to keep studying here and it feels so incompatible.

From my perspective, I think as she was losing interest in me, she tried to distance a bit and ended up developing a relationship with this other guy before even talking about the problem. It makes no sense though, giving attention to someone else in hopes of someday fixing our problem... but it is done.

Also a note, before I ever had a relationship and even during ours I told her that cheating is instant breakup but reddit, I pussied out. I couldn't do it on the spot even though I feel absolutely devastated and broken.

So here it is, I'm inclined to break up, Laura messed up before attempting to solve anything with me first and I think I'm just hoping for someone out there that could show me a silverlinning or even a different perspective that would help me decide to try and save the relationship our if this is a total loss. How should I proceed?

t3_chqchc,I drunkenly cheated on the girl I love more than anything (M22) (F21),"Hello everyone, thank you in advance for taking the time to help me out.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I are in a somewhat long term relationship; more than 3 years now. I have a history of cheating (a couple times with other people a long time ago), but never once did I consider doing so with this girl. I truly and honestly love her and want to stay with her forever.

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, lately we have been having trouble with affection even kissing sometimes. Her new depression medication makes it a struggle for her to be ""in the mood"" very often. We have talked about it already and I told her there is no reason for me to make her feel pressured to do something she doesn't feel like doing. It was an honest answer and I really don't have a problem with getting less affection from her as long as she still loves me. It was sort of hurting me since I felt unwanted, but less-so after we talked; and through all of this I was still more concerned about her mental well-being as that was a priority over my own insecurities.

&amp;#x200B;

While it is not by any means an excuse, I honestly feel it is worth saying that I think this may have played into my lapse of judgment; simply for the sake of sharing my objective thoughts. That feeling of being unwanted doesn't go away. It's something I ignore, and usually do a good job of because I have no doubts that we love each-other wholeheartedly.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, I had to cancel plans with my girlfriend to spend time with my friends who I forgot I made prior plans with. (We had discussed that mix-up as well and I will start using a calendar to keep track of my plans so she doesn't feel ignored.) She was invited to be with all of us, but was not feeling up to it, and may have been a little depressed at the time. The plan was for me to play a few drinking games with my friends, then go visit my girlfriend. I had gotten too drunk to drive at one point, then told her and she said it was fine and to just come over in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I had stopped worrying about how much I drank and decided to just relax and have fun. But clearly became too drunk. I started making out with one of our friends on and off over the course of about 20 minutes, and went down on her for about 5 seconds, stopped, and left to go lie down somewhere else. (I have no feelings for her at all). I immediately felt disgusted and just pretended to sleep until everyone left.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to entirely blame the alcohol. I know that no matter how impaired my judgment is, it's still my fault. However I know 100% I never would have done this sober, or even less drunk. I feel awful, disgusted with myself and can't think straight or get my work done. No matter what I am going to tell her this weekend, but I want to do it right.

Thank you in advance for anything you can recommend. I've given as much detail as I can think of and will add more if I think of anything.

t3_chqa31,"I suggested my so look at the roster for an upcoming tattoo convention, and now he’s convinced that I am shaming him for not having tattoos.","He has expressed an interest in them before (veeeery fleeting, just a mention of “that would be a cool tattoo” every few weeks), and mostly has stated he’s scared to get one because even a good artist can fuck up. I am pretty tattooed, and actively talk about how much I love that kind of art. But I don’t NEED my partner to be tattooed, is more something I like for myself.

Today I noticed there was a tattoo convention coming to my area, and I was kind of excited since tattoo artists from all around the world are coming. Off handedly, I mentioned that my SO should look at their roster and see if there’s an artist he likes (since these artists will only be here for a limited time and many of them are from other countries).

He immediately blew up. He started telling me he was wondering when I’d start pressuring him to get one, and that if I wanted a tattooed man I should just go fuck someone else.

Mind you, I really don’t consider tattoos when I date someone. I just really like them on myself. I tried explaining to him that I was just suggesting he look at the artists since he had expressed his insecurity in finding the right one before. That I didn’t NEED him to get tattooed at all, let alone at this convention.

He started crying and telling me to fuck off. He exclaimed: “How would you like it if I went ‘hey so they are selling discount gym memberships, how about we go so you can lose weight’?!?!” 
That really kind of hurt, and I’ve been trying to see it from his perspective since then. I really don’t feel that strongly about wether or not he’s modified. I just...idk. It seems I really damaged his self esteem and how attractive he feels, but he won’t believe me when I tell him that I wasn’t trying to pressure him to get a tattoo.

After that, we would meet a couple more times. He later mentioned that he had a female roommate and casually mentioned that they used to date and would get back together soon. He explained that they were on a break for the summer and previously had an open relationship together. The next time I saw him, he had moved into a new apartment with this girlfriend and they were continuing their open relationship. I had never slept with someone in an open relationship, so I didn't think too much of it.

We would continue to see each other. One time felt particularly intimate that when I went away for university, he texted me, saying that he really missed me and that the sex felt very intense and romantic. We would continue to talk long-distance and he called me, out of the blue, for solace after he and his girlfriend broke up. (They got back together a week later) I naïvely continued talking to him, because I liked him and I liked the sex.

We saw each other a couple more times until some time later, he would tell me that he couldn't see me in the near future since his girlfriend didn't want an open relationship at that time. I felt terrible and honestly hurt. I cried it out and in the months that passed, life went on. He texted me months after we had talked, asking me if I was in town: I wasn't. He texted me again a couple months later, trying to say hello and make conversation, not really mentioning the last conversation we had. I just made polite conversation before I said bye.

He texted me again when I was back home and asked if I was back. I told him I wasn't interested in speaking to him anymore. I feel that this was more intimate than a casual hookup, but not moving towards anything else so it was best to end it.

Is it best to end these kinds of relationships?

tl;dr: I ended what started off as a casual sex thing because it was benefitting the guy more than for me.",relationship_advice
t3_chq7u8,Dating women from different cultures. Is there anything I should be considering?,"I'm a 29 year old white male from the northeast. I've only ever dated American women but I've recently started talking to an Indian woman (26f). Things seem to be going great so far. We're attracted to eachother and we get along great. She's lived in the US for roughly 7 years. Is there anything I need to consider when it comes to our cultural differences? Or should I just carry on as normal? 

Just to be clear - I'm not asking if i should be acting differently. I will always be myself and stay true to myself. I'm just wondering if there's anything i need to be considering. Have any of you dated someone from a vastly different culture? How did it go? Were there any challenges? What, if anything, should i be mindful of?",relationship_advice
t3_chq7ps,My (16M) Ex (15F) is trying to come back into my life.,"We dated pretty seriously for 2 years. Of course we are younger so we hung out alot at school and we had sports and other things todo. Hung out about 2 or 3 times a week (not in school)

But here's the story:

First day of summer she breaks up with me over text. There is a lot to it, but she did me wrong. She went to parties all week and did other things. I also believe she met another guy and started talking to him too (I don't think they even kissed). She told me she just lost love for me, but I feel that she didn't want to be restricted to me.

I took it pretty hard. I cried, my stomach was in a knot, and I wanted to text her so bad. I texted her and I was just like ""What even happened"" ""Why can't we talk about this in person"" and other questions because I was so upset. 

That was about a month and a half ago and I've stayed away from her since. I still think of her, and still going through the break up process. But I've kind of forgotten about her. 

So one night ago she texts me at 3 AM and then deletes the DM (I could see the notification, but not the whole message). I wake up and check my phone and I'm like stunned. I was honestly shaking a little bit. I thought this was over.

I text her ""what"" and go on with my day. She wakes up a few hours after me and she tells me she felt lonely and she was crying, but she's okay now. I ended up giving her advice and she opened up to me a little bit. 

So right now, this is how I'm guessing she feels:

She doesn't know if she wants me back, but she misses me being around because I cared about her. I treated her so well and really gave my all for her.

I feel:

So confused. I've been going through the break up process and she did me wrong. But I miss her too and I kind of want her back.

I know right now I could block her and not have to think of this anymore, but at the same time I feel that we could really build up our relationship again. I feel like if we got back together, it would take weeks of rebuilding and lots of change would have to happen. I love how I have space now, and I'm not worried about anyone. But I feel like I could have some space and her too. 

I guess I should add this in too; I have done alot for myself since the break up. I've lost 10 pounds and I've been working out a ton. I've also been hanging out with my guy friends alot and building those relationships more too.

t3_chq7ke,Am I going to regret not wanting to be around my family?,"I come from a dysfunctional family. No one in my family likes each other and the way they communicate is through arguing and bitching. We had the last ""family vacation"" ever a few months ago. I knew in my gut that I shouldn't have went and it ended disastrously and violently. I want nothing to do with my parents and brother. They are violent, angry people and don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. I get depressed being around them. I have told them in the past that I was suicidal only to have it thrown in my face during every argument like ""maybe if you did something with your life you wouldn't want to kill yourself"" and ""get up off your lazy ass, no wonder you are depressed and try to make everyone else miserable"" and similar things like that.

I guess my question is for anyone who came from a dysfunctional and abusive family and decided to distance themselves. Would I regret it? We're supposed to be close to our families and ""cherish"" the short time we have with them but I honestly just resent them and they lead me to suicidal thoughts because they remind me that I am alone in this world and nobody truly cares about me. They have their ""good"" moments but those are outweighed by the bad. I don't like talking to them at all because it leads to a fight 99% of the time.

t3_chocth,Can a relationship or marriage last without “the look”?,"You know what I’m talking about, that gaze where you guys just kinda melt and it feels like you’re in a bubble together, and without saying anything you can just feel how much the other person loves you.

t3_chq3uf,Girlfriend posted pictures with her ex on Instagram,"My [19M] gf [19F] and I have been dating for 8 months. Things are awesome, however this last weekend my girlfriend let me know that she would be seeing her ex.
 
This is the text messages:

Her: ""btw I'm going to meet with (ex) on Friday. He's ... I think he's on crack""

Me: Okay thanks for telling me I hope he's okay

Her: Same, I thought I'd let you know. He's drugged out that's all I can say. I'll find out when I see him. He looks ill and I hate him for it. I really think he needs a genuine talk.
 
After that we played an online game together and went to bed.
 
I don't really know what they did Friday; it's not really any of my business, but she did mention that she rewatched a movie in theater that we had seen. Anyways, the next day she uploaded photos to her Instagram of her and him from the night before. They weren't touching or anything, the photos were them individually not together. Even so, I felt a little uncomfortable. Yesterday, on her Instagram for her music, she released an old photo of her and her ex. I'm guessing it's prom photos from their senior year of high school. She looks nice in it and I imagine that's what she would say if I asked why she uploaded it. This picture made me very uncomfortable as he had his hand wrapped around her waist.
 
Their breakup was very one sided. He would often text her saying that he loved her while we were dating/fwb. What's a bit puzzling is that she said he came out as gay to her and I believe it (reasosn I believe it that I won't bother explaining). I've met him a couple of times, once at a party. The entire time we were at the party she clung to me but he would drag her away and was very jealous towards me (still while we were dating/fwb). Once we began our relationship I told her he needed to stop so she sent him a text that she's not single and he needed to back off. I don't know if they hangout or how often. I don't know how much they communicate or how often. I don't even care, honestly. What I do know is that seeing the picture of her and him together made me very uncomfortable. Communication is key and I'll certainly bring it up the next time I see her. I would just like to hear my fellow redditors thoughts or advice.",relationship_advice

Hello there, I'm in need of some advices...

I've noticed that my girlfriend is starting to get a litle nervous everytime I ask her, hers phone just to take a picture of her.

There's a guy thats calls her every month when we are out of town, and 3 days ago, she woke up at 6:45 and texted her mother just saying: ""Don't worry, I'm okay"", her mother called me 2 hours later asking if I knew where she was, I told her I didn't. Later she called her mother and then me to say that she was okay and went to a girl friend in need.

At this point, I was nervous and started to getting  suspicious about this. She told me everything was okay and promised me that she wasn't where another dude.

This morning, the asked me to look at her phone for setting an alarm, and the phone was locked on some messages from that guy who sometimes calls her and I saw the text from him ""So, did you enjoyed?"" and her awnser ""Yes, I did and you?"".

I don't know what to do, it feels so bad in my mind, I wish I haven't seen that, I don't want to just talk to her and say ""I saw your text's"". I don't know what to do....

t3_chq1ml,"my cousin called me “stupid” and a “fuck up” on a holiday that my side of the family paid for, what do I do?","Sorry for grammatical errors, not my first language. 

So my cousin, Mathéo,(22m) and I (20m) were heading home to Toronto from the Sydney Airport. We get a taxi about two or so hours before our flight leaves, traffic was beyond terrible. We end up missing our flight, so I say, “I’ll try to find a new one. This is okay, we will find a new one soon.”

Mat starts to get super pushy and starts to complain how this is entirely my fault. I had paid for his ticket and mine, so I guess in his mind it was all on me. I can’t control traffic or the airline company. I decide that if I get pushy with him back, he’ll explode at me. So I sit there, on my phone trying to find tickets back home. As I’m spending an extra 3,500 CAD to get us our flight home, he loses it and tells me that I’m a “fuck up” and that I’m stupid. I’m taking all of his insults to not start a fight with him. 

I decide to make a quick email to our family and friends, letting them know that we are going to be home later than expected and not to worry. Mat sees this email due to his mother asking about it. He tells me that I’m acting rude, careless, and not being considerate with how he is feeling. He has a fiancée at home and a kid, so he wants to see them as soon as possible. I have a family too, whom I miss. I was being calm so I could think. He then insinuated that the reason I wasn’t visibly upset was that I don’t care for my family. He knows my family well and knows fully well that two of my family members have rare neuron destroying illnesses that have shortened their lifespans, but he told me that I don’t understand what it feels like to worry for anyone except myself. This was when I decided to defend myself, because he decided to take a jab at my side of the family.

I tell him that there was traffic and that it wasn’t my intention to miss the flight, flights are missed all the time. I tell him that his anger is misdirected at me and that I will have him on a flight soon. I tell him that I’m going elsewhere for now and that he needs to calm. I remind him that the family he decided to badmouth, spent over 3,000 CAD (plus the tickets) for him to have a free holiday.

We get on our new flight, barely an hour and a half hours later. I apologize for forgetting to remind him to check his boarding pass the day before and I apologize for being calm, I explained that I needed to be calm in order to get a new flight and that missed flights occur all the time. He says, “Yeah.” And then looked at the ground without saying anything. 

On the flight, he played it off and acted like we were completely fine. He told me jokes and I laughed and we had some good conversation. It felt normal, but in the back of my mind all I could think about was how rude he was to me. I usually say that things like this are just water off a duck’s back but I honestly still feel very hurt.

It’s been about five days and he hasn’t said any single “thank you” or “I’m sorry” to me after everything. We had a good two and a half weeks to explore Australia, it was really incredible. But I feel wounded by his words that he told me at the airport. Is there any way I can solve this or get him to at least apologize? I just want to know if he resents me or if our relationship is ruined. 

To me, it felt like he was using the simple issue of missing the plane ride as an excuse to dig into me and let me know how he’s really been feeling about me.",relationship_advice
t3_cho9hl,I spilled water on my friend's hidden laptop. How much should I compensate her?,"I was at a friend's house and I accidentally knocked a [stand like this](https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_d45241a7-7e82-4e3f-80db-5895fec03d54?wid=488&amp;hei=488&amp;fmt=webp) with a cup of water on it in the living room. It turned out that another friend was charging her laptop hidden under the couch next to the stand, and water got onto her laptop, damaging it. The estimated repair cost of the laptop far exceeds what the laptop was worth right before the spill.

What's appropriate to pay my friend? Obviously I'm at fault for spilling the drink, but I also feel like my friend definitely shares part of the blame because she both placed her laptop in an area where drinks are likely to be spilled and also hid it under the couch.

t3_chpzm7,"I (m/29) have been with my wife (f/28) for 5 1/2 years. Through years of lies/deceit/gaslighting, we’re filing for divorce today.","Brace yourselves it’s gonna be a long one. At the end of it, I’d like to know other’s thoughts on where we as a couple fucked up, especially me, so that for any possible future relationships I’m in I’ll be a better partner. 

Ever since the beginning of our relationship, my wife has kept in touch with several men whom she says are just old friends and people she likes to stay in touch with. When we were first dating, it wasn’t a big deal, she has her friends I have mine. It wasn’t until after I saw that several of those guys made their intentions known that they showed interest in her and wanted more, that I started getting upset at the idea. Every time I would bring it up, because it happened all the time, she would say that I’m being crazy and blowing things out of proportion. That they were just friends. Some of these guys asked for help on “knowing where to get a blowjob” or when she asked her ex “do you think I’m still attractive?” (Right after having our first child kind you) his response was “10/10 would want”. There are literally too many occasions to count where she has had similar interactions with other guys, with the same response of the initially hyper defensiveness then explosiveness toward me saying I’m being controlling and I’m crazy to think any of this is inappropriate because “it’s not like I’m sleeping with any of them. Keep in mind, several of the strictly platonic girl friends I had at the beginning of our relationship whom I would never text or dm or anything like that, I had to cut off contact/delete numbers/unfriend because she somehow felt threatened by them when they would like pictures/posts of mine and because a few were pretty. I kid you not, we were at a mutual friend’s 4th of July party and one of the girls she had a particular jealousy of, I INTENTIONALLY avoided the entire night, said hello to me as we were leaving. Her response was to fight with me as soon as we got in the car, and cry the entire way home because we “were making eyes at each other”. That being said, fast forward to about 3 years into our relationship, roughly 1.5 years married (I know, I’m dumb) we have our daughter and think of plans for a second. This is after that text I saw from her ex, and we agreed that she would cut him off and unfriend/delete his number because if there was gonna be an “us” there couldn’t be a him. Things are going well, we’ve since bought a house, have a perfect child. Life is good. Then one day I see she’s friends with him again on facebook and IG and they’re liking each other’s posts. She’s the type that likes to post gym selfies, because hey, she has a great body why not. I tell her I noticed they’re interacting again and I’m like “bruh wtf”. She tells me that I need to calm down that there’s nothing between them. Now I forgot to mention that this guy is military and he’s stationed in England, but he’s from the same city so maybe like once every year or two he’ll be in town. So I felt( whether rightfully or not) hurt again, and made an issue of it. I was pissed. I broke a picture frame of ours and slammed a couple doors. It’s at this time that my wife says she’s scared of me and that I’m being abusive because of my temper. Now, to this day I have NEVER laid a hand on my wife or my kids but I have had the occasional flare up when this kind of thing happens. At this point we both agree to start marriage counseling, and soon after I agree willingly to start anger management. We have a baby together and I’m not letting her grow up in a household of an angry parent. My parents did it, I’m not going to. Things are ok between us. It’s amazing what time can do and what it feelings it can subdue. We now have a second child. At this point we’ve come to a compromise about her talking to her ex/other men. She has a lot of issues in her past that make this particular case challenging. It’s confirmed with our therapist so after understanding, the compromise is that she can have her friendship (albeit an inappropriate one) as long as I don’t see it. Out of sight out of mind. I didn’t want to be the controlling spouse so we figured this was the best way. Bruh, I was wrong. 

Fast forward to about a year ago. She works with CPS and has for several years. Well at work there is this guy in another department who she tells me is funny and that they’re friends. At first it’s like, cool story bro. Well after hearing about this guy every once in a while it starts bothering me. Her behavior is slowly changing, she’s more secretive with her phone, our intimacy drops dramatically, she starts getting a new wardrobe to the tune of several hundred dollars. Yeah that’s USD folks (keep in mind she is the most frugal person I know and the entire time we’ve been together she’s maybe spent $100 on new clothes.) and has since decided she wants to transfer departments. To which one? Oh you know. Buddy buddy’s department. I address all of these things. The phone? It was agreed we wouldn’t snoop through each other’s things, so she keeps it passcode locked. Intimacy? We have 2 very young children and we’re both full time workers. Completely understandable. Wardrobe? It’s so she can feel better about herself because again, it makes her feel nice. I get it she deserves to, she’s a mom. All moms deserve that. I still show some hesitancy toward that one though because honestly, if you guys knew her it’s probably the most out of character for her. Even her mom brought that one up. The job transfer? Admittedly, she did tell me from the beginning of her career that she’s always wanted that job but a spot just finally came up. I tell her I understand all of those things more or less individually, but ask if she just look at the whole picture from my perspective and that it looks pretty suspect. She agrees it does, but tells me that I have nothing to worry about. It’s at this point I feel it’s on me to be a more supportive husband and help make sure the load on her is less. I start doing more around the house (I’m already the one that makes dinner and cleans the kitchen) but being more active making sure the kids are taken care of. Do more of the doctors visits. Take more time off from when the kids are sick and have to be out of daycare. Do more about making sure bills get paid. Putting my feelings aside so she feels supported. 

She gets the transfer and her “friendship” with coworker amplifies. They start sharing intimate details about personal lives, etc. I find out from her that he’s known around the office for trying to get with married women and that he himself has a rocky marriage. I wonder why. I tell her that she’s playing with fire and that they need to cool it. She blows up. Calls me controlling. I’m crazy for thinking they’re more than friends. I’m too jealous over nothing. “Any sane person would see this is innocent”. 

Cool.

We separate around November of last year. Not a legal separation mind you. Just for funsies I suppose. I was under the assumption we would re-assess our marriage and come back as stronger partners. APPARENTLY she took it to mean it was free game to cheat on me with coworker. And cheat on me she did. Won’t get into specifics, but know that I had to pull whatever truth I could out of her like it was the hardest thing I ever had to do. To this day I don’t think I got the whole truth and I never will. Oh well. 

Through counseling, I decide, for me if I wanted our marriage to work I had to put away my pain and forgive her. My marriage, my family, the years...it’s all more important than my hurt. So I forgive. I promise to look past it and hope from there on out we can move forward. Under the condition that she now has to be 100% honest with me and show me that if she wants it to work she has to prove it to me. And that regardless of the things either one of us had done prior to February, my temper, her cheating, it didn’t matter. This is our new start, and we can’t use the last 5ish years against the other. 

That was February. We got back together, and for the most part things were better. She told me she cut coworker off. Come to find out she didn’t and has since several times stayed in contact with him. (I wouldn’t know until later) Keep in mind. Throughout all of this, I hadn’t shown my temper or had an explosive moment in a long time. 

3 days ago. 
Things had been a little shaky but the month of June was rock solid. We’re clicking like we haven’t in a long time. We haven’t even argued about anything in over a month. I haven’t been upset/mad about anything. This is it, this is what I was hoping for and things are finally looking bright again. 

I see our phone bill and that there were more texts on her side than usual. I see because, come the fuck on of course I looked. It’s co worker again. Texting her on July 4 when were were down visiting my in-laws. I say nothing and just decide to go to bed early. Talk about it tomorrow. She notices I seemed a bit off. She asks what’s wrong. “...Nothing”.  Louder this time “what’s wrong?” I don’t want to talk about it. She doesn’t relent. I finally crack, “care to explain why I just saw that you and coworker texted again, and you didn’t think to let me know?  It would have been the perfect opportunity to show me that you’re trying to be open and honest and go toward rebuilding the trust that was lost. The trust you get mad at me for not having in you”. “It was nothing. Nothing happened I ignored him after the first text. Here you go all over again overreacting.” It turns into the same argument as always. We sleep in different rooms that night. 
The next day I reflect and tell her I’m sorry I got heated and misplaced my anger. I was mad at him for still trying to but into our lives. I wanted to tell her that she needs to tell him to fuck off and leave her alone because she’s working on it with her husband. She stops me short and tells me, the problem isn’t him, it’s my attitude. 

I’m floored. No more. I’m done. 

Today we go to speak to our divorce attorney.

So i matched this guy on Tinder back in January and find out that he lives across the country and was just in town for work. We talk for months until he was in town again. I didn’t want to stay with him the whole time because we both said we wanted something casual. Come to find out the last day that he had only travelled to come see me. 

Fast forward to four months later, we are supposed to meet in Nashville in a few weeks. Although I know we can’t be in a relationship because of distance, I definitely like this guy and I assumed he actually liked me too because of the things he says to me and not to mention the fact that he is flying for a second time to visit me. 

Well the past two weeks he has been almost dead silent, short, no heys. But he does reach out about our trip? I feel like he isn’t interested anymore which is fine and I understand that but I have presented him with opportunities to cancel the trip, end things, etc. 

Can someone help me tap into this guys brain a little bit? Should I end things because he’s too scared to? Should I confront him being distant even though it’s not a relationship? Should I cancel the trip? I like him but I’m not interested in being strung along.

My birthday was last week and we had everyone come over to hang out. A few hours in, my best friends’ (Joe) wife (Jane) comes in all dressed up, tells me happy birthday and then just disappears. The whole thing was a bit odd for those that noticed she was there. 

She FaceTimed me on her way back home and told me that she has loved me for the last 10 years that we’ve known each other and she couldn’t keep it in anymore. I’m in complete shock. She’s married and I’m married. 

She hangs up and I go straight to my wife (we’ll call her Liz) and tell her what just happened. Apparently Liz and the rest of my family have seen this coming for the past couple years and I was just oblivious to Jane’s behavior towards me. 

Yes, I told my family about it. If Jane ends up trying to mix me into some story, my family has my back. But my family all told me not to tell Joe and I know they all won’t say anything. It’s tearing me apart. Joe is my best friend and I’ve known him for as long as I’ve also known Jane. 

Jane and Joe have a kid and a business together. They’re obviously not happy but I don’t want to be the reason that they divorce. I also would hate to lose Joe because of this. It’ll mess up everything. Am I wrong for not telling Joe? Should I tell him? If so, how do I do it so that it doesn’t become my fault? I’m happily married to Liz, I want nothing to do with Jane. I don’t know what to do

TLDR: best friends wife is in love with me, a married man. Told my wife and family. Everyone is telling me not to tell my best friend.",relationship_advice
t3_cho1t1,How to get over someone,I liked my friend. We had a fwb relationship for a few months. Things have died and I’m on this rollercoaster where I like her and I don’t. I want to stay as friends but completely get over her. I know it’s stupid and silly. 😩,relationship_advice
t3_chpqy9,My fiance (f27) is leaving me (m27) and wants to do split custody of our 1 year old boy,"I am an absolute wreck right now and I don't know if sharing my story will help but here goes.

Biggest piece of context that should obviously come first is that we have a 1 year old son.

We started dating about 7 years ago and it was amazing at first. She's my best friend's cousin and I was working for their aunt's small business thanks to my best friend getting me the job. She was home from school for the summer and working there to save up some money (I say ""home"" because this is where we are both from. Her family was originally from the area she was going to school and recently moved back). We knew each other through the job before but didn't work together much but when we did, there was always a flirtatious chemistry. So when I found out she was going to be here all summer, I got excited and couldn't wait to get to know her better. The summer was unreal. We fell in love. Madly in love. After just a few months of dating we decided do stay together even though where she was going to school was about a 14 hour drive away. 

We did long distance for a year. It was incredibly hard but she decided to move back home and got a place right near me. We were now going to the same community college and I spent most of my time at her apartment. I wasn't in a great place at this time though. I was working a lot so school was hard and I had a few hiccups that delayed my transfer process. I wasn't happy with myself and felt as if I was running in place. When I finally got into university, I decided to break things off. It was a new chapter of my life and I wanted to do college as a single person. She moved back to go to school 14 hours away. I know I hurt but I think we both knew we still loved each other. The first 6 months we only talked occasionally but the contact started to pick up to the point where we talked every day. We were committed again and in a long distance relationship. This went on for a year and a half. Once again it was incredibly hard, but we got through it. When she graduated college, I still had a year left but we decided to move in together. We got a town home in my college town and it was great. Together forever at last. 

One big problem though. I like to smoke weed. She has never been a fan but became more accepting that I do it over time. She agreed it was okay that I did it in our home but it probably got out of hand. I did it every day. Mostly just at night. But when I'm smoking, I tend to stay up late and get pretty lazy. She's a neat freak and can't stand for the house to be a mess. My laziness made most of the house cleaning fall on her. 

The next big problem. We got a puppy. She wanted one so bad. I was hesitant but I love her so much I couldn't tell her no. And we were committed to each other, so committing to a dog together wasn't scary at first. With a dog comes a lot more work than either of us expected. And then me over here, senioritis, just want to stay up all night playing video games, most of that work fell on her. She went to work and came home for lunch and still had to take the dog out and whatever else because most of my classes were in the afternoon so I slept in, often till about 1PM. 

Graduation is coming up. Our lease is going to end. I didn't have a job lined up and hadn't changed my behaviors much. She decided to leave me and move back with her parents 14 hours away. This hurt like hell but I could sense that she wasn't completely sure. She stayed for my graduation and cheered harder than anybody when I walked across the stage. That day was bitter sweet though as the next day she was leaving. 

Within days, she realized she made a mistake. She wasn't happy being away from me. So we were back to talking everyday, saying ""I love you"", everything. I just had to get my shit together. I put my head down, quit smoking, and started searching for a job. 

She took the dog with her. We love him, but he's a handful. It was hard for her to do it alone. She had said when she decided to leave, that we shouldn't have gotten him because of the stress it put on us. I agreed but he's ours now and it is what it is. She called me one night in tears because she wanted to re-home him. I was adamant about her not doing this. I love my dog and couldn't live with myself after giving him up. She agreed to keep him. 

I finally found a contract job a few hours from home but still obviously very far from her. We decided to move in with each other again. I flew to her and her parents and I helped pack her up and move her across the country once again. We were happy again. In love. Together. 

This was a big city though. So it was hard for us to beat the traffic and come home to let the dog out during the day so we got a dog walker. Yet another expense on on top of many others that were hard to manage with our entry-level jobs. We made it work for the most part but we had some fights and things weren't perfect. Then it happened. She got pregnant. We were terrified. Not even close to ready. We stayed in the city for a while until my contact ended and moved back home with my mom and step dad. I aggressively searched for jobs until I finally found one. It was about an hour commute from my parents house. She really wanted to stay close to my family with the baby on the way since we were going to need some help. I agreed but was a bit reluctant due to the commute. So we found a house nearby my family and it was perfect for us. Her parents bought the house through the business they owned and rent it to us. The plan has anyways been for me to eventually buy it. Through all the feelings we were having about the changes in our lives, we leaned on each other. And I was strong for her. She had a tough pregnancy and I was always there to help her with whatever she needed. I manned up and was who she needed me to be finally. She had the baby and it was hard but we were making it work. And I was doing my part the best I could. Our son had some health scares early on and we leaned on each other through that. All of this brought us even closer. 

But over time, we settled into routines. She was staying home with baby and I worked. But I needed to come home and help her with things around the house and I fell short there. Some days I didn't but most, I did. I decided in my mind that it made no sense for me to wake up with him in the morning because I was the one working. This attitude trickled into many other responsibilities. 

We both put on a good bit of weight. It's hard to find time to workout and easy to eat out when there's not much time to cook. At least this is what I convinced myself.

Work got very stressful for me. Add the commute to it and I was miserable. I started staying up late because I was anxious about work and didn't want to go. So I tried to enjoy more me time than I probably should. Then I started smoking again and it made all of that worse. I would go to work exhausted and have no energy when I got home. And I was hiding the smoking from her. I would wait till she went to sleep. She caught me and we had a big fight. She didn't want me doing it. I thought ""I'm a grown man, I should be able to do this as long as I'm still the father I need to be"" and I truly believed that. So I tried to convince her to let me keep doing it. Because it relaxed me and helped with my anxiety. But I was ignorant to the fact that it made me stay up even later and that has a domino effect on many other things. I told her I'd quit. I didn't. She caught me again. Told her I'd stop. I didn't. Finally she caught me again and told me to leave. I begged her to let me stay and she agreed but she was hurt. Instead of realizing just how hurt she was, I decided to continue to convince her that it wasn't that big of a deal. Not necessarily so I could keep doing it, but so that I wasn't viewed as this terrible person in her eyes. But it doesn't matter how bad she views the smoking itself, I lied to her repeatedly. I felt bad about it then but now my eyes are wide open and I hate myself for it. 

I know I have anxiety and may suffer from depression. I don't like to say it because it feels like excuses. But the truth is, I let the stresses of these major life shifts get the better of me. And let the ones I love around me suffer through it with me. 

A few more months passed and his first birthday passed and I thought things were okay. But she shut me out a lot and really turned down the affection. Whether it be just spending time or being physical. Our sex life was almost non-existent at this point and when we did have sex, it seemed to be more to appease me than anything. Last week I got in bed with her and put my arm around to cuddle her. She let out an annoyed exhale and made no effort to welcome me in to cuddling her. So I rolled over and she asked me what was wrong. I essentially asked her if she still wanted to be with me. To which she responded, no and that she doesn't feel the same way about me anymore. We talked a bit more and I promised her I'd change. I'd do more around the house and step up more for our son. She has gone pretty cold at this point and didn't have much to say other than she needed space. I took our son and the dog to my moms and left her to herself all weekend. We only talked about our son, this is what she wanted. I came back home on Sunday and we talked. I promised her I was going to be a new person. This time, I actually believe myself. But I can't tell if she does. I had already gone to the gym every day over the weekend and started a diet that I am determined to stick to. She told me she wants me to work on myself but to do it away from her. She said she missed our son over the weekend, but not necessarily me and the dog. I still convinced her to let me stay. She said I could stay for the week. I got up every morning this week with our boy, kept him entertained, changed him, fed him, while she got ready for work. Then she takes him to daycare because it's near her work and not mine. I then get ready for work and then come home and have made dinner twice this week when I've gotten home in time, did everything I could think to do to help her around the house, absolutely busting my ass. 

She says this has actually pissed her off more than anything because I am proving that I'm capable of doing these things but have refused to do then for most of the past year. I understand this. I'm pissed at myself too. I wish I could go back in time and not be such a shit bag. Another thing I did was continue to tell her ""I love you"" during the times I normally would. She wasn't saying it back. This triggered her wanting to talk to me last night. She said she needed me to stop saying it. She feels like it's hurting me every time she doesn't and it makes her feel awkward. I just feel awkward not saying it because it's how I feel. She then tells me she wants me to leave. I continue to fight to convince her to believe that I'm changed but it's ""too little too late"" and then anger sets in and I say some things I wish I could shove right back in my mouth. I'm so angry with her but at the same time I can't blame her. 

She wants to do split custody. I will never agree to anything less than 50% of the time with my son but it's killing me to think we will have a different roof over our heads for the other 50%. I also have nowhere to go but my moms where it's cramped and not where I want to be raising my son. My mom is willing to help me out and I'm appreciative, but I just want to be home where our family can be together and he has all of his things that he needs.

I love this girl and I want my family all in one piece. I can't believe I've been so ignorant for so long. I've told her and I mean it, I will do anything to fix this.

If anybody else has gone through something similar, how did you handle it?

t3_chppz2,I’m confident in our relationship but jealous about attention,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 4 years and he is absolutely wonderful. He teaches me new things every day and opens me up to so many perspectives and I love him dearly. I know that he won’t cheat on me, or at least I truly believe that he won’t. That’s not my concern. He has done an amazing job reassuring me and making me feel secure, which is why I don’t get why I act so irrational. 

Lately he’s been showing a prolonged interest in a girl that he took a summer course with and I went a little crazy. I get flustered and paranoid whenever I hear about her, I’m not sure what I’m paranoid of though. I understand that it is okay for him to be non romantically interested in other girls, the logic is completely sound with what he is doing but it still makes me feel horrible and I don’t know why. 

I used to be a little up tight and am trying really hard to let that go because I don’t want him to feel like this relationship is holding him back from anything, he should be able to do just about anything he wants. I just need help to get my emotional side under control and on the same page as my logical side.",relationship_advice

t3_chnxcs,I don't know what to do.,"Ok so, I've never once made a post on Reddit before, so I just made this random account. I've lurked around though. Anyways I am feeling hurt by something my bf did, and he doesn't know I found out about it. We are a gay couple, been together for over 2 years. We both have new cars, thanks to my credit being very good, and live in a decent home in Florida. He has changed jobs about 6 times since I've met him. And 4 times since we have been living together. I've managed to keep the same job for over 5 years. 

Well it turns out that someone I work with knew the project manager he worked for at his old job. In fact they are very good friends and the only reason they know about us is we had gone to my friends wedding and bumped into his old project manager. I have to bring this up so you can understand why I'm so hurt by what happens next. 

Yesterday morning I went into work and my friend pulls me aside and tells me she has something she thinks I need to know about. Well project manager for bf told my friend that bf was fired from his job for always being late and always being on his phone rather than working. He had told me he was laid off. Now this is the one that is really hitting me hard. Bf told people he worked with that I was depressed because we had adopted a child and shortly after the state was involved and took the kid away and I was contemplating suicide. I don't know how to react to hearing about this information, as this isn't the first time I've caught him in a lie, but never this bad of one. I want to sit him down and talk about it because I need to know why someone would just come up with a story like that. But at the same time I really just want to pack my car and leave without saying a word.",relationship_advice

I don’t want to tie him down or be a burden to his new life, but since we decided to try out long distance is there any tips or things I should be aware of ?? We are pretty chill and open, like we communicate well. We both decide to just go with the flow and see if it works out. 

We both are aware that with distance and time it will be harder to be together, and there will be new people we would wanna explore and meet. We are comfortable with that thought; like I don’t mind if he wants to break up and meet someone else, don’t wanna tie him down and guilt him he’s 19 lmao vise versa. 

There’s more issues than what I’ve stated above and those issues are also more nuanced. I just want to know more of what to expect and what’s gonna happen so I can prepare ?? Also maybe tips to make the relationship more fun and not that much of a burden.",relationship_advice

t3_chnwky,My husband (35) is making me (26)choose between my dog and him. What should I do?,"My husband and I have been together for 7 years. A year and a half ago we rescued a dog that we knew had been abused. When I went to the shelter to look for a dog, he wasn’t really a part of the process. I showed him several dogs and he had an uninterested attitude. I ended up getting a chiweenie because I love wiener dogs and he loves chihuahuas. I told him they were a difficult breed but he dismissed it.

They haven’t exactly bonded. My dog has picked me as his owner and he’d do anything to protect me.

Last night we were trying to give him medicine and he snapped. He is scared when people touch his eyes for some reason. So, he growled. My husband decided to smack him across the face with the remote. Then my dog bit him on the arm. 

I got bit in the process as well. Now my husband is being terrible to my dog and I don’t really think it was his fault. He shouldn’t have hit the dog in the face. 

He said I always pick the dog over him and that I needed to choose. He hasn’t changed his mind this morning. I love my dog. I can’t get rid of him but I also want to work this out with my husband.

**Also, this is not the first time something like this has happened. My husband thought it would be funny to get right into my dogs face and growl at him and make mean faces. My dog growled and tried to get him to go away but he continued, so the dog bit him.

Then another time he was annoying the cat and the cat scratched his lip and he was so pissed at him for weeks.

I don’t want to choose sides but I don’t think this is my dogs fault. Am I wrong here or is he making terrible decisions?!",relationship_advice
t3_chmuwa,"Can take the girl out the club, but cant make a stripper a housewife","I'm having some serious doubts about my relationship with my boyfriend, and it's so frustrating.

I used to be a stripper, and that's how he met me. We hung out a few times outaide of my work and then we finally did the deed after a few weeks of dating. We had a DTR talk and we became boyfriend and girlfriend, so I know I wasnt confused in the early days. We used to see each other 1-3 times a week. I took Saturdays off because Sundays were his only day off, and he would come over for dinner once or twice during the week. 

We were both recently divorced, and we were both on the same page of that not happening again. He told me he wasn't opposed to getting a place together eventually in the future, but he wasnt really into the thought of marriage. I was almost the same. I was open to getting a place together, but would consider marriage again only without it being my final destination. I'd be happy without it.

So we were just in what I thought to be a committed relationship and then I became pregnant. I'm 100% pro choice, but I knew how he felt about kids and how much hed wanted one, so I decided we should make the decision together. I told him and we went from there. Wed been dating 6 months and had literally just said I love yous for the first time like a month before. 

We went through the pregnancy together. I quit stripping when I was 4 months along and got a civilian job. We were getting our ducks in a row, and we finally moved in together the month before my due date. 

That first month was fun, but I noticed he liked to drink. A lot. Like a 6 pack to himself everytime he drank. I told him to chill i know hes excited to have his own place again, and that the baby was coming, but i wanted him to be able to remember the birth of his child-- and be able to drive us to the hospital if need be. Long story short, I ended up being induced, had a normal hospital stay and th en was home. 

We originally planned for him to be home for a month, but he ended up being home for only 2 weeksishs. Luckily it was december, so most of the weeks were 3 day weeks and he was home the rest of the time. After he went back to work our relationship went slowly down hill. After I was let go from my job before returning from maternity leave it fell off a damn cliff. 

He drinks  A LOT. He'll bring home a 6 pack on Tuesdays, one on Wednesday, buy a 12 pack Thursday, finish the 12 pack from Thursday on Friday, buy another 12 pack Friday night and finish it, buy another 12 pack Saturday and finish it, drink beer all day Sunday, bring some home with him after bbqing all day, and then on Monday finish whatever is in the fridge. That's an average week. Sometimes it's more sometimes it's less. Sometimes he goes out drinking with his friends and comes home so wasted he passes out on the toilet. Those next days are so much fun. 

He just seems so unhappy to me, and I feel like it's because of me. I feel like hes drinking because he doesnt want to admit he doesnt like me anymore, and I've tried to talk to him about it, but he never says anything. But when hes drunk, his feelings come out.

Some things hes told me while drunk:
1 I dont show appreciation for all that he does for us.
2 he doesnt want me to go back to stripping because he would feel dirty laying in bed next to me after work.
3 actions speak louder than words, I'm a mooch and that's why I am having a hard time finding a new job after being let go.
4 he cant trust me because I spent all my tax return and baby shower money that was gifted to us. (I paid off our debts and have $1500 in savings)
5 I dont clean enough
6 I talk shit about his mom (I dont. I just complain about all the food she makes because we end up taking the leftovers home and it's so much we have to throw it away.)

What got me the most was the dirty comment. That to me just.... the best way to put it is how I understood it. 

I am the same exact person I was before. I still have the same morals and respect, so how would it be dirty now and not then? I'm not a different person, so why was I good enough to fuck around with, and now I'm magically good enough to make a life with? 

I guess to simplify it, now that you have background, am I wrong for not wanting to raise my daughter in the same house as him? 

I dont want to raise her to be ashamed of me or my past, because shell find out eventually, and I dont want to raise her in a house with a drunk. So would it be better to split and co parent?

 And in regards to the co parenting, his drinking scares me. He does mean shit when hes drunk sometimes. Hes screamed at our 6 month old baby to stop crying. And I mean SCREAMed. It scared me. I didnt know who he was for a second. And he just so nonchalantly tries to drive when we're leaving his parents house it worries me that hell drive drunk with her in the car. 

I really dont know what to do. I'm just so tired and I'm not sure if all the effort to leave would really make a difference. 

I love him, he gave me the greatest gift ever, but he is making my life so hard.",relationship_advice

t3_chpkhc,My wife is a creature of habit until she forgets what he habit is and starts a new one.,"It's an odd situation varying from the humourous to observe, annoying to be alongside and excessively aggravating to be blamed for. 

I have gone with an anonymous profile incase she recognizes the situations, but that is unlikely as I think this all stems from her being self-unaware.

The humourous examples are losing her keys constantly because she can never remember what ""her spot"". It takes her 15 min to leave the house sometimes (without the kids) because she keeps forgetting things.

The annoying is when she uses my toothbrush because she legitimately thinks it is hers. I suspect she uses my towel as well but that's a difficult thing to confirm. Sometimes it is wet/damp when I haven't had a shower yet that day.

The aggravating is being blamed for things that she has forgotten about doing or not doing, or whichever she thinks was my job which changed from when we divided the jobs. I realize that is a little vague but it is difficult to be more specific.

Having written all of the above I don't blame her for anything. She just seems unaware of how what she does affects people around her. Has anyone else had to deal with an unaware spouse? How do you manage? Nothing in this situation is a deal breaker, I'm just looking for how to deal with this.",relationship_advice

t3_chmt1l,Idk if this is a toxic relationship or if im just paranoid..,"So this is my first actual serious relationship. Im 19f, hes 24m. We met on tinder. Clicked instantly. He was living in a hotel (with his career, living in one is logical), me in my own apartment. Within 2 weeks he was suggesting moving in. I thought it was too soon but caved in about a month later. My family moved away and i would be struggling to buy food, do laundry, etc w/o transportation. Him moving in helped Alot. And things were going well so far. We had some issues here and there with me being close to my coworkers and the fact many of them were ex-felons and males so he refused to trust them (i worked at a food joint). 
We decided to move out of state so i could be near my family. He got a job out there. He said it was fine i wouldnt be working for awhile, i was gonna start college, needed to see the toll on me. I left state to see my other side of family for a month. Timing was bad cuz we didnt have a place yet. But the entire time i was there, he claimed i was acting different, wasnt being clingy anymore, wasnt calling enough (i texted Constantly to the point i felt rude to fam, i didnt feel like i was acting different). Even got pissed i visited my brother at his place cuz apparently me saying i was Only visiting my dad out there meant i could Only visit my dad and my brother shouldve came to my dads to see me instead of me to him. I missed my flight (bad planning), he flipped out and said he would leave me if i didnt get home (he said later that this was meant to get me to try harder). He helped buy a ticket for a week later. While i was there, he also kinda guilt tripped me over the fact he wasnt getting sex because i was gone (he still actually occasionally mentions this). tho it concerns me cuz he has said that is the Last time ill be allowed to go visit my family out of state without him, meaning if i ever wanna leave town like i do Every Single Year to visit them, i have to hope he'll have the money and time off work to go with me :/. 
I got home. Things were good for awhile. Hes so hot and cold tho. One day hes super sweet and the next, i feel like im on eggshells. I could make a noise at the wrong time, forget a small piece of info, and hes mad. Some examples: i was helping him fix his car depsite not knowing anything about it. He got snappy cuz hes told me that info 5 times so i apparently cant help. Even got snappy cuz i accidentally made a noise.---our dogs lease got caught on a candle pillar and scrapped it around in panic. In panic, he started peeing all over and escaped his leash also. My bf spanked his butt (lightly), but we both know this makes our dog panic and any situation worse. I asked him to not be so rough on him. He got pissed and said ""your really gonna get on me rn about being rough?""(i never touch our dog unless hes physically hurting me by being excited and jumping me, which i simply push him off me and say ""stop."") And i said he was being rude and he told me to ""get the fuck out of his face"". 
Ive been feeling like a burden lately cuz im not working. I have a job, they just havent started me. But im the sole cleaner of the house and cooker. I make sure dinners on the table, work lunch packed, house cleaned, animals fed, etc. But hes on me usually about something random not done. Like if im sleeping and the dog ate all his food, even if i filled it before bed. If he comes home and its empty, he'll throw snide comments at me about it, even if i explained i filled it before bed and just woke up. I addressed the burden issue and it got off topic after he said i wasnt a burden and such. I brought it back to topic since i didnt feel it had been Fully addressed and he suddenly got pissed i hadnt started the food i said i would start and said ""well i guess ill make the food since its taking so long and i gotta sleep before work soon"". And wouldnt let me step in to help cook it. 
He also does other things i dont like. Like if a girls walking in a store parking lot with super revealing clothes, he'll tell me they are sluts and such. Or if theres homeless, its ""why dont they get a job?"". I personally see 0 reason to judge people so this bothers me.
 Hes been cheated on by his ex wife mutiple times so he has alot of trust issues and hes gotten better at that Alot since we first started dating. But..
Usually hes super sweet to me. Hes the type whos let me go outside and cry on his shoulder cuz im depressed, making sure i have my meds for my depression, taking me to appointments, etc. When i thought i was pregnant, he was super supportive and said whatever i decide to do, he'll support me. Supporting me pursing a degree and supporting me despite me changing my mind 500 times on my major choice. Etc. Hes a very supportive person. Always wanting to move forward with me like randomly asking if i still wanna marry him or if i will or if ill have kids with him (he knows i dont want any of this for atleast another year but he knows i find it sweet to be told). Its just these cold streaks he has.. Idk if its the stress of being the sole provider right now, bills, were living in a crappy apartment where the landlord wont fix any issues, my job screwing me over right now, knowing no one here, my college screwing me over to, etc. 
I just cant tell if these are normal arugements in a relationship or abusive or what..",relationship_advice
t3_chmsvi,Why am I so upset about losing a girl who only ever wanted to use me?,"I don’t know why I’m so upset. Yes she was beautiful. Yes she was confident. Yes she was brilliant socially. But she was horrible to me. Now I look back on it I can clearly see that she was only ever feeding me breadcrumbs to keep me sticking around having sex with her, going on dates, talking about her issues, when she never had any intention of taking it any further with me. She’d always say just enough to make it acceptable for her to just bounce on me whenever she wanted but the manipulation and confusion really got to me. She’ll never take responsibility for what happened and it’s always my fault. 

So why am I so upset about losing her? She kept trying to keep little tabs on me by re-adding me on social media and she seemed to always know what was going on with my life. Even after she has ghosted me for 3 months. She had been keeping tabs the whole time. Until I deleted her off social media and she re-added me. She tried to friend zone me and I had to suck up everything and tell her no. She didn’t take that well at all. 

After all this I’m still really down on myself and blame myself for everything. Can’t stop thinking about if I’d done this differently or that differently or just played it a little more cool, it wouldn’t be this way. It’s really triggered my anxiety and depression and I’m not in a great place mentally tbh. Some days I feel like I should at least take it as a compliment that this stunning girl really wanted to sleep with me, but then some days I just feel like a total loser for her not wanting more with me and I must be really boring or unwantable or something.

Any advice or thoughts? Thanks for any replies I really appreciate it",relationship_advice
t3_chphwl,I (F/23) have trust issues with my husband (M/25) all due to his best friends.,"When we first got to know each other I genuinely thought he was a pretty good person but what really made me like him was how honest he seemed even when he knew it may not be in his favor. My husband has a clique of friends that he absolutely adores and he see them as his genuine brothers. I do not have any issues with that at all. But I recently discovered most of them are straight up cheaters. Literally one of them travelled with my husband and I and I read a convo between them during that time. One night his friend invited him to go out and hang out. I personally felt a bad vibe from his friend and felt uneasy about the guy so I insisted on going with him to which he said no he just wanted to hang out as guys. So whatever. In the messages though, the guy was planning to take my husband clubbing and even found some “girls” to take with them. 
the convo went like this

friend: “hey whose by u right now”
husband: “my wife obviously “
friend: calls husband for a couple of minutes 
call ends
friend:”listen theres women”
husband: “I don’t have money”
husband: “from where are the women???”
friend: “don’t worry about it”
husband:”forget it let’s just hang out just us guys”


When I asked my husband where him and the guy went he told me at his friends relatives house. 
Which turned out to be a damn lie, they went to some club and played poker. 
This is just one example. He has many friends who are married and talk about how they can’t wait to go on their trip and be with other women, My husband honestly has never said anything
he also usually doesn’t talk in the group chat when they send porno videos. 

I hate feeling uneasy because of his asshole friends but there’s a saying that your friends are a reflection of you .. Idc what he did in the past and I highly doubt he has cheated on me but I am always a bit uneasy because of how disgusting his “really close friends are”
How should I go about this and am I justified for feeling uncertain about his character ?",relationship_advice
t3_chph4x,Having a hard time trying to make the relationship more serious,"I (M25) have been talking to (F22) for a couple of weeks now. She is such a wonderful person and we get along amazingly. The problem I’m having is that we have a very similar sense of humour so we are constantly making weird jokes together and being sarcastic. We never have serious conversations because when they’re brought up, they are quickly brushed aside by whomever the topic is focused on because I’m assuming neither of us want to chance ruining our jokey type mood(were very similar). 

Now over text if I compliment her she never straight up accepts it so it makes me think she doesn’t really like being affectionate. I know she likes me though because she’s more open over text about her feelings. Saying things like she can’t wait to see me and saying she wants to cuddle at night time. The problem is when we meet in person. So we’ve gone out twice now and both times were a lot of fun but that’s because we just joke around and shoot the shit the whole time. Not once did we ever flirt back and forth. I tried to but it seemed like I was making the mood awkward by doing that so eventually I just stopped trying. After the first date I thought maybe it’ll be different on the second one. Over text it definitely was, she seemed a lot more into me and flirtatious. But the second date was even better in the sense of us getting along and laughing at how dumb we are but even less of a romantic feel to it. It’s been two days since the second date and talking to her over text she’s seeming very distant compared to how we would message before. (Also nothing physical happened after either date, she had work the next morning both times so she just said she was tired and needed to go home and then left promptly)

Now obviously I’ve got a lot of things running through my mind wondering what I should have done differently. Should I have just been less of a pussy and not worry about ruining the mood by being more bold during the conversations and given her a goodnight kiss before she left? 

I know she has a close guy friend that she has a similar jokey relationship with but he’s married. I’m worried I’ll fall into that category aswell despite wanting a more serious relationship with her.
Now what I’m really wondering is, should I confront her over text about what I’m feeling and try to clear the air? Would that make things worse for me? What’s your guys take on all of this? The way things are right now makes a third date seem like it’s out of the question.",relationship_advice
t3_chpf9u,Girlfriend thinks I'm being paranoid,"This was posted in AITA originally, reposted here because it was deleted

I really need help with this one as I'm honestly not sure where I stand. 

A little bit of background info:
Its my first ever relationship and I am now 22 years old, first ever girl I've kissed and all that. I'm quite insecure about myself (after I met her I ended up dropping out of my Navy enrolment to see where things lead and gained 25kg quite quickly), so I've not got much confidence to begin with in my body and how much I actually mean to people / whag my value is. 

This happened around 1 year ago, my girlfriend and I had been together around 7 months at this point.
She is studying in the UK from a different country and ended up going home for the holidays. Whilst she was home she booked a holiday with her best friend who is a guy, and it was just them two going on it. I was at first a little bit worried, but I thought ""It's cool, but I'd appreciate it if they slept in different rooms"" as she would have the exact same thoughts if it was me with a friend who is a girl. She ended up responding with ""okay I will try, but I'm not sure on accommodation"" as her friend was booking it.

A week or so later it turns out that he booked one room, so my next though was ""I guess that alright, but don't sleep in the same bed"" (and I'm sure any guy would think this...right?) so when the time comes around for their holiday I was excited for her, because she doesn't have many friends and I love it when she spends time with them, because it makes her so happy.

A night or so later I video call her (the connection is really bad where she went) and she shows me around the room. It turns out that the beds in the rooms weren't individual, but it looked like the hotel staff had pushed 2 beds together to make one, so I thought that's weird but they can just separate it to sleep differently. But they didn't do that. Instead they slept essentially in the same bed (I guess?) so at this point my mind was going all over the place. I was getting paranoid left, right and centre and when she video called me the following night she was under the covers with just her face showing (the covers were covering her chin partially) so this was a bigger red flag to me also. Me, being in this insecure and paranoid state asked to see under the covers... But aparantly that's where I went wrong.

To her, I broke all trust then by believing that something had happened between her and her friend. She occasionally brings it up in arguments as a point, and I think my suspicions were justified. 

I'm really struggling here so it would be real big help if you guys would give me some advice

AITA for thinking this?

Tldr; girlfriend went on holiday with guy friend, slept in the same bed and I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid about asking to see under the covers when she was under them

Edit: I'm not sure if the beds were separate and pushed together, but I've stayed in ones before that are double beds but with separate mattresses, so it looks like they were",relationship_advice
t3_chpf97,My (28m) GF (23f) Isn't Over Her Ex,"I feel like I met this girl at the wrong time. We have a ton in common, we work on the same field, we share a sense of humor - I felt like I'd known her my whole life a week after we met.  
 
We were friends for 3 years prior to dating. For most of that time she had a boyfriend who she eventually left for me - that wasn't planned, I was offered a job in another state on 2 weeks notice, things got said. The breakup was on good terms, turns out he was already planning to end things anyway - they loved each other but they didn't want the same things out of life.  
  
We went all in immediately. She kept her place but moved into mine, we met each other's families within a month, we got a dog, etc. It's been truly wonderful, mostly. 
 
She's, very understandably, not over her ex of 2.5 years that she broke up with the day before she moved in with me. That's caused some issues on both sides - the first time we had sex she orgasmed from PIV and she got mad at herself because she hadn't with her ex and ""it felt disrespectful to that relationship"", she wanted to keep a remarkable amount of memorabilia from him that I didn't love, she'd break down crying over a song or similar that they'd liked.  
 
We knew there'd be issues, we've worked through them. At first there was good ""progress"", she hasn't cried in months, she doesn't mention him anymore, etc. But it seems things have kind of plateaud. 10 months later she says she doesn't love him anymore and she doesn't want that relationship back, she doesn't even talk to him anymore, but that it still hurts that it's gone, she still gets sad sometimes. It's been that way for a while now, just kind of stuck at her being 95% here but I still feel like the other 5% is back in her previous relationship.

t3_chpdlj,Have I been exploited? or am I complicating things?,"Our friends set us up together, we met for few times, and I ended up asking her frankly if she is thinking about a relationship, she said she is not sure, she doesn't know me that well, and we should spend more time getting to know each other. She suggested meeting sometime before I travel back home (for winter break), few hours before meeting up she sent a message saying she will be too shy to meet me alone, but she said she wants to send something back home with me, so we met for few minutes, I pickup up the stuff and delivered the package, when I was back home we texted for a little bit, she asked me to bring stuff back for her. I met her mom and dad to pickup the stuff, and I met her when I got back to give her the stuff. After that she started acting weird, she ignored my phone call, but always called me back few days later, I met her with friends a couple of times after that. The last piece of interaction was as follows, she went in a trip back home, I called her when she got back, but she didn't answer, two weeks later she gave me a call, apologizing for being so busy. I told her I want to meetup, she said sure, let me check my schedule and I'll let you know. She never did, and now it's four month later and I'm so confused, why did she call me back? why did she make me meet her mom / dad? why did she disappear without saying anything?

t3_chpdch,"My (25M) dad (60M) is struggling with work and health issues. We've always had a good relationship, and I want to help/talk through these issues with him.","tl;dr: Dad is having some health/maybe alcohol related issues, not sure how to share my concerns on these issues in the most helpful way.

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says, I’ve always had a good relationship with my dad. He’s taught me many life lessons, we share some interests and hobbies, and routinely have a good time hanging out. However, he’s facing some issues that concern me, my mom and my sister-described below in detail.

&amp;#x200B;

For quick background, he was recently let go from a long-term job. I don’t know full details, but I do know it wasn’t due to anything major (blowout argument, harassment, etc.). From what I know, it sounds like performance issues due to complacency. He’s looking for a new job to work a few more years before retirement, but I’m not too worried about that-not much I could do to help with a job anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to the stuff that concerns me-where I feel like I can and need to help.

&amp;#x200B;

He has 2 bad knees and is overweight. This has been an issue for some years, but I’ve more recently noticed that his mobility is not good-struggling with stairs, etc. He does low-impact exercise pretty frequently (so he’s in decent cardiovascular shape), but the poor mobility is a little unnerving to me. He enjoys being somewhat active (travel, gardening, etc.), and I worry about his ability to do this in retirement without some improvements.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is the issue of alcohol. I would say he drinks 6 days out of the week, and a rough guess would be 5-6 drinks or more an evening. This includes a fair amount of liquor later at night (sipping tequila, not taking shots-as if it makes a difference anyway). He also seemingly hides the amount of liquor he consumes (conceals his full-ish glass, has a hidden stash of bottles, etc.), so on some level he must know this is wrong. I’m not sure if he’s spoken with his doctor about this alcohol use and the impact it likely has on his weight. While employed, he would also regularly sleep in late (hours were kinda flexible)-but I’m worried that if a new job has different morning expectations, this will be a challenge for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to address these with my dad, since I feel that they’re all interrelated-improving health and alcohol use would help him at work and in retirement. He’s worked hard during his career to save for a decent retirement, and I really want to see him enjoy the fruits of his labor with my mom. We all love dad, and we want him to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m at a loss here. I feel comfortable discussing this stuff with my dad (and I think he'll take it okay at least), but I’m not sure how to frame it. I want what I say to be impactful without it being a lecture. Anyone gone through anything similar or have advice on how to frame such a discussion?",relationship_advice
t3_chktgn,Having a rough patch with my girlfriend.,"We come from the same small town and recently moved to Stockholm together. Before that we travelled 5 months abroad. 

Somewhere on this trip we started being petty and fight somewhat more. As I said we moved in together and everything seemed fine for a bit. We don't really do the sex since she's never been fully comfortable with it, leaving me sometimes frustrated. 

We're both quite hot delivered and the smallest things tend to blow up. She has a bossy very structural personality while I'm more of a take the day as it comes kind of guy. 

Anyway, recently we discussed doing a semester abroad and she pruposed having an open relationship to help get over the sex choking point. 
I'm not sure how to feel about this and why she feels so much pressure with me in particular.


She means the world to me and we still have good fun together, however just this morning we argued about something minor and I was tired and didn't really pay attention, I also have trouble listening to someone that starts the conversation with such an aggressive tone (even though she doesn't mean it, It's just the way she was raised, quite bossy family being right all the time). I called her mommy (yeah I know) and started to do the things she wanted done. She then said someting like I didn't care about her (trust me, I'm the showing emotions person in this relationship) and so I got mad with her. Ended in her walking straight up to me and smacking me saying I bully her psycologically and I punched a freakin' hole in the bathroom door, not my proudest moment, hurt myself while doing it too.

I'm not an idiot and I know this wont last in It's current state. I'm tired of bustin my ass and then come home to a fight over dishes.

t3_chp9gd,"Emotionally abusive boyfriend, or just lack of trust?","So I've been dating with my (now I guess ex) for half a year, the relationship went mostly online, long hours of video calls, and then we met for 2 weeks. I can't describe with words how beautiful it was, he was super caring and sometimes when we had fights he started to cry, we cried together and always worked everything out. He was everything I wanted from my future husband. I know that he has very strong feelings for me, (and so do I.) 

And that's the problem. He is extremely jealous, I cannot even innocent text my male friends, he asks about every single guy I ever mentioned, he stalks my messages and when I even slightly mention something that goes against our relationship (even though it's a joke and he knows it), he gets extremely mad, to the extent when he emotionally abuses me. (He tells me he's gonna leave me just so I can ""enjoy"" my time with my male friends. And if I want him, I should be 24/7 available for him - he didnt say this but you get the idea) He wants me to suffer because of him, because presumably I make him suffer too (because I text my male friends and sometimes ""ignore"" his messages - I'm busy and can't text him straight away). However it never got as bad as today, he calls me names, including swearwords, which really does hurt me since I've never thought he would do something like this. What is more he created a bunch of fake profiles of me and is contacting my friends as well as random guys offering my nudes including my phone number, he has sent me some of those pictures and said he's gonna spread it all over. I know this behaviour is absolutely inacceptable, psycho and dumb. (He would say: but you enjoy talking to guys, so there you go, I make it easier for you.) But at the same time I know how strong his feelings to me are, and I think he is doing that because he is hurt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I do love him, and I know he loves me too, way too much, I think he is doing this as a ""revenge"" for me not behaving the way he is expecting me to, and he also doubts my feelings for him all the time, even though I have proved him many times that I only love him.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is absolutely not okay, but I'm just wondering if there's a way to fix him? If I should still try to talk it all through with him? I know this relationship is toxic, but I'm just worried I'll never find anyone else who can love me the way he did, or still does. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or is there a possibility that it's my fault because I constantly keep talking to/calling my male friends and if I wanna be with him I should give it up? I've never cheated on him and I always keep him updated about what I talk about with them (he wont act normal until I do.) - I'd also like to mention that the men I talk to are mostly online too, and I don't spend with them more than a couple minutes per day, but yeah, sometimes it interrupts the time I ""should"" be calling him.

All help is really appreciated!

t3_ch5qpm,My (17F) boyfriend (19M) acted super weird after sex.,"He’s always seemed like a sweet guy, and I had a crush on him for a long time. We have been dating for 3 months, and last night we had sex together for the first time. I have only slept with one other person before him. However he has slept around a tad bit. We’re talking 7 partners. He said a couple things during that were odd to me but I just let him do his thing. The one that stuck in particular was “I’d let you shit in my f’ing mouth”. He finished in seconds, and I asked if he would finish me with his fingers and he said “what’s the matter cheddar biscuits, didn’t get your fill?” And then straight up open palm smacked my titty. It hurt, and he just kind of stood there. I was shocked and I asked why in the world he would do that. He didn’t have an answer, he just said he didn’t know. 

I am horribly turned off by this, would I be a bad person if I break things off? Even if everything else is perfect?

EDIT: What in the world is a cheddar biscuit? I’m googling it to see if it’s slang for anything but all I’m finding is literal biscuits made with cheddar cheese and stuff about the Green Bay Packers.

However, when I got home and was ironing my gown, my Mother started scolding me for switching on all the lights in the house - I reasoned it was as I can’t see if I was ironing or burning my gown. She scolded me for doing it so last minute and I told her it was cause I was rather busy the whole week. She then said, “But you’re so free to busybody and care about other people but your family and your own things you don’t care.” She said it in a very mean and harsh tone. 

And to be honest, before I got home I was already in a rather upset/depressive state because of some previous issues. When I burnt my pinky on the iron, I started crying because I’ve had so much built in over the past shitty week I had and I kept telling myself not to cry cause I don’t want to look like a swollen puffball tomorrow. 

But I couldn’t help it and cried anyway. When I cried and cried, my Mother noticed and just screamed at me, “Don’t come act all pitiful in front of me”. She then threw a cream at me and it hit me. 

At the point in time, I really felt so depressive I really want to die. Heck, I really do want to die right now. What’s the point when I feel so unloved? Its like nobody really cares about me. So what if I live? Everybody puts so much pressure on me but do they even truly love me. It’s my special day tomorrow but no one really cares.

t3_chp785,Me and my girlfriend just got into a fight over our Halloween plans.,"Earlier tonight, my girlfriend of a year and a half came to me and told me that we're going to a costume party for Halloween. The people hosting the party held a party last year and we went to that as well, the theme being celebrities. That wasn't so bad since a lot of people have told me that I look like Matt Damon and I just trimmed my hair a little shorter and put on some generic clothing. Still, the hosts of the party are friends with my girlfriend and I honestly don't like them. They remind me of Bob and Midge from That 70's Show and I can't stand them. This year they're hosting another party and the theme is comic book movies. I personally don't like comic book movies and I'm honestly baffled by this generation's sudden fascination with being nerdy and making geekiness a mainstream thing.

My girlfriend told me that we're going and that she's going to buy me a costume. She said that she wants us to be a comic book couple, but I've told her that I don't want to go. I told her that I don't like her friends and that I also don't like dressing up for Halloween. She says that it's ""tradition"" for us to go even though we've only gone to one of their parties and I responded by telling her that she can survive going without me, which pissed her off.

She told me that I'm going no matter what and I really want to get out of this. Halloween just isn't for me and I don't want to be surrounded by a bunch of stupid comic book nerds.

I'm enjoying it so far.  I'm not a nurse of some kind, I am just cleaning tables, serve food and talk with the eldery who live there. Its from 4.30pm to 7.30pm always. 

But now its summer vacation and the management hired some vacation workers. They usually work in the early mornings but sometimes they work in the evening aswell. I knew that there were 2 new female workers because it was written on papers and such.
The vacation workers always wear a blue shirt so I can recognize them. I can wear whatever I want (casual outfit)

So here is where the story starts. I went to work and did my thing but than I saw a girl with a blue shirt. She started working at 4.45pm. She was talking with an lady so she was standing with her back against me. I had to clean the table so its was quite a coincidence. I said hey and she introduce herself to me. We had a quick chat about when she started to work and she asked some things back. 

The people eat at 5.00pm so I helped the nurses and she helped aswell. After that I said if she is hungry you can grab some food. We had little chats and she laughed a couple of times and we were just having a conversation about school and stuff. I offered her some drinks and after that we watched tv with all the eldery who live there. 

I served the people some drinks and she offered to help me and so she did.

Later she was on her phone and I goofed about that I have to do everything (totally not a problem) she offered to help and I said im fine with a big smile and later we had a chat.

She wasnt avoiding me and she was very kind and beautiful. The first impressions were great. The problem is that the vacation workers are flex workers in the evening but they do have a morning schedule. I dont know when I am going to see her again because I only work in the evenings.

I also dont know if she has a boyfriend or not so thats also kinda a thing.

I have no relationship/dating experience and sometimes I'm quite insecure. Sorry for bad english.

I really want to know her surname and maybe phonen number but I dont want to be a creep so I have to to it smart. Any suggestions?

Tldr; met cute girl at work. I like her but i dont know if she likes me. I want to have her number or insta.",relationship_advice
t3_chp20w,My (17M) girlfriend (16F) has guys who are into her get her drugs and alcohol for free.,"Before I start, yes I know we’re dumb teenagers. I don’t want to hear anything about ‘drugs are bad’ or ‘you’re to young to be drinking’. I could really care less and will ignore these comments.

Now, my girlfriend and I both smoke weed and drink. Before we started dating she would lead guys on for free shit. She’s never done anything for it, just leads them on. Honestly if I was a girl and single I would do the same thing so I didn’t judge her for this.

There are a few guys who still give her free stuff because there into her, she doesn’t flirt with them or lead them on anymore but I still don’t like it. for example there’s a guy who she’s getting free stuff from but he said she has to hang out with him for an hour. he is 3 years older and lives almost an hour away. This really freaks me out because

1) he lives a fucking hour away and is driving all the way to give someone free drugs

2) he said she HAS to hang out with him for an hour or he won’t give her anything.

3)he is 19 while she just turned 16

I don’t know what i’m supposed to do because she is planning on doing it and i have voiced my concern to her. she said she needs it by tomorrow and it’s her only way because she doesn’t get paid until saturday. she agrees that it’s creepy but is still doing it. Should I let this be bothering me as much as it is? Is there anything I should say to convince her to not go?

Edit: I convinced her so we’re good, i was scared to bring up the rape thing because of things. But when i voiced that she understood 

Sorry for all the people this annoyed the hell out of lmao. i understand we are both stupid teenagers.

also, this doesn’t happen often at all, it’s happened one other time in the 10 months we’ve been dating and that time it was dropped off.",relationship_advice

t3_chp041,My boyfriend is freaking out,My(22F) boyfriend(24M) is freaking out because there is a good chance that he is going to fail a required class for his degree program. If he fails he is likely to be asked to leave the program. The main stressor is that his current job is stipulated on him completing his degree. If he loses his job his apartment and car would follow and he would be in a lot of student debt. I don't know how to best support him in this. He continues to talk in a way that frightens me and I worry that he will do something drastic that would cause harm to himself. I don't want him to stop talking to me about what he's going through but it is very difficult and slightly triggering for me. I just don't know what to do or how to help him.

t3_chozxi,Should I confess or leave him alone?,"There's a boy i like. we were friends 2 years back but decided to part our ways after a month due to some reason. He even suggested that we should stay as stranger from then. He was in a relationship at that time. We started talking again from last 4 days. I got to know that they broke up and that he regrets what happened between us in the past (we kissed a couple of times). 

Right now he's very sad and became a bit self consumed. He does not have any problem when i talk to him. We enjoy a lot when we talk to each other right now. he also said that he feels sad about suggesting me to be strangers and that we have a bit of similarities (he said i was the first one of that kind in his life).

I want to know that-

1. should i confess to him that i like him and that we should consider being in a relationship.
2. should i just stop talking to him so that he forgets about me and feel less burden about us.",relationship_advice
t3_chozqe,"I (F,20) didnt greet my father (M,57) on his birthday.","Little backstory.

My father and I have a complicated relationship. Since I inherited his lack of patience and ego, we always fight. We never really had a common ground when we fight. Usually we never really resolved things by talking. It always ended with him getting physical or verbally aggressive with me. When i was younger, naturally my angsty teenage brain didnt understand why parents get mad for simple things. Of course now that I am 20, i try to see things their way. 

My father was born poor but he strived to carry his own weight and achieve in life. I guess that's where some of his pride come from. He really did great though. Travelled Europe and most parts of our country, all expenses paid by his employers. When i was in highschool, his company went bankrupt. He didnt find work for a long time but he always manage to help around the house or give money. Me and my sister didnt really mind yknow. Since my mom had a huge steady income. But I felt like sometimes he feels low because he isnt the one providing the bigger income or doing ""women work"" around the house. Sometimes he projects his insecurities unto us.


Whenever we fight, I try to calm down and talk to him. But the ""I am your father talking back to me is disrespect"" card is always used. I dont have any problems like this with my mother. When we fight, we usually talk sincerely with each other and help each other understand both sides.

Recently, we had a big fight. I tried to talk to him calmly and rationally so that I could understand why he was so angry. But nothing changed, he still spoke to me as if i was just a child, threatened to take my dog away and disown me. It ended with me crying in my room for a long time. Trying to figure out why I had such a compicated father.

Yesterday was his birthday and since our fight was still fresh. I didn't greet him when I came back home from school. My mom is now texting to me and my sister why didnt do so and it was such a huge thing for her and my father. 

I want to make peace and have a better relationship with my father. But if talking with him won't work, i dont know what else will. 

Any advice?

Tldr: My dad and i had a huge fight a few days before his birthday, neither me or my sister greeted him.",relationship_advice
t3_chehrx,I’m (26M) slowly loosing interest in my newly married wife (22F),"I’m writing this with an heavy heart hoping to find a way to over come my struggle. I know that I might be the asshole here but I want to find a solution for this ongoing issue that I can’t open up to anyone I personally know. 

Me and wife got married recently about 10 months ago, after 1 year of dating. I know it’s a short time but we were so happy with each other and decided to get married. I don’t wanna disclose our names but here’s a little about us, I’m 27, have a Graduate Engineering degree, a decent job, not religious or you could say an agnostic atheist, kinda nerdy and liberal. My wife is 22, she’s from a very conservative family (No make ups, skirt wearing and God is everything motto), didn’t go to school after 5th grade and had a very bad childhood cos of her stepmom. She isn’t religious  and she’s kind of a rebel in her family, She’s very naive but smokes weed which her family hated and has been dealing with depression and anxiety issues. She haven’t been in a serious relationship before me  while I had been in a 4 year and 3 years relationship before I met her. She is a big girl and was 250 lbs when we dated and I’m 145lbs. We have a lot of differences but opposite poles attracts each other. 

The things I didn’t know about her are that she’s a little jealous, has deep insecurities about her weight and although she isn’t religious I didn’t realize she had those roots in her. Fast forwards to after marriage, she slowly brought up about her discomfort with me watching music videos cos of the short dresses girls wear in those and wanted me to watch only the lyrical videos. I don’t care for those girls or nudity but I was shocked to know that she has issues with that. Then it progressed into a big fight when she asked me to give up on my favorite tv show the Game of Thrones cos of the nudity in that. She pretty much accused me of being a pervert for watching shameless. It really bothered me cos she knew Hame of Thrones was my fav show right since when we dated and that I had been waiting for the final season for a couple of years only to ask me to give up on it. So now I’m not allowed to watch most of the tv shows and music if there’s a girl with some level of nudity. Pretty much my wife has put a parental control on me at the age of 27. 

Although I was totally furious about that, we sat and spoke and I learned that this was cos of her insecurities and she feels deeply hurt when I come across other naked women and that it makes her feel like she’s not good enough. So I agreed on giving up on that as she’s far more important than a tv show although it hurt me cos of the way she was looking at things. While all of this is happening, we had a few fights when I tried to ask her about her weight and encouraged her to loose weight. She refused to tell me her weight until recently and gets deeply upset if I ask about it. In my view, that’s a main reason for her insecurities and I would like her to work on it. 

This is when all the problems started. Health wise, she has been facing issues with cavities cos of her soda or sweet tea habits. So I asked her to reduce that and switch to water. We had to have 2 of her teeth’s crowned in this one year and the dentist advised her the same. That didn’t go well. Secondly she is 22 and has knee pains and back pains, and again I have asked her to go to gym with me and I’ll help her to work out with me. She agreed, and I bought her a membership and had been paying for it ever since, but she didn’t go after the first 3 days. I didn’t go well again when I asked her to go after that. While health wise we had these issues, sexually our relationship started declining drastically. She gained a few more now and is about 275lbs. I don’t wanna get into the details, but we can’t have sex in any other but one sex position cos of her overweight. It really took a turn on me. So I got depressed and finally one day opened up to her about it. That day she agreed with everything I said and said she will work on it. But then never did anything, and when I asked about it she got very upset and threw a “ You married me for what I’m, don’t try to change me”, after entirely changing my hobbies to the shows I watch. I don’t expect her to loose weight and turn 180 lbs over night or be a model or anything. But I do expect her to give up on some bad habits like eating ice creams every night, constantly being on sugar waters like Sweet tea and smoking weed every night and ending up eating a bunch of deserts. Nothing of this worked when I directly told her to do something about it. She either ignores it or cries when I say anything about this. All of this made me sexually loose interest in her entirely and I’m guilty enough to say that she doesn’t turn me on a bit. Our sex lives sucks at this point, as she’s a girl with high sex drive only to me be not interested in her. We are aware of the issues we have sexually, but I have not told her that I’m not interested in her and had been giving reasons like I’m tired every time she asks for sex. I don’t even know what to do and where to go from here. I don’t know if I should change and accept the way she is or if I’m being an complete asshole for asking her to loose weight. Despite all of this, I love her to the core and she loves me more than anything. We both still want to live with each other and have no intentions of leaving each other but I don’t know how long I can go like this. Sorry for the long posts but I would really appreciate any advices. TIA.",relationship_advice
t3_chnbpg,How to repair and proceed with damaged relationship ?,"So last year in Toronto (where I live) I met this awesome girl (23) from Holland who comes to Toronto every summer to see family. I only got to chill with her the final 2 weeks of august, but every time we were together it was so genuine and fun. After the first date, she was basically hooked to me. Her friends would ask if she wanted to hang out, but she always carved out time for me over them which is weird because I only had 1 date with this chick. Guess I got her attention :) Before she left back to holland, I told
her we should be exclusive when she comes back (in summer 19’) and she was down with it. 

This where I made the mistake🤦🏻‍♂️. I told my friends that we hooked up and basically boasted about it because they’re all like she’s so hot! It’s felt awesome getting the validation of “damn you got with here?!😮😏👌🏻”

Fast-forward to the past 3 weeks, she’s back and catches wind of the word that spread and is super pissed saying I’m disrespectful and such and such. I continue to deny I told people anything.. 

What should I do??? I don’t want to waste this opportunity again.",relationship_advice
t3_ch9wl1,Am I [28M] wrong to have left her [25F]?,"Dated a girl for 5 years and just left her a few weeks ago because we never had sex. It was too much to go through more than half my twenties without sex. She would routinely say things like ""Idk I just don't see the point or feel the need"" which made me sick to my stomach. She said she eventually want kids but throughout the nearly 6 years of hanging out and 5 years of dating the furthest we have gotten is oral which she thoroughly disliked. Basically the last year of our relationship was just talking about sex and nothing else and I decided I was literally just bored of it.   


The catch is she's literally perfect besides what's written above. She's never mean, super attractive and fit, incredibly loyal (probably in part because she doesn't like sex), friendly, fun to hang out with, easy to please, lives the same lifestyle as me (simple and minimalistic), clean, organized, smart, etc. I told her so many times that I am not able to stay if she's not going to have sex and she just kept saying ""someday we will"".

t3_chowdn,She missed the birthday party :(,"So this has been going on for a year. My MIL lost her job, doesn’t contribute to any household chores and wakes up at 4 or 5 pm. Her spouse literally does everything for her (from cooking to brushing her hair). She missed her granddaughter’s first birthday party last week because she literally takes 7 hours to do anything and just sits and plays on her phone. 

The day after she missed my daughter’s party she asks like nothing is wrong. She has been prescribed antidepressants but barely takes them/takes them inconsistently and won’t go to talk to someone. 

What do we do? Stage an intervention? It’s really hard to be sympathetic and compassionate when she can’t even muster the energy to take the pills that might make her feel better.",relationship_advice
t3_chov9f,I moved to a different country to live with my bf and now we are having troubles.,"I (F18) moved from NYC to Belgium to live with my bf (M21). We met online through a social platform and I fell in love with him really quickly. He was such an amazing guy. July of 2018 he flew to meet me in person and it was the best month of my life. About 8 months after the visit I decided I want to move to live with him in Belgium. My parents weren't too happy with that because I'm so young and I've never even been to the country and if I made a mistake there was no way I could go back to the US to be with my parents again.

&amp;#x200B;

Important note about myself: I was born in Israel and me and my parents moved to NYC when I was 3 so we were illegal immigrants in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

A main reason why I really wanted to move was because things back home weren't going very well. My mother and I never had the best relationship and she was mentally and physically abusive towards me, so when my bf offered for me to move and legally live with him, I couldn't say no. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, when I moved to Belgium it was tough but I got used to it. But day by day me and my bf have an insane amount of fights. He really really insults me and he hurts my feelings and he claims i'm lying to him even though his memory is really bad because he has ADHD. He has never complimented me and he doesn't really show affection towards me. He's never bought me flowers despite the amount of times that I hinted at it or even asked him if he would be able to. He comes home from work and he goes right on his computer to play video games. And the thing that scares me the most is how violent and aggressive he is. He would smash his fists against the table, insult me and threaten to bash my skull in and knock my teeth out. Now yes, some fights we have do go out of hand and I insult him back but he takes things way too far and i'm really afraid that one day he may actually bash my skull in. He is a really aggressive person and it takes me back to how I lived back with my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we are on the process of having me legalized here in Belgium which is great but now I'm really stuck. I don't feel comfortable being around him.. I can't go back to America because they wouldn't let me go back considering I don't have a US passport and Israel will deny me a visa since I lived there illegally. I also can't go back to Israel because I have no family there and I don't know the language or the country itself and if I do go back to Israel then I won't be able to see my parents in over 10 years. I also have no friends here in Belgium that I can go to, to get away. I am stuck. I don't know what to do. We would make up but then he would get furious at me again and the insults and threats continue. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- I moved to Belgium from NYC to live with my bf I was in love with to get away from my toxic home and now my bf is being super aggressive and threatening towards me and I can't leave because I don't have a US passport and I can't go to my home country because I have no family there.",relationship_advice
t3_chn8bw,Is my [20M] girlfriend [19F] crazy or am I?,"Very long post, TL;DR at the bottom.


So me and my girlfriend have been together for almost a year and a half now and since the beginning we had our differences. She has a really volcanic temperament and tends to get really angry from small things (for example, at some point me and some friends were waiting for her to finish her cigarette and get in the car and I said ""see, if u didn't smoke we could have gone by now"" in a playful way, just to make conversation (note that I don't mind her smoking one bit, and she knows that) but she got really mad and didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and the next day until I apologized for like 100 times. We always fight from the most stupid things and I kind of got used to it until some really odd stuff happened since two or three months ago. Now that you got the general idea bear with me because it's only going south from here.

One of the biggest and weirdest fights we had was about me not minding gay people and her pretty much hating them. When I was around 13-14 years old I had to kiss a boy in a dare game and I've always been cool with relationship between the same sexes (note that I am 100% straight). We had a little debate about why we have these opinions and during the conversation I brought up the experience mentioned above. This led to us almost breaking up just because I had a different opinion that hers and because she couldn't accept my past (I had no problem with her opinion though and I just wanted to understand her reasoning but it escalated beyond expectations). We somehow managed to fix it after two or three days of fighting and moved on. I hoped that we established that I am completely straight after this whole ruckus but boy was I mistaken. 

One of my friends needed some advice regarding a girl he liked, so during a week we met two or three times around 12am in our neighborhood so we could talk about how things are going between them and what he should or shouldn't do. I told my girlfriend every time what I was doing, where I was and with who. In the last meeting I had with my friend I got caught up in the discussion and I forgot to respond to her messages for about an hour or so. When I got home, I apologized but, now get ready for this one, she accused me for being gay with my friend. I thought she was joking at first but she was dead serious. I tried to explain that is utterly untrue but again, we ended up fighting for a day or two before fixing it. 

Now for a change of pace. We  got together to go at my place. On the way to the subway, we had an argument. I can't really remember about what but I remember it was really insignificant. During arguments I tend to not get angry and just try to make the other person understand my point of view and why I think theirs is wrong (I am totally ready to accept I am mistaken if they prove me, of course). During the argument at some point, she says ""ok I am going home if you don't stop"". She looked pretty serious so I told her that it's just a contradictory discussion about something not important, even if we don't agree it doesn't mean you have to react like that. After asking her not to go for a few times she proceeds with  leaving. I was kind of bamboozled because it got out of my hands real quick. After thinking for a minute or two I ran after her and at that moment I kinda lost it. I caught up to her, stopped her and started the most brutal rage in my life I think. I started screaming at her that I don't think this is normal and I think she shouldn't run from her problems, and that if something bothers her we should try and fix it, talk about it, not just give up and not talk with each other.   I think this was not ok from my side either, I mean, we were in middle of the street and people were watching me screaming at my girlfriend but I couldn't control myself. I hugged her and apologies after but it really pissed me off in that moment. We worked through this one too. But a few days ago I think this was my last drop.

So I was away in another city on a workshop with my university and I thought maybe she and my friends could come at the end of my workshop and spend another day here. All nice and well until we had to find a place to stay.We all wanted to take a room for all 4 of us but my girlfriend insisted on having a separate room with me so we could have sex. I told her I want that too but I was a little short on money so I asked her to go with the bigger room because it was more advantageous and when we get home we'll have all the sex she wants.  I guess you can already figure out she didn't take it so well. After literally begging her not to, she cancelled the whole trip just because this reason. ""Ok, if that's what you wish and I can't convince you cancel it and I'll see you when I come back...I am really sorry and I wish you would've come though"" is what I said. After a day or two from this incident we had another argument about something unimportant after which she said ""everything you do annoys me, change or we won't work"". This really opened my  eyes. She always tried to change me more or less but I just hoped she will someday accept me as who I am. But I am really sick of this. I am sure we can work this one out too, but I made up my mind and I wanna break up with her because it's getting really toxic for both of us and I think it would be better like this. What do you guys think?


TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend are fighting a lot from unimportant stuff and I am thinking about leaving her because it would be better for both of us. She accused me for being gay and cheating on her with my friend, she never tries to talk about our problems and she doesn't accept who I am.",relationship_advice
t3_chosoj,Can I salvage my relationship?,"I’ve (17m) been dating my girlfriend (15f) for a few months now and mostly everything is fine, with the exception of my ex girlfriend (17f). A few months ago, I broke up with her and almost immediately entered a new relationship. There’s still emotional baggage there and while my current girl friend is gone for the entire summer, I’ve been hanging out with my ex girlfriend as friends. 

I haven’t cheated, but like I said I don’t think we’re completely over each other, despite making sure not to cheat. I know, it’s bad and I should probably stop hanging out with her altogether for now. 

Anyway, yesterday I was with my ex walking around, saw my girlfriends friends, and broke off with my ex gf, to avoid conflict or drama. Of course, they saw that and obviously it looks very suspicious and told my girlfriend all about it... 

I know I’m stupid for panicking and breaking away, and stupid for just trying to be my ex girlfriend’s friend, but it’s not like I cheated or did anything too bad... 

I love my girlfriend and she’s very angry and upset, as you’d expect. Should I tell her anything? Or should I leave her alone and accept whatever she decides?

t3_chor7p,How do I get over this one kiss?,"Ok, so here we go. My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years after one year the distance became long-distance. Reddit, I don't know what else to say, I know people are gonna say it's the typical cheesy story and all that bs. The cheesy stuff is cheesy because it's true. She's smart funny and we love all the same stuff down to the really weird stuff like favorite insane YouTubers and all that. I've always told her communication is key and we've been pretty good about it. On and off for the past two long-distance years, she and I have had stupid, petty fights that we knew were dumb and we would never have in person. In-person we're amazing as well as the distance, I imagine though that it's natural for us to get into these petty fights due to the frustration of being long-distance. That's why we always came back and brushed them off. The thing is Reddit, we had a petty fight last week that reached a place it shouldn't have and then she broke up with me but it was a break up during the heat of the argument that I felt she didn't mean.

We gave each other some space for about a week and then after a week, it was her birthday. I sent her a birthday text and she simply ""loved it"" as in the message and then sent ""thank you, love you too"" I couldn't take it anymore, I texted her and for some reason she just kept telling me to move on and I kept thinking how is it that after a week she's speaking to me like I'm some stranger? Then she proceeded to call herself a shitty person and that I deserve better. I kinda kept pushing with my words as in I just kept kinda asking why she was acting like this and I told her she's the only one for me. She got mad and said I always put her on a pedestal and she's a shitty person and not as great as I think she is. Reddit she and I are good loyal people, and the thing is, her life after she had to move is not a great one, she graduated, moved away from all her friends, she is now working two jobs and paying off loans, her parents are always fighting and her dad is a very strict and religious dad who basically doesn't let her have a life at all. She even told me how she thinks she's a shitty person because of how much she's lied to her dad and the reason she lies to him is about stuff like going out and all that. Her dad is a control freak and that was something we also bonded over, our parents never let us do anything in high school and in college, we only got a smaller amount of freedom opposed to that. She has very few friends and yeah barely ever hangs out with those friends as it is. She is constantly paranoid of her dad finding out about us. It's messed up because sadly her household is one where the dad's approval is what matters, her mother and sisters know about me and love me. This made her love for me even stronger.

After I texted and pushed her enough because I was so confused and not about to let it end like that, she finally came out and sent a long text that started out with ""I let another guy kiss me"" she said she regretted it the second it happened, she only has feelings for me, she felt like shit, she's disgusted with herself and hates herself, and she was questioning how could I be with someone like her. Reddit idk if anyone else feels this way but the last fucking thing I wanted to know were the details but I still had to ask for some sort of closure, I asked how and where did it happen, she said he snagged one from her just before she and her girl friend were leaving. I asked how long it was and all that crap and she said not long but she wanted to stop talking about it because it made her feel gross. I respected that and I told her that it was ok, it was just a kiss. She doubts that I'm this calm with it but she said she hopes I keep true to my promises and never bring it up or any of that. Guys, I love her so much and she's living and incredibly hard life out there, and technically she and I were broken up for a week and it happened about two days before I texted her again and we had this conversation. Reddit I feel like I made the right decision but how do I get the thoughts of this asshole kissing her? He's into her and she said she's not going to entertain him or let him believe he has any chances. How do I get myself over this one little kiss? She's going through a lot and the last thing I want to do is dump her and make her mental health even more unstable than it is. I don't want to break up with her, she's the one for me, but how do I get this one little kiss out of my head? How do I stop letting these thoughts take over? I can't stop the paranoid thoughts of her maybe secretly enjoying that kiss? I can't stop thinking about how trust was kind of broken but I guess technically we were broken up, it's obviously just irritating because it was literally five days after we broke up and we usually come back to one another. She said she let him kiss her but he kinda just went for it and caught her off guard, she didn't insinuate it or anything. In her long text she kept telling me how awful she felt and that she recognizes how I only want her but she was having slight doubts about us and then after that she asked me how could I want to be with someone like that?  This isn't something that I ever thought we would have to deal with. I know that technically trust isn't broken, she once felt guilty and facetimed me one day about a work party the night before where a guy tried to get a kiss from her but she backed off and said she has a bf. She facetimed me telling me that and said she didn't want to keep anything. Guys what do I do, I don't want to let her go and she doesn't want me to either, I handled the situation in a mature manner but that was through texting, texting doesn't show my inner thoughts. Please help me.",relationship_advice
t3_chn5lw,I (19F) sent a snapchat to a guy (20M) that I have been hooking up with 6 days ago and he still hasn’t answered. Has he lost interest?,"I met a guy back in April after we both recently got out of 2 year relationships. We hooked up the night be met and then we continued a confusing relationship from then on. It was confusing bc we never talked about what we were; we would do date-like activities but also we were not exclusive. He did ask me what my relationship goals are tho and I said I can’t think about anything serious for a few months and he agreed. He genuinely got to know me tho and it seemed like he cared about me. He even said once “If we ever stop hooking up promise me that we will stay friends.” 

Right now we aren’t close to each other bc I live in NY and he lives in CT. His family is a military family so he moves around a lot. He told me he was lonely bc he doesn’t know anyone in his neighborhood and there aren’t many places to meet new people. Recently, he told me he reconnected with two girls from his childhood so maybe he is hanging out with them but I’m not sure if they live close. Anyway, the point is I know he doesn’t have many friends so it’s confusing to me why he is just randomly ignoring me. We’ve seen each other 2 times this summer and I thought it went well. But shortly after the second time I saw him, he dramatically decreased his contact with me. Previously he had been texting me everyday but then he reduced it to once a week. I noticed this and I took a hint and stopped trying to initiate contact as much. He would then snapchat me something random I guess to contact me but then I’d try to continue a conversation and we would go back and forth 2-3 times and then he would leave me on open. 

Now, I snap chatted him last Friday and he still hasn’t opened it. I’m honestly kind of offended bc I’ve seen he has been on snapchat and he is just blatantly ignoring me. He doesn’t use social media a lot so I know my notification is prob like the second or third from the top. Has he lost interest in me? Is he trying to get me to take a hint? What should I do? 

Also is it dramatic that I kinda just want to cut off contact with him? ***Something important to note: he knows my ex ghosted me at the end of our relationship so I think what he is doing is shitty and is why I’m so offended***",relationship_advice
t3_chn5jr,Where to start..,"

A TLDR to start cause literally no one will read this:
My best friend was catfished by another friend who’s also a petty criminal, they’re hanging out a lot and it’s all my friend can talk about and I can’t fucking stand it. 

I (26f) have this friend (26f-we’ll say Rachel) whom I’ve been best friends with for quite some time. We’ve had our ups and downs but I biggest down was due to a disagreement about another friend (25f-we’ll say trish). 

Rachel and I have been really good friends for a really long time, and halfway through that time, Rachel was introduced to trish. Trish was into a very different lifestyle than I was, partying nonstop, getting likes on social media, living large. She was also into a lot of petty crime. Stealing from stores, workplaces, returning items for cash that she stole, empty envelopes into the atm, other small things that don’t make her a fugitive on America’s most wanted, but they don’t make her a very good person either. 


I got along with trish to save face, but never really liked her. And then, trish stole from me. She stole 300$ cold hard cash in a situation where all signs pointed to her being the only positive culprit, not even considering her history. The only possible thing that would’ve happened, was her taking it out of my wallet. 



Now, Rachel didn’t believe me when I asked her about my missing money and I asked if it could’ve been trish. I asked Rachel if she’d ask trish, and she did, but of course trish denied. Anyways, yadda yadda fast forward; Rachel has Trishs back and won’t let up and decides that trish is more worthy of her friendship than I.



Fine, we part ways. 




Fast forward again, maybe 6 months. Rachel reaches out, we mend fences. She’s still friends with trish, I do my best to swallow it. She’s also been talking to this guy for a while (jack) and he’s friends with trish and trish also has a dude (John) who’s friends with other dude and it all seems.... convenient. 




I do some research about jack and John and things aren’t adding up. Jack tells a lot of really crazy stories about traveling the world, going to Europe for just a weekend trip, but somehow doesn’t have a reachable cell phone number. Jack makes a lot of plans to meet with Rachel but they always somehow fall through; and for absolutely ludicrous reasons. “I saw you from across the room but I tripped and split my skull open and I’ll be fine but I had to leave.” Hmm ya, ok Jack. 



Rachel fucking believes it all. I show Rachel all these red flags, Rachel sees no flags in this very picture perfect classic catfish tale, and continues her romance. Trish continues her communication with both jack and John and a few other suspecting profiles on Facebook. 




So reverse google image search finally finds that jack and John are not who they say they are. The pictures jack has been sending Rachel, as well as the pictures of John, are actually Swedish TV stars who are friends IRL and living it up in Sweden. I finally have hard evidence to prove to Rachel that this is a catfish and something in my gut tells me its actually trish. 




Well folks, shockingly (not shockingly) it was trish. She was behind jack and John and about 6 other profiles communicating with Rachel. It’s super fucked up. Trish was Rachel’s internet love interest for the better part of a year. I think it’s pretty sick, Rachel doesn’t love it either and decides to cut ties with trish. I breathe a sigh of relief, this crazy woman is gone, I can have my friend back, life is good. 




A few other catfishes pop up after they’re split and they’re all trish, once again. Rachel doesn’t bat an eye, I still can’t believe how psycho obsessed Trish is with Rachel, but it’s all harmless enough I guess. But fast forward I think maybe 2 years, trish finally reaches out as herself and asks Rachel to meet up and begs for forgiveness. Rachel’s a good person and she does it. 



Things go fine, maybe even great! Because they start being friends again. More time passes and Rachel talks very poorly of Trish to me, maybe because it appeases me, maybe because trish is a piece of shit, who knows. Some more time passes, they don’t really spend a lot of time together, it doesn’t particularly bother me, life’s great. I move cities, a somewhat long distance away. 



Fast forward some more time and Rachel is single from her long term boyfriend. Rachel’s looking to get a little wild. In steps trish once again. They’re hanging out nonstop, living it up. Trish has even introduced Rachel to a real boy (Todd) who’s the apple of Rachel’s eye now. They’re all inseparable. 



Here comes the dilemma. I am in a different city than them both and it boils my blood to the point of explosion to hear anything about Trish or Todd. I don’t know how to be friends with Rachel when all she talks about is Trish when I know the things Trish has done to not only her, but me, her family and many other unsuspecting people. Obviously Rachel is over it, why can’t I be? 




How can I be Rachel’s friend and support her in her budding relationship with Todd and just sit there and hear her talk about how fun and amazing Trish is? How is it that Trish and I are on the same friendship level to Rachel?

How do I get the fuck over myself???

t3_chlm1v,"F18, friends disapprove of recent decision.","Hi! I’m 18, and my boyfriend, M, is 20. We’ve been together for six years this past April, started dating when we were 12 and 14. 

I moved out when I was 16 and he moved out at 18 that same year but we both moved into separate flats as we agreed it would be good to be properly independent and such, instead of moving straight from parents homes into OUR home. 
It’s been two years living alone and we’ve found a flat we love, close to both of our schools and jobs. We’re very excited to move in together!

However, some of MY friends think that it’s too soon and that we’re wasting “our precious youth” on being in a long term relationship this young and moving into together “so soon”. They’ve said numerous other things but I’ll keep it short. 

My question is, does it seem too soon? I know it’s our decision, but I’d like to see how someone outside of the relationship views it.

QUICK EDIT: Obviously, at the start of our relationship, it was a childlike and not mature relationship and it matured and developed as we grew up. I moved out at 16 because of issues at home.",relationship_advice
t3_chomv4,My girlfriend is so terribly rude to me when she goes out drinking. What should I do?,"My girlfriend (23F) is really rude to me (24M)  when she gets drunk. It honestly feels like I’m dating a 16 year old. Last night was by far the worst. We are preparing to move across country next week so there is a lot to get done to pack up all of our stuff. Her team at work has just completed a large project and an event was organized to celebrate (concerning to me as every time her work group goes to celebrate I see the same behaviour from her). So as to no surprise this time around, as I spend the entire evening packing up our kitchen, she was out getting absolutely wasted. At around 10pm I hadn’t heard from her in 3 hours. I decided to go for a 20 min run and let her know via text and that I wouldn’t be bringing my phone. I come back from my run to see a bunch of angry messages from her saying “how could you not bring your phone while I’m out drinking?” and that she wanted me to come pick her up.

So I try to call and text her to see where she is so I can come get her but she is totally ignoring my calls/texts. It’s about 10:30 now and I’m feeling exhausted and just want to go to bed, we have to work in the morning and still have a lot to prepare for our move. Over the course of a few hours I wait and continue to do some packing, occasionally trying to call her text her and all I get is some hang ups on the phone. She did answer it once to tell me she was going to a different bar down the street (at midnight) and when I told her it was time to come home she just said she had to go and hung up on me. I could clearly tell she was very drunk.

So I have no idea where she actually is and she stops answering any of my calls/texts. So I go to bed. 2am rolls around and she calls me for a ride. I go pick her up and as she usually is, she’s so rude to me. In my mind I’m understandably frustrated with how the night has gone but she’s so drunk and repeatedly calls me a selfish a\*\*h\*\*\*. She starts telling me my job is a joke and keeps going on and on about how great her work group is, how she got offered a job from a drunk old rich guy who is one of their clients, etc. She refuses to go in the house when we get home because apparently I’m still being an a\*\*h\*\*\*. She eventually passes out in the car, I try to carry her into the house but she wakes up and starts freaking out on me saying I’m hurting her.

We finally get into the house and all she has to say as she walks by the numerous boxes that I’ve packed that evening is “looks like you did f\*\*\* all tonight, literally.” At this point I just can’t believe what’s going on and I start crying and all she says to me is that I’m a f\*\*\*ing joke before she passes out in bed.

This is not the first time that this behavior has happened. It happens every time she goes out drinking without me. And she always gets super drunk. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to say I don’t want my girlfriend to go out and have a good time, her team really did deserve to celebrate after completing the project, but I just can’t take the way she treats me when I pick her up. Not only does she not appreciate at all that I came to pick her up at 2am and spent my whole evening packing while she was drinking, she’s just so rude to me. And we’ve talked about it before but she always plays it off like it’s not a big deal and that she’s sorry and was just drunk. I’m just so broken, I feel like she’s just a totally different person in these situations and it’s hard for me to believe she’s my girlfriend. I don’t know what to do. I know she never acts or says these things sober, but I don't even understand where these thoughts come from when she's drunk.",relationship_advice
t3_chfsxx,[RANT] My (20F) boyfriend’s (24M) baby-mama (22F) FUCKING SUCKS.,"I can’t even put into WORDS how much I HATE her. 

It’s not even a jealousy thing (she seems to think it is), it’s literally her lazy and atrocious “parenting” that makes me hate her. 

Before she got pregnant, she was addicted to heroin and cheating on (let’s call him Zac) and fucking tons of dudes behind his back, while being totally abusive and controlling to him (he told me she’s hit him before).  After having the child, she was in and out of rehab multiple times. She was about to sign him over but her mom talked her out of it. My boyfriend even drove to her rehab to have her sign the papers. 

When I first started seeing Zac, she only took their son a few times every few months, and showed absolutely no interest whatsoever in being a mom unless it was for a facebook post or snapchat.  She had a new boyfriend and all she cared about was him and HIS daughter.  She told Zac she couldn’t get off heroin for him, her parents, or her fucking toddler son, but this new boyfriend was the only person who made her want to get off heroin. (WHO SAYS THAT) 

She takes weeks to pay him for their sons school. (it’s literally $65/mo) and tries to claim him on tax forms while contributing literally nothing, no money and barely any care. 

It took 4 years for her to get her own car seat for him, and only did because my boyfriend took his to work with him instead of leaving it for her to use. 

She started seeing him more often (thursday-sunday) pretty regularly, but this week she took him wednesday night-friday afternoon and on sunday for a few hours. She put off coming to pick him up because she was “really busy” and came to pick him up with her boyfriends daughter and dropped him off as soon as possible, again, with his daughter.  He comes back and says he’s bored at mamas house which is heartbreaking because he’s sooo easy to entertain, as long as you pay attention to him and participate he has a blast.  

on top of this, she’s put him in pull ups (he’s potty trained) because she ‘doesn’t want to wash underwear every week’ and has told him to back talk his father. 

she’s lazy, doesn’t have a job, and cares more about her boyfriends daughter than her own son. 

all of this and she also sometimes flirts with my boyfriend saying she ‘misses their little family’ and she wishes things were different and sending him song lyrics about heartbreak and missing your ex. 

It breaks my heart because i love that kid like he’s my own.  He’s the sweetest kid ever. If music is on for a second he starts dancing, he makes up his own songs to sing. Sometimes I wish I would’ve met him years ago so it could’ve been me instead, so the kid could have both parents actually give a shit and put in effort. I play with him, take him for walks / treats / activities, a ton of his drawings are on my wall, we draw together, i watch him when everyone’s busy.  We both actively help him learn to read and write. I’ve taken him to the store and let him pick out a toy, my mom gives him gifts for christmas (she lives across the country and sends him cards and presents in the mail) 

He won’t take her to court because money/he doesn’t want to put his kid through that because he’s really young   it’s a lot of us being the better person and taking the high road. I just needed to vent because I don’t like talking about it to him because of course he gets upset and stressed. 

TLDR: my boyfriends baby mother is a deadbeat and i love their son to pieces and wish she would just admit that she doesn’t care and fucking leave us all alone.

t3_chok6i,How to deal with my colleague who stays flirty after being rejected,"Hello everyone,

So there's this guy (30-ish M) at my (24M) company who began on the same day as me. He was immediately being flirty but as I struggle to firmly reject people and as he just arrived in the country knowing absolutely no one, I basically laughed it off every time it became too obvious.

Fast forward to the company party in winter : I take all my courage and told him I sensed he was attracted to me and I was straight so that's a no. As awkward as I can be, I went on with telling him I still thought he was nice as a person and we could have a drink (at the company party we were attending). Mistake or not ? I honestly don't know.

With time flying, it became less and less awkward. The message had been sent and seemed to be received. He's still new in the city so when he began to ask me what I was doing on weekends, I once told him about an event my association was organizing. He got there, got very drunk, and told to my face stuff like ""I know you're straight but I really wanna kiss right now haha"". Yup. Well, not gonna happen. Let's get back to the conversation we were having and laugh that shit off. A lot of friends who were there later told me about my ""weird friend who doesn't seems to understand the concept of personal space""(men and women).

So it became awkward again and it is since. Minor events like him texting me on the company chat like ""you told me you were straight, right ?"". Yes I did told you I was straight. He also use to kind of randomly demand hugs to say hi we see each other in the cafeteria or during breaks, which is kinda hard to avoid and that I tolerate as it is harmless to me. Rejecting someone like that in public in front of other colleagues would be so awkward I prefer taking it...

Lastly, this week he invited me to a meeting so I could explain to him my job, which he could take in account to be better at his own job. My job and his are not even closely related so it was clearly about finding an excuse to see me. I accepted the meeting at first as it is his usual harmless shit, but then I told my direct colleagues about that and they all told me that this is ridiculous and I shouldn’t accept this so called meeting which sounds more like a date. I figured it was time to get free of this shit and cancelled the meeting, saying I was busy, and sent him a message telling him that I didn't understand this sudden interest as our jobs are not related, advising him a similar team who may be related to his job to ask his questions.

So I played his game and answered him in a professional way, which actually meant ""stop trying to find excuses to see me, and if you're really interested in this kind of job, them over here are your guys.""

I'd like him to understand that no means no and staying flirty after he heard the first no isn't at all appropriate, and I don't feel good in this situation. 

Somehow I'm thinking that if he was a straight guy, and I was as straight girl, that would be labelled as clear harassment.",relationship_advice
t3_chkckz,I want to break up with my 18M financially irresponsible girlfriend 18F. Do you agree? How should I approach her with this?,"Background - we're both 18, in an american university, both as international students. I'm broke just like most college students but she comes from an affluent family.

And my GF is very irresponsible about money. She comes from a non-western country so perhaps it's a cultural difference, but she made like several K loan to her older friend right after we met, and because of that and her impulse spending, she is always in short of money. So naturally I have to cover up sometimes. When we pay for anything, normally we split unless it's a special occasion. But because we don't carry cash, one of us pays and we electronically transfer the money to another. When she pays, I return the money instantly, always within 2 hours. Normally at the spot. When I pay though, she would take days, and normally won't return me the money until I ask for it. This happens a lot when she want to impulse buy and doesnt have money so I pay for her. She never gives me back the money without me repeatedly asking.

Honestly, I hate asking people to give me back money. I always feel guilty when I ask. I think that normally, at least in the western world, or at least in my country, people tried to give back the money they borrowed from others ASAP, however big or small. But my GF is buying fashion goods or food before giving me back the money. She always seems to forget, but she does it so often that I don't believe that's the case. Like, she says, ""oh I'll send you later"" and forget about it. If it was just a few bucks or few tens then I wouldn't care so much but normally these money are like over hundred bucks or so.

The thing that I'm most pissed about is the fact that she could always ask her parents and get money but she asks me because she's embarrassed and don't want to argue with her parents. She can do that if she wanted, but I can't call my parents for a few hundred bucks. If I had more money than her, I would've happily loaned money and waited until she felt like returning it, or even given the money. But I don't.

I'm kind of had enough. Because I'm constantly loaning her few hundred bucks, although I work a lot while studying part time, I can't really buy small treats for myself like new shoes or clothes. When she returns the money to me, because she doesn;t have her own money most of the time and her mom's credit card is her only source, she gives it back to me by taking me out to eat or things like that. Often not in the form of pure money. These things really don't help because I'm trying to save as much as I can to pay off the debt but because I give her the money, although she returns it eventually in some way, I end up using more than if I hadn't rent her the money. 

I've kind of had enough and want to break up because she needs a more rich boyfriend or change her ways, and I can't continue to have her in my life giving me unnecessary stress over money problems. I'm pretty set towards breaking up, but does my reasoning sound sound? If so then how do you think I should break up? I've never initiated a break up.",relationship_advice

t3_chmwpd,I [F22] feel violated by my boyfriend [M25],"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Tldr at the bottom. 
Also please excuse me for any grammatical mistakes. 

I have been having some health problems lately, which results in strong uterine pains.
This has put on hold my sexual relationship with my boyfriend, which I'm sure has his own hard time facing it, having a higher libido than me.

Also, I think my sexual desires have decreased since these health problems started. I feel very guilty about it, because I love my boyfriend and my heart wants to have sex with him, just my mind and body refuse to.
I haven't talked him about it because I'm afraid he wouldn't understand. He hasn't faced hormone imbalance (that's what I think it is, and I had to stop medication for it, but I digress) and I think he has a hard time understanding that sometimes, I'm not in the mood for sex. That's also my fault, because being the weak person that I am, I never fully voiced my dissent. 

However, this thing of ""not understanding"" when I don't feel like having sex (even saying things like ""let me go please"" and ""stop"") has took a very scary turn the other day.

We were at the beach. He was very excited about having sex later, while I was less interested. Anyway, he keeps being touchy, which I don't really mind. Then he keeps saying that he wants to fuck. He wants to fuck right there and now. And I don't want to. It was CLEAR that I didn't want to.

So we get on the sand, and while we was ""cuddling"" me, he starts fingering me. On the fucking beach. I'm like: ""stop please, people could see us and I don't like that"". But he continues. By now am feeling terrible and I couldn't even move or talk. I was frozen. I repeat: ""please stop"". He doesn't stop. Then he says something I wouldn't like to repeat, but was along the line of asserting dominance on me.

He finally stops, and I'm feeling very uneasy. I tell him I felt violated, and I didn't like it. So I move away from him.

He proceeded to say that ""he was sorry, but it's normal he wants to have sex with his girlfriend"". I tried to tell him how much that upset me, but tears kept coming up and I couldn't talk properly, so I just put my sunglasses on and pretended to sleep while I cried. I felt terrible. I felt like an object.

Why he couldn't control himself? It really puzzles me how he says he wants to make me feel good and he loves me but he can't understand why I don't like being fingered on the beach while everyone may spot us.

I tried to brush all of this thoughts away, and went on with my day. We even had sex later. But I can't seem to keep off my mind what happened. I feel that I have the right to feel violated, but maybe I should have voiced my dissent better, louder, or I should have talked before. I don't know what to think.

I feel treated like an object, with no real reason to exist but to please him. And I don't like it.
It also doesn't end here: he later talked how much he'd like to have anal with me. Now keep in mind: I don't like it, and it hurts. He fucking bought a plug so ""I could stretch for him so I'd like that"". What the fuck? 

Sorry for the long post, I vented a lot but I needed to put everything out. Please bear with me and let me know what I should do. Should I talk to him about it? I'm scared to do so because he may think I don't love him, or that I'm being moody... I don't know.

TLDR: My bf fingered me on a beach full of people despite me being against it. I didn't voice my dissent enough, still I can't help but feel like shit.",relationship_advice

He put forth a lot more effort forth then i’m used to, and initiated some conversations early that implied he was looking for something serious.

We had 3 amazing dates, then when he asked about an ex of mine I basically told him about how I was a rebound unaware, and after four months of dating that man decided he was not ready for a real relationship and we had a messy uncomfortable break that left me in shambles. Because I didn’t have proper expectations of what was happening. It was good that it did not work out for several other reasons than that.

Then A goes on to tell me that he just got out of a relationship, and is not looking for relationship level commitment right now.

Which I was actually fine with, it was very early in dating and if that wasn’t where he was at it was okay.
I was more than willing to meet him where he was at, trying to make sure that he knew I was pressuring him, just that I liked him and would like to continue spending time with him for now.

I was glad that he had told me and felt like he could be honest with me, and he obviously did it in the pursuit of not wanting to hurt me.

He expressed interest in continuing to see me as well, so in my mind that meant going super slow, or just casually dating. No big deal right?

Well we had plans that weekend, and he ended up canceling with what sounded like a legitimate excuse, and immediately set something up in the next day. So I wasn’t worried.

Then when next day came, he canceled that date as well. And that excuse sounded more flaky, and he didn’t attempt to set anything up.

So I just told him no worries and to have a great night. Trying to put out a chill positive vibe for him.

That was 5 days ago. And I have not heard from him since.

So I’m just ...not sure what exactly happened. I’ve set up a couple dates with some other guys and I’m trying to stay busy to distract myself.

He didn’t unmatch with me or unfollow from me on social media, so I don’t know if that means he plans on hitting me up in the future?

I’m just so sad and feel like somethings been taken away that I didn’t even know I needed. I don’t know if I’ll find it again.
And I feel like we’ll really be missing something if don’t at least try.

I’m not sure if it’s worth trying to pursue him and ask him how he’s feeling about things, or if I should just continue to distract myself until I hopefully stop thinking about him.",relationship_advice
t3_chk4kv,I (20F) cut my narcissist/mentally ill mother off today 6 months before my wedding. Any support would help.,"I’m the eldest out of the 3 children- I have 2 younger sisters between 12-15. My mom never had a stable relationship with anyone, or any friends. She’s an “educated” and “upper class” Narc- so upon meeting her you’d just assume she’s this sweet 43 year old woman until her mask slips. If it wasn’t with my dad and their traumatizing fighting I was subjected to (which she basically forced him to marry her) it was with his sisters. If it is wasn’t with his sisters, it was with her mom. Her dad left long ago. Then, as we got older, it was always one of us.. **It was always someone.** I was molested throughout my childhood by a non-blood uncle, my father beat me for years (angry outbursts) as my mom sat and done nothing besides “well I told him to leave” and numerous other emotional wounds from her. I have since repaired through therapy the relationship with my father. She was never hit.

At 18 I thankfully scored a full scholarship, a kick ass job as a legal assistant with salary, hit the road- and didn’t look back. I kept in contact these past several years and my sisters have communicated she will never change.

Several days ago she got into (yet another) explosive fight with her mother and called me. She said if I don’t stop talking to my elderly grandmother (who’s done everything for my mom) that she will not be attending my wedding and how dare I talk to someone so hurtful to her as her daughter. She even went as far to say she’s going to lie to my father my husband beats me so he doesn’t fund our wedding. She lied to my younger sisters I said all these things I never did- under the impression I “didn’t side with her” by remaining neutral and they both now hate me and have blocked me. That was my last straw.

Today I changed my number, texted my mother to go fuck herself, enjoy her life, and she lost a good child now. Her response was “adios”. I was always her backbone, always the “best and warmest one” to her. This is going to be tough but I know I need to do this. I have my partner (28M) I been with for almost 3 years by my side and his family. This honestly feels worse than a death, at least there’s closure in that.",relationship_advice

t3_chmngp,A closeted gay friend (19M) confessed to my straight friend (19M) and now he’s confused about his sexuality because he’s open to dating him,"My straight friend doesn’t use Reddit so I got his permission to post here since he really wanted to see what y’all have to say. TL;DR at the bottom. 

So my straight male friend (short for SM) and his closeted gay friend (short for GM) both grew up in traditional Korean families where homosexuality was looked down upon. But then SM left Korea for America when he was 13, while GM was stuck in a traditional society and couldn’t come out of the closet. SM was exposed to the various sexual orientations while he was in America and became a lot more open- minded and accepting than his parents. They lost touch when SM went to America but then reconnected about 1.5 years ago and became really really good friends. Up until two day ago, SM had no clue that GM was gay. That was until GM confessed to him that he thought of SM more than just a friend. SM had always thought that he was straight (he’s dated girls before), but GM’s confession had made him question himself as to whether he was bi/gay because he was open to the idea of starting a relationship with GM. 

SM is now curious and is into trying to start  a relationship with GM, but he doesn’t want to take advantage of GM’s feelings if things don’t work out. SM is also going back to the US for uni and GM is staying in Korea so they’d be doing long distance. If SM were to reject GM, he knows he’d feel really guilty because they’ve pretty much been inseparable ever since SM came back to Korea and SM doesn’t want to loose a dear friend due to awkwardness. What do you guys think he should do? Is it just his teenage hormones acting up? Is it selfish of him for wanting to try it out knowing it might hurt GM?

TL;DR Closeted gay friend asked my oblivious straight male friend out, and straight friend is now questioning his sexuality as he’s open to starting a relationship with him, but then he doesn’t want to hurt him if it doesn’t work out and they have a fallout.",relationship_advice
t3_chkdm0,I (21 F) am not sure if I want to break up with my boyfriend (24 M) or not,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over three months, but we've known each other and been friends for three years since we met through a college club. On paper, he ticks about every single box I've ever had for my ""perfect man"" and we got along great when we were just friends. Recently, right before the most recent spring semester ended, he asked me to dinner and I had an amazing time. A few dates later, he asked me to be his girlfriend to which I gladly accepted. 

As I live in a different state than the college we both attend, I went home for the summer to help take care of my family's business, while he did not want a job over the summer break. In the beginning, everything seemed good and I don't remember many issues. Later, its been the same few issues popping up over and over with him claiming he's going to fix his behavior, it gets better for a bit, and then it goes right back to what it was before. 

We text almost constantly and call every few days as my work schedule allows. He normally asks about my day and then conversation devolves into one of three topics: his roommates and whatever they're doing, video games, or him asking me to do / not do something. He always gives small, concise responses to whatever I send even though I've mentioned it bothering me. Also, as he very much enjoys video games, he goes through random periods where he won't text or respond for hours because he gets too caught up in playing them with his friends. I expressed that this makes me worry something happened to him or me making a mistake, and he claims that he just forgot. I've been putting more hours into work as of late and as a result, am busy more often and more tired once I get home.  It's frustrating because he knows my work schedule (I send it to him once I get it) and yet he still forgets about his phone for hours on end to play more video games that he's been playing all day. 

It also feels like I've been putting more effort into conversations. I can send a text asking a question or his opinion or advice, and I get answers that are ten words or less. I also let him know that this bothers me because it feels like he isn't paying attention, to which he says he'll try more, but it ends up reverting before the end of the day. Whenever we call or FaceTime, I'm always very happy to talk to him and I actually feel happy and more confident in the relationship than I did at any other time. He has a very annoying habit of playing video games or being on social media when we talk, which I've asked him to stop, but it just keeps going back. 

He accidentally said ""I love you"" at the end of a call recently and I was faced with the reality that I'm really unsure if I can return the feelings or not. I've been confused lately as to whether or not I still like him and have been considering breaking up or at least doing our own thing temporarily over the summer until we can be closer together geographically again. I know if I break up with him it would absolutely destroy his emotions and that's what I would feel worst about, I hate making people unhappy. 

So my questions are should I break up with him or take a break even though he's most of the things I've ever wanted? Is it okay to feel ignored and like he isn't listening to me because of his behavior never really changing? Should I try and hang on until the summer ends (6 weeks) and just try and rekindle it then?",relationship_advice

t3_chmli8,How to build trust,"So I met this girl on Tinder 6 months ago and we started going out casually. At first things were not serious and we both were kind of seeing other people at the same time. After about a month I started being serious and committed to her and stopped seeing other people. Meanwhile she kept calling me her kinda boyfriend. 

The thing was, we knew she was moving back to Japan in a few months so we tried to stay casual, but eventually we both became quite serious. We had a discussion and we both said we were not having sex with other people. Things were great. We both had our own social life and an amazing relationship. 

Fast forward 3 more months, she moves back to Japan. Now we're long distance but we both love each other. I decided to look at Google photos and our memories and found out she had left hers signed in on my computer, and what I saw made me sick. 

A video of her best guy friend here at the end of the night with just them two drinking. As he's waiting for a cab, I can hear a kissing sound off the camera. Already pissed off, I scroll more down and find videos of them in his bedroom from a couple months ago, well after we agreed not to date other people.

I would normally just leave her right away, but what we had was very good and I love the girl. I really don't know what to do. Is there anyway I could trust her again? Or is this doomed?

Thanks in advance, just need someone to talk to.",relationship_advice
t3_chkbx3,"Jealous without a good reason, don’t know what to do :(","Me (M23) and my girlfriend (F22) are just recently in an official relationship. We promised from the start that we would be very open/honest in communication with each other. 

So when we were still dating she told me about a good guy friend of hers. She told me about how he was in a relationship with this girl for 6 years, but they broke up. After the break up he had a lot of contact with my girlfriend (we were dating at that time), and even confessed that he was in love with her (my gf). He had really strong feelings for my gf, but she didn’t feel the same at all and told him that she was dating me. He accepted the situation, and they remained good friends. They still have contact with eachother, and they occasionally hangout.

And even tho she told me several times that she doesn’t have any type of feelings for him, and that there is nothing going on between them .. I still feel very jealous. To the point that when I see a notification of him on her phone, I really get into my feelings and it ruins my good mood. 

It really kills my vibe, and I can’t get it out of my head. Even when I’m not with her I think about him and her all the time. I know it’s not healthy but I don’t know what to do :( . It’s not that I don’t trust her, because generally speaking I’m not that jealous. But this situation in particular is really killing me mentally.

Also because I know that I don’t have any reason to be jealous.. she never gave me a red flag of unloyalty and she even says that I can read the text convo’s if I want. But every little thing makes me suspicious, and always at the end it shows that there was no reason for me to be so distrusting. And I don’t want to be that controlling guy and tell her that she can’t have any contact with him, especially when there is no good reason for it. 

I don’t want this to consume my mind anymore, and I also want to stop being so distant to her when I think about him, because she doesn’t do anything wrong.",relationship_advice
t3_chlr92,Not sure if in an abusive relationship,"So a bit of background I have been dating my boyfriend for 4 years.  I've studied donestic violence so I really should know better, but I really can't tell in this case. 

For the most part things are fine, we happily spend time together and share common interests.  He actually recently splurged on me for my birthday.  But the problem is the little things. 

For example, he is incapable of apologising to me if we have a fight.  When I say that he has upset me, the best I get is 'I'm sorry you feel that way'.  He also will not accept any responsibility for wrongdoing.  When I point it out he shuts down and will ask to not talk for a few days.  When I call him out on my feeling that I cannot share my issues with him, he won't talk about it and will sleep on the couch, as if to prove my point.  the last time I raised this he said it was because I had spent all day in the house and was obviously depressed.

I'm currently sick at the moment and he has said that I need to cook dinner for myself and made remarks when he thought I had left dishes for him to do.  If he's sick I wait on him hand and foot. 

He will bang on about how he loves me more, but won't sit down and talk to me.  I have caught him not listening to a word I have said on multiple occasions but he calls me a liar when I say that I had in fact told him something.  He's so worked up about that he know often 'file notes' our arguments. 

He's an incredibly smart man but I sometimes feel as though he holds that over me, despite the fact we have the same degrees and jobs.  He's also a golden child in his parents eyes, so I feel a lot of this may come down to how he has been raised. 

The thing also is, he doesn't exactly take no for an answer.  I mean, he will just grab me then expect sex or after he finishes once he expects me to keep going.  Because I've just had an injury I am often not in the mood and instead of respecting that he will touch hinself in front of me and even follow me around the house continuing to touch hinself, begging me to touch him, until I say yes.  I have broken down crying before because I don't feel respected, which is met with the 'I'm sorry you feel that way'. 

He also does not believe my injury is severe as it is and will sigh loudly when I say I can't do something. 

Despite all of the above, he can be very selfless and thoughtful.  We are often in a very happy place but when any of the above happen it makes me doubt my whole relationship.

t3_chnry0,Wife’s bad habits are ruining our relationship,"My [30/m] wife [25/f] and I have different standards for cleanliness. It’s something I can compromise with as long as she is willing to meet me halfway which  she isn’t. I am constantly cleaning after her along with normal household chores. I have to beg her to clean the kitchen and bathroom. Not only are our shared spaces a disaster, but even her stuff is gross. Her closet is messy and unorganized along with her vanity that has all of her makeup stuff. It drives me insane as I’m one of those people that needs to have a relatively clean home in order to relax. She won’t stick to any promises or agreements on cleaning schedules albeit I have never made an official, printed out schedule. It’s like pulling teeth to get her to clean because she always says she’s tired. She has a stressful job as an elementary school teacher, but I’m in school full time for the same thing and internships, PT job, and other commitments. Her only thing outside of work is playing on her phone and watching YouTube videos.  

To top all of this off, she has awful personal hygiene. She DOES brush her teeth everyday, thank god, but she doesn’t showers regularly. For example, her last shower was last Friday. On Saturday we attended an outdoor birthday party in which we sprayed ourselves with bug spray and sweated all day and night. I have tried hinting at her and being direct and telling her she smells and/or her hair is greasy. She just gets defensive and mad. Now I’m not one of those “you have to shower everyday” people. I myself only shower every other day because it’s not good for your skin and hair to wash everyday, but once a week? That’s too far.

This affecting everything! I never want to have sex because she smells. I don’t even want to sleep in the same bed. As for the cleaning, I feel like a maid or a parent cleaning after her or nagging her to clean. 

Help! What do I do that ISN’T leaving her? I know that’s an option but I feel there are many other steps before that. 

Also important to note that we are seeing a couples therapist and that thus far, it hasn’t affected her hygiene and cleaning.",relationship_advice
t3_chqoga,My wife (26F) got pockmarked acne that's ravaged her skin,"I am a 34M with a good job with everything going for me other than a happy marriage. We have a beautiful 1 year old son together and have been married for 5 years. Six months after our wedding, my wife got terrible pockmarked acne all over her face that took a long time to go away. Initially she didn't take care of it right away and that bothered me. She would get hysterical as soon as I would mention it. Our marriage pretty much went downhill from there. Now almost 5 years later, the acne is gone but her entire face is pockmarked with ice pick and rolling acne scars. Based on my constant nagging and bickering, she started seeing a dermatologist a year ago who recommended profractal laser treatment to treat the scars. She has gotten 4 treatments so far, and while there has been some improvement in the scarring, without makeup it just looks really terrible.

So we meet through a common friend and started getting close very fast. We have many things in common and we’re having great time together. Its been 3 months. I really liked her and thought that she was into me. However, when I said I really liked her, she said that she don’t want a relation because she likes freedom. Then, she also said that she don’t want to risk our friendship because she believe that every relation in these ages going to be over.

I never felt so close to someone else before. So, I said that we can continue being friends but my feelings will not change.

Yesterday, I learned from one of my friends that she was in holiday for a week with her ex. I knew that she was in holiday but she said that she will visit his friend and travel around. I heard that they broke up 8 months ago and they had been together for 4 years before that. She never mentioned about that either.

I am mostly here because this is a person who was in my life for 5 years, and I felt like I knew everything about him. And in a lot of ways I still do feel like I know him, but this is behavior that I never could have seen coming, but it does kind of make sense knowing his resistance to dealing with his emotional traumas. My biggest fear in relationships has always been a fear of being manipulated, and that is exactly what happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is how do I, moving forward, feel comfortable with future SO's and feel like I actually do know them? Is there ever a way to truly feel like you know someone, and know that they wouldn't cheat on you? I feel like I want to make sure that I have an SO who seems incredibly aware of their mental traumas and actively works to taking care of their mental health, and I feel like that is a good predictor for if I will be able to know who they really are.

I let people in so easily, and from day one, you know exactly where I am at. I just want to find something like that, but it scares me that someone could be putting on a face even if they were acting that way.

So I have a crush on a girl in my class (I'm in high school). So after 2 months of crushing on her, I gathered up my courage and decide to confess to her. She's really cute and innocent and not the type to have boyfriends (I live in a country where having premarital relationships are generally frowned upon). I was sure that she would not accept me (Again, she ain't that type). So I went and told her I liked her. She obviously didn't accept (She didn't explicitly say that she liked me but didn't hint the other way either. Anyways there was some chemistry between us.)She said that she's focusing on her studies and her ambition (which I really respect and found to be attractive). She was really nice. And we parted as friends. This was yesterday.

But today things got awkward. I mean really awkward. She seemed to avoid me. We have mutual friends and have group convos. We eat lunch in the same hall. She's in all my classes. She didn't seem to notice I was there(trust me people she noticed). And I sort of understand that but still she said that we could still be friends. So I went and asked her why she was avoiding me. She said that she wasn't avoiding me and I was avoiding her. I was never (maybe slightly) avoiding her though. I need some advice on this situation. I can't even talk to her without blushing deep red (she does the same thing). It's still really awkward.

Over time I (24M) have found an interest in her and am unsure of what signs to look for if its mutual.

Things were pretty stagnant until a couple days ago when we carpooled to a company event together. We were in the car together for almost two hours laughing the entire time, getting to know each other.

When we got there she asked a seemingly suspicious question (if I added her on snapchat because someone with the same first name did and I'm the only one she knows with this name) but I didnt and told her so.. I asked her what her handle was and added her later that night so if that's what her intentions were then it worked. This was one of a few moments where I wondered what sort of interest she has in me.

On the car ride home (and there too) she asked many questions about my old boss (her current boss) and became extremely interested when I started talking about his marriage. The first question she asked within a split second of bringing it up was ""Is she hot?"". So at this point I'm beginning to think she has a thing for her boss. She mentioned how some guy at a conference this summer asked her for her number and asked her out, which she told her boss about. Without projecting too much I cant tell if this is a further indication that shes in to her boss or if she was trying to momentarily make me jealous.

Any one have thoughts of the queues she might be sending me? Should I bother asking her out once her internship is over or should I just assume shes being friendly? Not trying to make a fool of myself..

t3_chqk7r,I (20M) realized how much I miss an old friend (19F) and I don't know what to do,"1. My friend introduced me to a girl he was friends with back in 2017 when we had just finished our final exams in school. We were gonna be hanging out in my house afterward; he had been talking about her recently and I thought he might like her, so I told him to bring her too and she turned out to be pretty cool. Long-story short, he told me told me he had no interest in her after I said they sounded like an old-married couple.
2. She and I started talking, became good friends and a few months later I asked her if she wanted to come to my grads (this is similar to prom, but is more of a graduation celebration) as friends and she kind of avoided the question at first and said she needed time to think. A few days later, without prompt, she said she wanted to go. About 3 weeks before it, she cancelled on me without reason, and I'll admit I was a bit upset and half-ignored her for a while after that, but I got over it. I was kind of confused at this point in regard to how I felt about her.
3. A few months later, she invited me to a ball of sorts. It was really just another formal event except I'd be surrounded by people 3 times older than me. She was relentless, in a good way, in trying to get me to go. I figured I could just stick by her and my friend all night because he'd be there too and that's exactly what I did. When I was there, I was so hung up on  figuring out how I felt about her that I barely said a word to anyone and on top of that the food and drink were so bad that my friend and I were starting to feel under the weather. She had repeatedly been asked to dance by multiple people but kept refusing and I got the message that she was waiting for me to ask her, but I didn't.
4. My friend's mom came to pick us up because I was gonna be sleeping at his for the night, and as I was leaving I heard that she cut her leg pretty badly. I wanted to go to her and make sure she was alright, but I felt bad for my friend already because I felt like I had ruined his night and I didn't want to keep his mom waiting...so I left without saying goodbye. That's the stupidest thing I could've done.
5. After that night I figured she probably really liked me and I knew I screwed up and she probably didn't like me anymore, so I didn't even bother trying to fix things. It was at this point I knew I wanted to be with her. We drifted apart after being good friends for just under a year, and I fooled myself into thinking I never liked her that much, even as a friend.
6. We haven't talked in over a year and I've changed so much since then; gained more confidence and have become much less introverted. I'm not sure whether to say it's fortunate or otherwise, but I had a dream recently where we reconnected and both came to the realization that we missed each other so much. Once I woke up I had this intense feeling that I missed her. I waited about a week to see if it was some freak thing and if the feelings would subside, but they haven't.

&amp;#x200B;

  
I'm not sure what I want beyond wanting to be in her life again, but regardless, I have absolutely no idea how to reconnect with her or where to even start.

t3_chlitf,"What to do after letting someone you thought you could trust into your home? Manipulative (Long story, I apologize in advance)","At a loss for words... This is going to be a long winded story, yet summed up best I can because this has been going on for a year now.

I made a huge mistake. Let someone that I thought was family into my home, and now I’m paying the price. I allowed her to move in with me and my grandmother. I first met her in a student club where high schoolers were able to help out and develop relationships with special needs kids and their teachers. She was an aide. We became friends very quickly, connected on all aspects in life. I viewed her as a mentor and someone that could really help me and vice versa. I made a fetal error of thinking I knew someone, &amp; inviting her into my home. She has a son who is very young that she uses for sympathy of others and is completely innocent in his mother’s actions. (if you saw how they made their rounds to loved ones and friends on holidays you’d understand) I am at a complete loss as to what to do. At the age of 17, I was struggling to keep a steady job due to harassment in the work place (Have high functioning autism) and she was able to take advantage of my family’s disfunction to basically secure her a place in the house. This woman convinced my grandmother that I wasn’t an asset to the house, and that I was ungrateful, etc. I was truly too depressed to even leave my room and I was also faulted for that. In my mind, I didn’t want to bring depressive energy around my grandma. Now, she has two of her friends moving into the house. I’ve long moved out by now. I couldn’t take the constant ridicule and criticism as Ive been trying to figure out what I wanted in life and have been finding myself. To give a little backstory on my family and why this person was able to take advantage of the conflict- My grandma raised me. Mom was very caught up in her ever changing life and everyone had come to an agreement that living with my grandparents would be best. And it was. My grandpa got sick and became bedridden when I was very young. So my grandma was basically like a single parent. I knew nothing of my family’s past until the past few years and things I’ve found out have been heartbreaking, because ideally, all I’ve ever wanted is for us all to be together but I understand that will never be the case. My grandma and mother aren’t close due things they’ve happened in the past- I.e. my grandma cheating on my grandfather and tearing the family apart because of it, she is also a pathological liar. because my grandfather had to go through such great lengths of bailing her out of prison due to her work scandals, my mother is scarred. I have taken in everyone’s perspectives and tried to see a clear picture of things and it is tearing me up. 


I remember this woman telling me in the past that she was jealous of my life but I was so disassociated from reality and in survival mode that I wasn’t able to protect myself. I didn’t think she would go through such great lengths to pretend to care for me as a person just to essentially “take” my spot. Well I’ve given up. I moved out a month ago away from the toxicity. I have tried being a part of their lives but feel as if I no longer fit into a place I used to call home. I was made to be very dependent from a young age and was torn apart when I couldn’t be self sufficient and when it became inconvenient for my grandma. Now my mother and I have reconnected after a long time, and she is helping me get my life together.

What has broken the straw for me, is the fact that my grandma, and her roommate, tried setting me up with one of her friends. My grandma kept calling me and telling me that I need to meet him and how him and I are so much alike and how I would love him. Well, I met him. &amp; I fell very fast. We spent hours connecting and talking about life. Made art together. What I didn’t know, was that he had a thing for my roommate since day one even though she’s in a relationship, she is playing both sides. I’m so embarrassed that I admit my feelings to this person only to find out they had been a discreet thing all along. I can’t help but feel like it was all a set up and intentional. Him and I meeting was almost forced instead of happening natural. They made it extremely awkward.. if I wasn’t so young and inexperienced, things would be different. If I had my life together more, I never would have allowed someone to take so much advantage. 

At the end of the day, my mother and I both deeply worry about my grandma who is very sick and most likely not thinking very clearly, because she has invited a bunch of strangers into her house who are using her. Another example, when I was in between jobs, the woman I’m speaking of mentioned that my grandma was paying her for her foodstamps.. and expressed that was her way of contributing to the house. My grandma is currently trying to clear up another room for them to use, and I found out she has an ant infestation she is holding off on treating due to lack of funds— no one there has offered to help or pay for anything and they’re all staying for free. If I had a job, I would provide the money in a heartbeat. Circumstance is not in my favor but I’m going to have a degree later down the road and want to take care of my entire family when I can... I just don’t understand how people can be so hateful.

I have tried telling my grandma that this person doesn’t have our best interest and doesn’t seem to care, but she won’t hear me out. She has her own opinions and constantly tells me that I’m perceiving things wrong. I have been so open to try and understand other perspectives that I forgot about myself and that’s why I had to move in the first place. I have already typed so much and that is only a fraction of the story but I have shared what has hurt me the most. If anyone has any insight or advice on what to do, please PM me or leave a comment.

t3_chqk09,My (23F) mother (53F) is very controlling over me.,"Small context, my mom and I have a... very strained relationship. Shes always ragging on me for my weight and I am very self conscious of myself anyway. Thanks to her I have no faith in myself and have to wear baggy clothes to hide my body. I wear nerdy shirts based of video games and anime. Pretty much all I own besides my work uniform.

All while she keeps telling me I need to take pride in how I dress and look. She doesn't like it when I wear make up or wear dresses and skirts. 

Followed by how I can never go out and hang with my friends at night and literally all we do is hangout at someone's house and play board games and video games. Half the time my boyfriend can't go because of when he works. If its past a certain time at night, nope I can't go. Which has resulted on my group of friends not really inviting to much of anything anymore. 

And yes I am aware I'm an adult but I also like to show my mom some respect. Her house her rules. Also I work a dead end job with bills to pay so I'm trying to save money to move out, trust me. 

I have an older brother (27M) who got to leave the house whenever at night and come back whenever the next day. He has multiple girlfriends where my mom has known he was sexually active with and even recently got one pregnant. And even had a few girlfriends live with us. I cant even stay the night at my boyfriend's or have him stay the night at my place.

While I have awful periods, decided to put myself on the pills to help and she freaked out. Also I am sexually active but only one family member knows. My mom would kill me if she knew. She always says ""Sex is for marriage."" which I know good and well she and my dad had sex well before marriage since they're high school sweethearts.

But she has never approved of any of the guys I've dated and I've only dated barely 4 guys. And the guy I'm with now, I'm very much in love with and he's going to school to be an EMT. 

I'm just so tired of her controlling me... I have my grandmas I could stay at but my brother is living with her. He and I don't get along well for many other reasons. I'm kinda trapped till I can get to my goal for moving out.",relationship_advice

We were both people that carried baggage with us and are both in hard times in our lives, this made things tough sometimes but I had never gave up nor was it ever too much. I am someone that gives out a lot of love and would like to have it returned. At first that's what it was until a brief period I had slipped mentally and was down. It caused problems on which I admit were my fault because I needed to get help, but I found help and am on the way to recovering and being a better person but in that process she had lost faith for us, she feels hollow and doesn't want to commit to a relationship anymore... which breaks my heart after being dragged along for so long just to have things turn to a quick 180. Am I wrong for being mad at her? Especially when she tells me that she still loves me? I would do anything for the one I love, I would never give up on someone.

t3_chqjjk,Dating advice,"Hi reddit.
So I've been seeing this guy for a month roughly now and one night we both confessed that we have some sort of crush on each other but wanted things to be slow, which came from both sides since we have both been in toxic relationships before.

Hes a super honest and direct person.

A few days ago he's just been more distant. Also hes been online way more and I just started thinking ""ok he found someone better than me and I'm just not interesting enough anymore"". I never confronted him about it, because it seems kind of overreacting and I'm trying to get better at trusting people.
But I told my beat friend and she basically said that I should get down to earth because essentially we are just 2 people who have sex and hang out and that's it. 

I get what she meant because I am usually always like nobody owes anybody anything. And I mean he can do what he wants and I can do what I want essentially.
But somehow that still hurt me in some kind of way. We also talked about what if we wanna date other people and agreed that we should at least be honest about it and communicate but that theres nothing wrong with it.
Which it isnt and idk why but I'm just feeling so bad over this. 
I dont wanna take anybody's opportunity and I also dont wanna be like ""we need to label this now"" because hasn't played out well in the past and I also dont wanna label things.

Idk this is a lot of text now, sorry.

Basically I feel hurt even tho i got no reason at all and idk what to do, like my coping mechanisms are telling me to distance myself so IF he ends up falling for somebody else I won't be that hurt.
I do wanna keep talking to him but yeah my brain is telling me to shut down.

t3_chqidb,Advice on sexual rejection (21f),"Longtime lurker. I (f21) and bf (m30) have been together 1 year and are having a sexual compatibility problem. After a day together I understand we both want to chill, cuddle, chat and probably neither of us will be horny. Even without feeling horny I feel like I want to be close to my s.o and intimate. He thinks that sex takes away from the two of us just enjoying each others company. I think it is an expression of our love and it makes me feel close to him. He has been saying no also because he's tired on weekdays after working.

For the last few months it's been me trying it on with him and then being rejected. Being rejected multiple times just hurts. This week he said it's unfair for me to pressure him. I can understand he may feel disrespected as no should mean no - no further discussion. And I get that. But he's tired every weekday and 50/50 on the weekend. I feel we should make the time and effort to be intimate together. We've suggested doing it earlier in the evening. But at this point now I feel like I don't want to initiate anymore, after being rejected and feeling unattractive, I feel vulnerable and I refuse to push something he doesn't want. I think he won't come onto me so sex will decrease. 

After talking about it this week he sent me a text picture saying ""I say no sometimes, that doesn't mean I'm a bad person though it feels that way somehow and it doesn't mean I don't care"". This made me feel like I'm an aggressor and made me feel bad about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been close to my oldest cousin (34 F), she's babysat me when I was younger, I've confided in her as I grew up, she's taken me for vacations trips with her bf, etc etc.

When she got pregnant with ""niece"" (not directly niece since she isn't the daughter of a sibling, even thought I consider my cousin to be one), she was obviously nervous for being young, but I was mostly happy. We are currently living in the same city, about 600km away from our relatives.

I've taken care of my niece since I can remember, from diaper changes to just babysitting once we grew older. She's obviously always been close to me, and as I got my own apartment couple of years ago she usually comes by to stay every other weekend for a night or two, we go out to eat, to the movies, etc. 

So last friday evening, my cousin's bf dropped her off at my place (we had already agreed to, I like having her around), we just ordered some food and watched some movies, nothing out of the ordinary.

On saturday, took her shopping, I had to buy a pair of shoes for my job, and I bought her a sweater and a pair of jeans that she liked. We got home, I made lunch then we just went to my bedroom and started watching some netflix show (Stranger things, idk why I tell you that). She was laying on my chest while we were just idly talking/watching tv, then suddently she turned to face me properly, grabbed my head and just kissed me on the lips. I was stunned for a second, but then I just pulled back and got out of the bed. She started getting teary eyed and I basically just put some clothes on and left. Called my cousin to ask her to pick her up, giving some excuse about having to leave for work. 

&amp;#x200B;

t3_chqeee,How should I approach my girlfriend about contributing to monthly bills?,"As the title says, I'm wondering how to approach her on splitting bills. Currently I make roughly $37/h, and handle all bills for everything. My girlfriend (22 F), who got her first full time job, makes roughly $25/h, but also does PRN for a couple hours here and there where she makes anywhere from $30-40/hr. She has lived at my house for the past 6 months, for the most part she goes to her parents house for supper on sundays and stays there. I am under huge stress with bills.

She will get groceries and stuff for supper here and there, but I buy a 1/2 a cow and a 1/2 pig every 6 months, so we have a freezer full of meat, she's only buying small stuff. I've asked numerous times for her to give me $400 a month for stuff, and she just says she's not ready to do that etc etc. Now after searching reddit, I see the $400 a month I was originally asking for, when I'm paying roughly $2,000 a month for living expenses is very very generous.

I’ve been with my girlfriend almost a year now, overall it’s been amazing but recently we had some trouble because she suffers from depression which has caused her a few attempts at her own life and which sometimes causes stress, last Thursday we had a pretty bad argument big argument in the heat of the moment I ended it and we didn’t speak for 4 days. She came back and we talked about it and wanted to try and make a way forward from it I asked if anything happened and she said no I believed her. Today I got a message off a guy that at the start of our relationship kept trying to get fired in about her on one occasion kissing her which she denied and later confessed to, guy was someone she had hooked up with in her past but she told me it was nothing serious. The guy was bragging to me about how they slept together and did I want to pick up her things showing me a picture of a bracelet I had gave her. I confronted her and she admitted to it. She told me she was broken at the thought of loosing me that she thought it was done for good and she went to the first place she got attention because she needed a distraction. She insisted that she regretted it the next day and felt ashamed and knew she only wanted me. For a final kick in the balls is  I found out it she went to his the same night we split up. 

I think understandably I’m hurt and angry at the situation. I know I will be told I did end it so I can’t really hold it against her but to me the limited time she waited and the choice of person kinda shows to me a total lack of care and respect for me.  I really don’t know what to do part of me just wants to leave it and wash my hands of the entire situation but I do love this girl. My question is can I trust her after this?

t3_chqdo7,My [M23] girlfriend [F21] broke up with me over my dietary choices,"So this girl, let's call her Beatrice, and I had been dating for about two months now. I'll have to give you a little backstory, but she just abruptly ended our relationship yesterday.

Since I was a child, I've had admittedly a bit of an odd snack choice. I love eating spider webs. I tried a spider web when I was around 8 and I've been hooked since. As a kid, when I was playing outside and I found a spider web, I would put my hand on the web and roll it around to get all the web and spider on my hand and then I would eat it. I just love the flavor of the web and sometimes there's even bugs or a spider in the web, so you get those little bits of crunch to go along with the silky smooth web.  As I've gotten older, I'm outside around spider webs less, so what I do now is go somewhere like a crawl space where there's lots of spider webs and gather as much web as possible and put in a resealable Ziplock bag for future snacking.

Anyway, back to the present.  I was at Beatrice's apartment, we were about to go out to see Midsommar. She went into her room to change and I realized I had a hankering for a snack, but I didn't want to pay movie theater prices for candy or popcorn. I reached into my tote bag and pulled out my zip lock bag of spider webs. I reached in and starting chowing down, and then Beatrice came out of her room. She asked me what I was eating and I told her spider webs. She started laughing because she thought I was joking, but then she came closer and saw that I was actually eating spider webs. She gave me a look of disgust and started freaking out. She asked me to leave and tried to protest, but she started yelling and telling me to leave immediately.

I tried texting her when I got home, but she's not responding and she blocked me on all social media. What should I do?

Friend = Girls friend who I've known longer than Girl.

Someone = Person friend wanted to hook me up with.

Quick backstory:

We had met over instagram September 2018, she is married but separated, and she has kids. She separated due to domestic violence and abuse throughout their 8 year marriage. We got extremely close to eachother, initially as friends but grew into something more intimate. We said we loved eachother in May 2019, and grew closer past that. However, she's not healthy and she knows that. She knows she has alot of healing to go through. And she has made selfish decisions such as sleeping with someone else after we started talking, sexting another married man. Stuff like that, but I've understood because of where she's at right now mentally. Her current husband is going to trial for the domestic violence against her and will probably face jail time, atleast a year. And since she's a domestic abuse victim, she is still hanging on him. She is not attracted to him, and doesn't want him, but she is still attached. And she's agreed about how much pain, hurt and anxiety she's put me through by her uncertainty of everything. Such as her wanting me one day, but the next being completely distant.

So let's fast forward here...

3 weeks ago, I've wanted to sit down and talk to her about our situation, how she's feeling, where she wants to go with our relationship etc. because she had been distant and it's been a while since we've had a deep meaningful talk, and she had mentioned wanting to take a break, I had also gotten word that she was thinking of completely going back to her husband and not getting the divorce. She kept putting it off, promising me that she wanted to talk. But her husband was either around, she was too tired, had to take care of the kids etc etc. There was always an excuse, and I understood that. She's practically a single mom working full time, it's hard to make time. Well I would ask her about it alot, saying, ""Hey if you can make time this week for us to talk, I would really appreciate it"". And it never went anywhere. So last week, let's say the 15th, I started really cracking down because I had seen multiple times where we could have sat down and talked, but she chose not to. So on Wednesday, I told her that if we couldn't sit down and talk that I was done, we could be friends, but I couldn't go on allowing my self to get hurt. After that she sent me alot of texts explaining how she knows I deserve better, she knows that she can be an amazing woman for me but right now she's not healthy, she wants me to be happy etc etc. Well, we have a microbrewery taproom where I live, I frequent it, and I know the people who go there, such as her friend I mentioned in the title. I went on Thursday the 18th to play trivia to get my mind off of things and I was sitting at the table with her friend, the girl I'm talking to wasn't there. Her friend knows the struggle that this girl has put me through, and decides that she wants to hook me up with someone else who apparently was really into me. So to recap I had told the girl that I'm done, and her friend decided to hook me up with someone else. Well I added this someone else on snapchat later that night, and we started casually talking the next day, which would be Friday. Friday also happened to be the girl I'm talking to's Birthday. She decided she wanted to see me, so I went by her house and it was the perfect time to finally talk to her about everything, what we're doing, where we're going in a relationship etc. She got upset that I wanted to talk and said: I don't want to talk about this, if you want to talk go make other plans. So I did, I was upset yet again that she couldn't sit down and have an honest conversation with me, feeling rejected and empowering my decision earlier in the week that I was done with her. So I go to the taproom after I leave her house, her friend shows up and we all sit together with other people, and she decided to invite the someone who she wanted to hook me up with and that I've been talking to casually on snapchat.  I was there for an hour before this someone else shows up, and wouldn't you know it about 15mins later the Girl I'm talking to shows up. Girl ends up leaving, not knowing that Someone is there, she didn't even know who Someone was. Girl just saw me there, got upset that I had actually left her house after she told me to find something else to do, and I went to taproom. Girls sister started texting me begging me to spend the rest of the night with them for Girls birthday, I finally agreed, setting my own emotions aside so Girl can have a good night for her Birthday. I hang out with them the rest of the night Friday. Sunday rolls around, and I get the nerve again to ask her, one last time, if she wants to talk. And we get into an argument and I'm letting it all out on her, of how I feel rejected, hurt etc etc, and all I've been wanting to do is talk through everything with her about where we are, so we have a clear understanding. Finally she agrees to talk Monday night. Halfway through she asked if I was talking to anyone else, she had intuition that I was talking to someone, SO I admit to her that I met this someone on Thursday night and we've been talking casually. We had a great talk, very constructive, we worked things out, understood eachothers side of things, and it made me feel so much ease towards me and Girl. I stayed the night actually, that's how good the conversation was. So we fast forward to yesterday, Wednesday. I get a random text in the morning from Girl telling me I lied. Girls Friend had decided she was going to tell Girl that I was saying me and Girl didn't talk anymore, and that me and Girl were not a thing, that I had said bad things, and manipulated friend and that's why friend wanted to hook me up with someone. After Monday btw, I stopped talking to someone, I wasn't interested in her, not only because I still wanted Girl, but because I wasn't into someone. So now Girl thinks I'm lying about that, she thinks I purposefully left to go hang out with Someone, and now she thinks I told friend a very deep secret a long time ago that I didn't tell her. But she's believing friend over me. And At this point I'm trying to figure out what to do, what to say to her, how to prove my innocence to her. Is this a lost cause? Is she too broken and afraid that she wants to ruin what we could potentially have? I just need unbiased help, any help.",relationship_advice
t3_chqc2o,Girlfriend (F21) suddenly doesn’t feel the same,"I've been this girl for 6 months. She has high anxiety and has her moments mentally from time to time. I am currently on a family vacation with her right now, and suddenly she was giving me the cold shoulder. Nothing I said was funny, never sparking conversation, never being intimate, no sex. So asked her what was wrong and she told me a few things:

- She gets very upset when I make jokes around her that touch her sensitivities (e.g. weight jokes, weed jokes, etc)
- She says I never text her first
- She says I never show her off on social media or like taking pictures with her
- She says since school she has barely felt like she's had a boyfriend

She dumped all of this on me. I was caring and understanding. I apologized for the jokes I had offended her with and can do more of the other things she mentioned easily. But I also told her, I cannot have a girlfriend who isn't loving, affectionate and easy to talk to, like she was a mere few weeks ago! She also said that she doesn't know if she can have us go back to the way we were. We made up that night, she said she loved me, and that she would love to try to make this work.

But now, everything seems fake. Some affection but not like before, we were all over each other. I don't think it is fair that she thinks I was supposed to read her mind and figure out this stuff on my own! And these are such minor things. But we are still not hooking up (she is on her period). She called her mom last night and she told her that she's in the wrong and that her lack of communication caused this. I have been nothing but a strong and caring boyfriend to her. My lack of texting or posting her on social media is on the smallest side of the spectrum but it appears to be ruining everything. I understand its only been a few days since this talk, but how can she expect to have a long term relationship without understanding communication and the highs and lows ?!

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Best.

TL;DR: Girlfriend bottles up emotions, suddenly gives cold shoulder and tells me she doesn't feel we are the same because of minor things.",relationship_advice
t3_chldr3,Has porn made me into the ultimate cuck? I struggle to see myself as a sexual being...,"I (21M) grew up really sheltered and socially anxious. Add that to the fact that I was ugly up until age 19, I had a really hard time. Low self esteem, anxiety, depression...

I used porn as an escape. I was addicted. I used to wank upwards to 5 times in one day. It started ok then turned into fucked up fetishes. 

**I never saw sex as something that I could actually participate in. I just never considered it a possibility.**

*Me?* No way. This is how I thought. So I abused a lot of porn. It (sex) just seemed like something *other* people did but not me.

Eventually at age 19 I lost weight and looked good. However there was still a disconnect in getting attention from girls. Sex was something I only thought *other* people do, not me. I tried a few Nofap streaks but could only do several days at a time.

On my longest streak I went 3 weeks and then fucked a prostitute. But this felt like glorified porn. I was no longer a virgin but the experience didn't feel natural. How could it? I paid for sex. There was no mutual attraction or build up.

I always cock blocked myself when girls wanted to fuck me from nightclubs. The thought terrified me...but after fucking the prostitute I realized I had no performance issues. 

Now I'm on a 12 day Nofap streak. The problem is, I can talk to girls, socialise, etc but there seems to be a disconnect in believing that *I* could be the guy to have sex with them, even though these girls have shown interest in me. **I'm so used to watching other people live their lives, that I never really learned how to live my own.**

t3_chqafx,"Is it okay for being a little upset about my girl calling other guys ""cute""","I've only ever been in one serious relationship before this and that one was a pretty damn strict one, mutually. So it can be hard to adjust to a new one where the expectations are different; however, I feel like it's to be expected that my SO describing other men as cute generally isn't ""okay"". 

So the other day my girl texted me explaining a situation at work, and described the guy as ""cute"", when I replied, i ignored her situation and commented on how she had to use the word cute, she could've just said ""a guy came in at work"". I then told her (as were in a fairly new relationship) ""idc what guys you think are cute or not, just dont tell me about it"", 

She replied pretty dry and we didn't chat about it until we saw each other again.

t3_chqabs,Should I stay with him?,"Today I found out that my boyfriend kissed a female friend on a night out. To give context we've been going out for around 3 months but have been close friends for about a year. In all other aspects he has been a perfect boyfriend which is a welcome change from previous relationships. I've had kind of emotionally abusive and manipulative relationships that's he's aware of and has helped me gain confidence in being in a relationship again as I had not wanted to be in one ever again. He's been very supportive and understanding and has treated me better than anyone has ever done before.
Now to explain the kiss. He had just graduated uni and was absolutely wasted and he said a female friend kissed him at the end of a night out outside a takeaway. He said it lasted about a second and was just more than a peck. The girl is the type of girl who likes to kiss other girls bf and I feel like she kissed him because she wanted to see if she could. Which apparently she could. He apparently didn't say anything to her afterwards and when I asked him to message her to say that it was a mistake he said that it would be very awkward and that she probably doesn't remember doing it.
I really like this guy, more so than anyone I've ever been with but I have had very bad luck with guys mainly due to my own lack of strength and letting myself be badly treated. I don't want to throw away a potentially good relationship over a kiss that he didn't initiate and that lasted a second but I also don't want to be a push over. I've essentially been cheated on which has never happened before and really don't know what to do.
He's said sorry a lot and that it was just a very drunken mistake and that it won't happen again but I don't want to be the type of person that stays with someone once they've been cheated on. I don't know if it was a meaningless kiss or something worse and I feel like it's very early in the relationship for something like this to happen. I really need advice because I don't want to tell any of my friends about it because we have entirely mutual friends and I don't want them to think less of him or me for staying with him, but I need to talk to someone about it.

t3_chb9l5,I now have the clear memory of my boyfriend raping me,"I had a suppressed memory of my boyfriend raping me. I had blurry memories of it before but I wasn’t ever sure so I really didn’t know what I was thinking.

But last night I  (f, 23) was having sex with my boyfriend (m, 26) and all of a sudden it just came back to me all at once. I don’t want to give the gory details but 

It was like a flashback and a terrible feeling rushed over me like it was happening then.

I guess I reacted because my boyfriend kept saying my name and then he slapped me across the face and said “what’s wrong with you”

the slap kinda put me back in reality and I felt so weird and sick, I told him nothing and let him finish.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m going crazy or not. I’m also mad that my boyfriend slapped me but whatever I’m more hung up on the other thing. Do memories really suppress like this or am I delusional? I hate thinking of leaving my boyfriend but I want to know the truth and I might confront him",relationship_advice
t3_ch9msc,From 15-18 I was in a relationship with a person 10 years my senior. Was this abuse?,"I’m not really sure where else to post this. 

Long story short, I got involved with a man when I was 15. He would give me light but inappropriate touches and then a little before my 16th (age of consent here) it escalated to kissing and then eventually when I was 17, oral sex. 

Obviously, I think he’s seriously fucked up to have been involved with me. However, there were a few points I wanted to mention that lead to me being so unsure about..how I should view it, I guess. 

• I was very, very into it. I consistently fed into his feelings and encouraged him to continue with me. 

• We did argue at times and when I would call him a pedophile/etc he would say “You were the age of consent so nothing illegal happened” and imply that being the age of consent equals being an adult. 

• However, we never had sex and he was pretty serious about waiting (although he did try on one occasion and I firmly said no)  

• I would usually say no to giving or receiving oral sex too and he would always pull it out and start begging/pouting and touching me. 

• He was extremely possessive but I was too so I’m unsure what to think there. Being around the opposite sex was always a problem. 

• We had no physical contact something like 6 months before I turned 18 and I broke up with him soon after because I couldn’t get past my feelings (for months I couldn’t stop thinking about how messed up he must be)

Despite all of this, I truly believe he’s a good person at heart and I’m not trying to ruin his life. It’s been years now and I’ve moved on, but I just need someone from the outside looking in to tell me if, besides really perverted, he was also abusing me sexually or any other way?

Edit: a lot of responses are somewhat focused on the legal aspect of the relationship. I really don’t care what was illegal or legal, I’m not trying to make a case. Just trying to process a part of my life I’ve been blocking out.

Edit 2: I was just reminded by someone that sent me a PM that a few months after we broke up a conversation about child abuse was brought up while we were in the same circle. He pulled me to the side afterward and asked if he had ever hurt me. I asked what he meant in asking that, but he never elaborated.

t3_chq9d4,My husband won’t accept my daughter’s bipolar diagnoses and says she just needs to be “disciplined”,"My husband (m, 33) and me (f, 30) are at odds right now over our ten year old daughter. I have bipolar disorder but I don’t take medicine for it and never have. And now my daughter was also diagnosed with bipolar a week ago. Craziness runs in my family, my uncle has it and he doesn’t medicate either, and my mother is schizophrenic. So I wasn’t surprised to find out. I always knew especially now that she’s older, that my daughter had issues. 

My husband doesn’t believe in any of this. And I feel like it’s my fault for always downplaying my own, and never going to treatment for it. But I know how my daughter feels and my husband is giving her a really hard time.

He tells me “she’s not crazy she just needs to be disciplined”.

I’ve always been very protective of her from him even before I knew because I felt like I knew how to help her not him.

All my kids love him but he can be very intimidating. He yells a lot. And I know she can be scared of him. And it doesn’t help when you’re manic or depressed. 

My husband won’t speak to her psychologist and is telling me to pull her out of therapy and do not put her on meds, or he will do it himself.

But I want to atleast give her the chance to see if it helps her.

The point here is that my friend just simply saw my boyfriend's face and then she press ""nope"" (she did it so fast and can't undo to check again). So for now that is everything I know - my boyfriend has a Tinder account. I have no idea what is on his profile, or if he is still using it, or if he just forgot to deactivate after he's been a thing with me, or whatever it is. 
We've been a couple for about 9 months and nothing has gone wrong. He was really nice to me and arguments have never happened. I've been thinking about borrow his phone to check when was the last time the app is opened or if he was chatting with some other girls all the time. Shoud I do that? I really don't want to be a sneaky girlfriend, but that is the only solution I can come up with, except for a face-to-face conversation cause I really can't ask him directly, at least for the moment.

My SO for example, will not even ask me about my day (or may just ask 'wyd') and then instantly go on about how bad things are at work and life and these paragraphs after paragraphs of drama. I have friends as well, do the same thing. I listened to one friend talk for hours about how great they are at their job, how under-appreciated they feel and shitty their lives are, and on and on. I'm just so mentally exhausted. But at the same time, if I ignore them (or their messages) I feel guilty about it. I feel like I'm the asshole because I'm not being a good friend to them.

Also, I'm curious, do people just expect you to talk about your day as if they asked you, even if they didn't? Is that what I'm supposed to do? Because I usually don't. I've always kept to myself, and if someone asks the right questions I answer accordingly.

t3_chm2kr,Should I date or should I be alone?,"Title might be weird, but really that is my question. After some bad relationships, I realized that I have some unsolved issues, which might go way back in my childhood. I did not get enough affection as a kid so in my romantic relations, I would always be too needy, clingy, crave attention and affection, to the point that I could not bear being alone for a day. After realizing this, I decided to go cold turkey for a while. Which is not really happening to be honest, cause me and my ex are seeing each other sometimes as we are still good friends.

However, I stoped using Tinder or any other means of finding a date, stopped flirting and everything as I think I want to understand myself first.  On the other hand, I am thinking how can I get better at being in a relationship if I am not in one? So would it be better to try something casual with someone just to learn to become better at it?

t3_chq594,How should I handle my shitty roommate and her annoying/disgusting/inconsiderate actions?,"It’s long, lots of detail, I’d like some advice. TLDR at the bottom

Hi, so I’ve posted quite a bit on reddit asking for advice on how to deal with my roomate. Nothings really been working and that’s partially been my fault due to poor communication skills. I’ve already decided that I’m moving out October 1st when the lease it up, but I’d like some advice on how to not be completely miserable for the next 2 months and maybe not burn down the bridge with her after I leave. 

Some background: 
I’ve (20F) been living with my step sister (18F), who I didn’t grow up with, since April. I’ll refer to her as S. I was already living with another roommate but her mom was moving out of state and S asked me if I wanted to get an apartment with her. I agreed even after she said her boyfriend, A, would be moving in to. They had been dating for like 2 years and I met him a few times and he seemed cool. Week one I discovered that S had been sleeping with 2 other guys at our apartment while A was at work. I kept that secret for her a month until A came home early and found S in the bedroom with some other dude. a beat the fuck out of the  dude and I thought he would move out and that’d be it. That unfortunately was not it. The next day I go to pay rent and A wants to go with me, I’m like “oh fuck”, and we’re driving there and he asked me what’s been going on. Apparently S convinced A that the dude was just a friend and A needed to hear that from me I guess. I told him the truth because I felt so bad and honestly thought he deserved better. They break up, he moves out, and S says she can’t afford the master bedroom and wants to switch with me. So now I’m paying more rent than I wanted to. The inconsistency is just beginning. 

After A left I learned that me and him did the majority of the cleaning because HOLY FUCK did our apartment just suddenly get way dirtier. She would throw acid and moly parties and not clean up the garbage and mess for 2 days. She leaves dishes in the sink even though we agreed to put them in the dishwasher. She wont scrub the dishes and just let the food get stuck on and wonders why nothings clean. She honestly hasn’t taken out the fucking garbage once since we moved here even though her parking spot is the closest spot to the dumpster. She has the guest bathroom and it’s too embarrassing to let people use it that I just let them use the one in the master because I keep it clean. She has the grosses room I’ve ever seen, I don’t really care too much about this as it’s her own personal space, but if I clean the house within a day the common areas look just like her room. She never vacuums. She smokes a pack a day and hasn’t thrown away any cigarettes from the patio so there all just sitting there. I don’t go on the patio, even tho I’d like to, because she’s turned out there into her storage area. There’s all her boxes and a bag of stuffed animals that’s she didn’t want to throw away. This stuff irritates me to no end and I’ve talked to her about her mess numerous times. All she told me was that she’s a “kid” and “doesn’t know any better”. I told her that she’s a fucking adult not a kid and needs to act like it. Part of being an adult is cleaning up after yourself so your roommate doesn’t have to. 

For a solid month there was either a new tinder dude or like 5 of her friends in our apartment. She wouldn’t give me a heads up sometimes and I’d come home and want to relax and I can’t. One of these friends was my old roommates gf who I very much disliked for many reasons and expressed this disliking for to S asking her not to invite her for,but she decided that she was “in love” with this girl and they started “dating”
for like 2 weeks. This girl eventually got evicted and banned from our entire apartment complex because she tripped the fuck up on acid and banged on 3 of our neighbors doors at 2am telling them to get out of “her house”. Fun times. 

One time I wanted to have my little brothers over, one is 10 and one is 5. I put it on the calendar and told her a week and a day in advance. I asked her to take down the pictures she drew of naked women, hide her bong and rig and put her playboys away. Sleepover day came and she didn’t. I ended up rushing to clean up everything before my step mom, not related to S, came to check the place out. S also decided to invite over 6 of her friends that I’ve never met, one of which brought a big ass pit bull and didn’t tell me. It ran into my room and made me jump but scared tf out of my 5 year old brother. They also were smoking weed in the house. I asked her to stop and she told me “it’s not that big of a deal”. 

About a month ago S and A started seeing each other again. I really didn’t mind I just thought it was weird to be around them considering that I was the one who told the truth to him. So I started staying in my room whenever he was over. But then he started being over EVERY FUCKING DAY. I asked S if A and her were back together and she told me no..? I asked if he was moving back in she told me no...? Why is he over everyday and why are you fucking and still going out? Then that day I got home from the beach with my gf. S isn’t there, I start cleaning. 2 hours later I go to put her beach towels she let me borrow and wash back in her room and went to give back the towels. I open the door and A is just chillin in bed. I also noticed that my missing sheets were on her bed, again, after I told her not to.  I throw the towels on the bed, say sorry, walk out. I text S asking her why she has my sheets, I don’t like the idea of my sheets that I’m sleeping in being the same ones that you’ve fucked multiple dudes on, and why is A here. She said she’d wash the sheets and then played the victim saying I give her anxiety every time I text her about something and that she cant feel comfortable in her own home. I told her the only time I text her is to let her know that she left the back door wide open again even tho the AC is on or that she left all the lights on and left the house again. And I told her that I don’t have a problem with A being here, I’m just not comfortable with him being here when you’re not home. I thought that was reasonable enough. I thought wrong apparently because she hasn’t talked to me since then. I’ve said a few things to her about my social worker coming over or me not gonna be home but she has not initiated a conversation. A has been over every day. And true house is fucking disgusting again So I’m basically trapped in my room because I’m just not comfortable with the mess. I’m not good with confrontation, but I’m fucking angry. I don’t want to hate her because we’re basically family, but I’ve come to resent the hell out of her. She’s a horrible person who can’t even take care of herself. I don’t want to be confined to my room anymore, I have people over and not walk into a messy cluttered house. I don’t even know what to do anymore but I can’t live how I’ve been living the past month for the next two months. What should I do? Any advice is appreciated. 

Also any revenge ideas are also welcomed 

TLDR; my awful roomate/step sister got back with the bf she cheated on, who I told she was cheating and he’s over everyday. She literally never cleans the house and it’s gotten to the point where I’m basically confined in my room. I’m moving out in October but I don’t want to live like this for the next 2 months.",relationship_advice
t3_chg2vs,When did dating become a second stage?,"Like back when I was younger, dating was not exclusive unless stated, and if you were flirting around with a person and going on dates, you were dating. It wasn’t really something that needed stated. 
But I’m noticing now, you “hang out” and after a bit someone will ask the other, and then you are “dating” 

I’m pretty sensitive and like only one person at a time usually, and if I’m “hanging out” usually consider it dating unless we are just friends, but lately I’ve been corrected a lot. That it’s only dating when asked. I thought that asking meant you were going the bf/gf route?

t3_chq4wi,How men vs women operate “textually”,"From personal experience and hearing peer experience...I despise the “game” that is texting. The wondering when/if you should reply to someone’s text. How it should be worded. Not replying purposefully. There’s been this plague of thinking that if you respond too quickly to someone, you could be seen as “desperate” or “overly eager”. This idea that “I’m going to purposefully NOT respond which will make them want me more or make me seem not desperate”. God forbid if I text them back quickly enough, they’ll know I have feelings for them!! I feel like with quite a bit of women, it’s more of a “game” vs men. I think most men are so involved with their own lives and texting someone back is not too much of a concern. With that said, it’s frustrating because speaking from experience, women I interact with respond fairly quick over text. As for men, for the most part, respond hours later, if not the next day or not at all. They’ll sometimes leave the conversation completely open. 

This is where confusion lies if a guy is interested in me or not. Are they focused on their own lives/doing their own thing? Because let’s face it...if a guy really wanted to talk to me, he would..right? How does texting on your behalf usually sound/look like if you’re truly interested in a woman?",relationship_advice

She says she would rather go home early from a night out with her friends to be with me rather than stay until late (although she agrees she is not that close with her friend group after some irrelevant events a couple years back) We have had more than one conversation about this and although she agrees that you can’t really judge how good a time a person is having by how long they stay out, she simply gets this feeling and cannot switch it off, even though it might be irrational, which I understand.  Am I blind to how I am being hurtful? We live together and I would never even compare my time spent with her to time spent with friends. I am not bored and thoroughly enjoy her company. In addition, what we do when staying out late isn’t wild partying, but just conversation as usually the next day everyone leaves and we don’t meet again for months. She had met these people and has spent time with them, however she does not come out on these night outs as she feels out if place between 5 guys with a common past (last time she was with us for dinner and later she had plans with her family so she had to leave).",relationship_advice
t3_chm0rv,Vent/help?,"I’m sorry the title isn’t a lot to go off. I’m (19F) currently in a long term relationship with my boyfriend (22M) and we have been together for 3 years. Recently I have noticed changes in the way he looks at me and talks to me compared to how he does with his other friends and other women. He seems to be happier around other people than with me, and he seems to enjoy talking to other women more than when talking to me. I feel like he is beginning to get bored or complacent with me and that i no longer excite him or make him feel in love and we are just together because we are used to it. When we are together it feels like I’m just with a good friend, we do have sex still but nowhere near as often as we used to, so when we do have sex it’s really good. I don’t think this is a sex issue.

I’m starting to feel like he’s bored of me even when I make special effort to dress up or to do something nice for him he doesn’t really think twice about it. 

I’ve brought up how I’m feeling to him. He said that I’m the one with the issue and I shouldn’t be constantly looking into things to make a problem out of nothing. This is the first time I’ve really felt like this and I try to brush off small issues as I realise I may be over sensitive sometimes and they are never really an issue. I also got the message that he was implying I was insecure and insecure in this relationship so pretty much turning it all back on me.

I am really in love with him and don’t just want to give up over something that can easily be moved past, I just don’t know how to bring it up to him without him turning it into my issue and getting defensive. 

Me feeling like this has caused issues within myself in the way that I want to meet new people and have fun with people who seem to enjoy my company and want to talk to me and that I make them happy. It’s like I’m seeking attention, especially from men, who can give what my current boyfriend isn’t giving me. I’m starting to have a crush on a certain guy who I have only seen 3 times when I’ve been out with my boyfriend or friends, we have been talking recently (not in any malicious way just as friends and talking about mostly school). I don’t want to get any deeper into this because I know how wrong it is and that I’m in a relationship but I just can’t seem to feel complete with the way my boyfriend doesn’t seem to love me the way he used to anymore",relationship_advice
t3_chq41g,[27F] Pre-engagement jitters or correct gut feeling,"I \[27F\] have been with my boyfriend \[26M\] since the final days of high school. We have organically reached a point where engagement is the next natural step. He is very comfortable with the gradual ascend, so are our families. But off late, I find myself struggling with the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to be clear, I absolutely agree with the institution of marriage and this is the man I want to spend my life with.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel insecure &amp; uncertain about formalizing our relationship with a marriage. So many wonderful people get blindsided by cheating partners. People who seem perfectly normal during decade long relationships turn out to be abusers as soon as they get married. I have heard married people say that love flies out the window to make room for complacency &amp; comfort. We don't plan on having a child and statistically couples without children have a higher infidelity/divorce rate. Tying oneself legally would be stupid if things go south. So does \*not\* formalizing it &amp; ending up with nothing overnight if things go south. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm loyal to a fault and have no tolerance for serious lies(even in friendships). Our relationship has been very exciting &amp; romantic all through the years. So all the things listed above are nightmare-ish. I'm not someone who has the strength look past a 'drunk slip up' or find comfort in complacency just to keep the relationship together. I don't even wish to be that person.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm generally very jovial, so I don't know where are this pessimism &amp; insecurity is coming from, and so I don't even know how to handle it. I hate these brand-new doubts but can't seem to put them away. I tried talking to my boyfriend on multiple occasions, but it always ends up with him calling them jitters and reassuring me with sweet words.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if these are merely jitters or my gut trying to warn of me what I can't see just yet. I'm looking for outside perspectives, so your comments are welcomed.

\[Extra info : He is the only guy I've ever dated, while he has had his share of dating experience before we got together and the while we broke up for some time during college. Neither of our parents nor any of my aunts &amp; uncles are divorced. I've had a good childhood. His father used to sometimes hit his mother when he was younger, and it affected him enough to promise himself that he'll never be that man himself. So we have gotten aggressive during some major fights over the years, but his physical or verbal aggression was never directed towards me or self-harm. He earns nearly double of what I do, in addition to his well off family. We have had our share waxes &amp; wanes, still do. But overall, it has been very good.\]",relationship_advice
t3_chq3ru,Me (23 F) and My Girlfriend (25F) are having post ending our LDR growing pains but they're harder than I thought.,"  

My girlfriend and I have been long distance for four years. We moved to a major city and we’ve been living together for about 4 months now and things have been *okay*. I’ve started to realise that we have two different levels of determination. I’m very pedal to the metal and kind of a workhorse. I like to know that my bills are paid, my work is done and that I’m going above and beyond to make sure that I’m meeting my best potential. She on the other hand is comfortable kind of doing the bare minimum and just skirting by. Sometimes she’s not even really skirting by.

She gets GI bill money for school and was kind of living off of that but I know that she might not have it forever and needs to start working toward getting a job in her degree field. She didn’t enroll in classes for the summer on time (even though I’d been nagging her about it) and as a result – she didn’t have a source of income. That’s when she realized that she needed a job (also after I sat on the couch and cried at her for being irresponsible with both of our lives) – even though I’d been nagging her for several months. As such, I’ve been carrying the majority of the bills. She has a job now, but it’s not paying enough for her to actually cover everything, so I’m still footing the most of the bills. 

She comes from a family that didn’t particularly teach her how to be a responsible adult. I have to constantly nag her to take better care of herself, brush your teeth 2x a day, did you get a shower, can you please wash the dishes, can you take the trash out, can you help me fold the laundry etc. I love her to death but I find myself being frustrated by the things that she just *doesn’t do*. She went to the dentist and she’s going to need reparative work in her mouth… close to $1000 worth because she’s not taking good enough care of herself. When I try to tell her that the things she’s doing are detrimental she feels like I’m trying to shame her, or like I feel like “my way is the only right way”. 

I love her, she’s sweet and I feel like she’s been dealt a bad hand. I know for a fact that her parents were not great and didn’t give her the necessary tools to take care of herself, and then scold her when she doesn’t know how to do things in a healthy and responsible manner. I don’t want her to feel like she needs to change for me – she needs to change for herself. My mom is starting to worry that she’s becoming more of a burden on me. I don’t really even know what to do. I don’t know how many times I can lecture her, or how many times I can just grin and bear it and not say ""I told you so"" before I start to lose my mind. I’m not at my wits end now but I’m afraid eventually I will be. I’m afraid that I’m not gonna end up being her girlfriend, I’m gonna end up being her mom. 

I guess I just – I don’t know what to do.",relationship_advice
t3_chfvuq,Should I leave him even he claims he’d kill himself ?,"I’m sorry for the formating but I’m on my mobile. I’m also sorry because this post is going to be long.

So, I (18F) am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (21M) and have been for just a little over a year. However, we see each other pretty regularly. I’m quite at loss with this relationship and I could use advice. I honestly want to leave him but I’m afraid of what he could do to himself.

First of all, my boyfriend is extremely needy. He constantly calls me, wants to spend all of his free time on the phone with me, even if he’s not free and at work. He texts me literally every minute of the day, and double texts me if I don’t answer fast enough. He’s also prompt to get mad if I don’t answer his phonecalls immediatly, and will call me every minute until I answer(his record being 34 phonecalls in a row). He’s also super jealous, and gets suspicious if I don’t answer my phone. He has already called me a liar because I wasn’t answering my phone (I had no battery). He also wants to know where I am constantly, what I’m doing, with who.

He also wants me to constantly reassure him of my love for him. There’s not a phone call where he doesn’t say « Do you love me ? I bet you can’t love as much as I love you » or « Promise me you’ll never leave me ». It makes me uncomfortable, and I voiced it multiple times but he won’t change. He also asks weird questions like « What would you do if I died ? You wouldn’t get back in another relationship, would you ? ». He’s also telling me every minute that he loves me, that I’m the reason he has strength. He calls  me by sweet names every minute.

When we are physically together, he’s super clingy. He wants to hug me all the time, hold me every second. He even wants to hold my hand when we’re eating at a restaurant, which is absolutely not practical. He can’t go a minute without saying « I love you » or calling me baby. He adores PDA, even in front of my parents. I don’t like it and I’ve told him because it embarasses me but he doesn’t see a problem.

I know he has serious abandonment issues, after being emotionally and physically abused by his mom, during his childhood, and then abandonned by her. He also has being cheated on by his ex. I have always listened to him talking about his trauma, but unfortunately, even if I love him, I am not his therapist. I have encouraged him to seek help from a professional but he doesn’t want it. He also uses it as an excuse to manipulate me. Like, if we have a fight, he’s violent emotionally (he has even pushed me violently once), and will after apologize by saying that it’s not his fault, that he’s like this because he had to build his life all by himself and couldn’t count on the emotional support of his parents.

All of this make me suffocate in this relationship. Even though I love him, I want to leave him. I’m not feeling comfortable anymore.

But, he has expressed several times his desire to die if I were to leave him, so I’m truly concerned with what I should do. I honestly love him, and I wish him the best but I just can’t do it anymore.",relationship_advice
t3_chq2rz,"My lack of initiative and tight-fisted attitude in my relationship has put it at breaking point, and I don’t know how to fix it.","I’ve been seeing my girlfriend for ten months now, and over this time she has often complained that I rarely ever make an effort with her, and never take her out on dates or make plans myself. Most of this is fundamentally down to me not wanting to spend excessive money as we are both on a budget and at university, but this attitude has become problematic in our relationship.
I should clarify that she never expects me to pay for everything, and on dates (although few and far between), we always pay half and half. I’ve recently had the realisation that clearly I’m the problem here, and being so complacent and unimaginative in a romantic sense has made matters difficult.

Last night it became too much and she said she does not trust me to change my ways and treat her better, and the most important detail was that I was hesitating on a planned trip to Amsterdam for a few nights to celebrate her birthday; I argued that along with anniversary celebrations and a mandatory course-related field trip I have coming up, I just couldn’t afford it. Realistically, I can, and have savings built up and untouched. I suppose I’d just like to keep it that way, but I’d rather spend a bit and have a fulfilled relationship. 

Ultimately, I just really need advice on how to apologise to her and make things up to her. This is difficult right now especially, because during the summer, this is a long distance relationship and due to some personal views on my family’s side, it is impossible to invite her to my hometown. Sorry if this is a bit convoluted and poorly structured, I just really need to figure out how to win her back. Thanks in advance.",relationship_advice
t3_chq2ak,My (25f) boyfriend's (30m) best friend (33m) is hitting on me and my boyfriend is in denial,"

So my boyfriend Craig has a best friend Eric, they've known each other since they were in college. I didn't ever get along with Eric that great but recently things have gotten worse.

The two of them hang out once or twice a week, oftentimes at the apartment Craig and I share. And Eric seems to be hitting on me, and Craig is in total denial saying Eric is just an outgoing warm guy and he doesn't mean anything by it

He hasn't done anything obvious enough to point a finger at, but it's the sort of situation where little things get picked up as weird, kind of unconsciously. Like seeing someone stare for too long, always want a hug and hold on for longer than is normal, ask questions that toe the line of being too personal, etc.

The breaking point for me was when I was sunbathing on the balcony and I hadn't known Eric was coming over so I was spooked to see him staring at my through the glass doors that opened to the balcony. I yelled at Craig to come over there, and asked to talk to him alone. I said I was getting more and more bothered by his friend, I had been sunbathing and he'd been staring for IDK how long. And unless things changed, I wasn't cool with him being in the apartment.

Craig said he'd talk to Eric and tell him that I wanted to be left alone, and I said that wasn't enough, he should be specific about stuff like him not being welcome back unless he totally stops staring and trying to ask me shit I don't want to answer, and coming around me acting ""friendly"" and shit. 

And he said he wasn't going to say all that, that it was like I was trying to put words in his mouth and end his friendship.

I was so fed up that I booked a spot at a campground and I'm staying there for the time being. But that's not sustainable.

Can I have some advice? How do I get my boyfriend to see his friend is not really a friend to him or our relationship?

tldr - Boyfriend's friend is being weird and flirty around me. It bothers me when that happens in my own home where I just want to feel relaxed. I don't feel like my boyfriend has my back here",relationship_advice

t3_chq0ur,I don't feel like I'm being the best boyfriend for my girlfriend.,"I'm 18 M, she's 19 F.

We've been together for 4 months and I absolutely love everything about her. She's pretty much everything I could want. She loves spending time with me and when she went back home she texted me saying she really loves and misses me and would hate if I died (we were talking about depression and stuff before she left). I'm her first boyfriend, and her first kiss, and she says I'm the only person she has opened up about things with other than her mom.

But I just feel like I haven't been the best boyfriend I could be. I have major depression, ADHD, and sociopathic tendencies and severe insecurity for most of my life. My family describes me as a perfectionist and when things aren't the perfect I can get easily disturbed (even if it's taking a shower, everything has to be laid out perfectly).

My gf is amazing and I just feel like she could do better than me. I'm slowly learning to be more social and it feels like she's holding back her extroverted-ness to match my introvert speed.

I don't know what else to say but I want to say more.

EDIT: Thought of some more: I over-analyze my texting and play it safe with her in fear of her getting annoyed with me. Back in middle school I used to be a very extroverted person, but come high school I realised I was annoying and shut myself in. That's probably part of why I can't express myself and be open.",relationship_advice
t3_chpyvj,How do I (22) get over my gf (24) kissing another guy during our break? TL;DR," **TL;DR**

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so here we go. My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years after one year the distance became long-distance. Reddit, I don't know what else to say, I know people are gonna say it's the typical cheesy story and all that bs. The cheesy stuff is cheesy because it's true. She's smart funny and we love all the same stuff down to the really weird stuff like favorite insane YouTubers and all that. I've always told her communication is key and we've been pretty good about it. On and off for the past two long-distance years, she and I have had stupid, petty fights that we knew were dumb and we would never have in person. In-person we're amazing as well as the distance, I imagine though that it's natural for us to get into these petty fights due to the frustration of being long-distance. That's why we always came back and brushed them off. The thing is Reddit, we had a petty fight last week that reached a place it shouldn't have and then she broke up with me but it was a break up during the heat of the argument that I felt she didn't mean.

We gave each other some space for about a week and then after a week, it was her birthday. I sent her a birthday text and she simply ""loved it"" as in the message and then sent ""thank you, love you too"" I couldn't take it anymore, I texted her and for some reason she just kept telling me to move on and I kept thinking how is it that after a week she's speaking to me like I'm some stranger? Then she proceeded to call herself a shitty person and that I deserve better. I kinda kept pushing with my words as in I just kept kinda asking why she was acting like this and I told her she's the only one for me. She got mad and said I always put her on a pedestal and she's a shitty person and not as great as I think she is. Reddit she and I are good loyal people, and the thing is, her life after she had to move is not a great one, she graduated, moved away from all her friends, she is now working two jobs and paying off loans, her parents are always fighting and her dad is a very strict and religious dad who basically doesn't let her have a life at all. She even told me how she thinks she's a shitty person because of how much she's lied to her dad and the reason she lies to him is about stuff like going out and all that. Her dad is a control freak and that was something we also bonded over, our parents never let us do anything in high school and in college, we only got a smaller amount of freedom opposed to that. She has very few friends and yeah barely ever hangs out with those friends as it is. She is constantly paranoid of her dad finding out about us. It's messed up because sadly her household is one where the dad's approval is what matters, her mother and sisters know about me and love me. This made her love for me even stronger.

After I texted and pushed her enough because I was so confused and not about to let it end like that, she finally came out and sent a long text that started out with ""I let another guy kiss me"" she said she regretted it the second it happened, she only has feelings for me, she felt like shit, she's disgusted with herself and hates herself, and she was questioning how could I be with someone like her. Reddit idk if anyone else feels this way but the last fucking thing I wanted to know were the details but I still had to ask for some sort of closure, I asked how and where did it happen, she said he snagged one from her just before she and her girl friend were leaving. I asked how long it was and all that crap and she said not long but she wanted to stop talking about it because it made her feel gross. I respected that and I told her that it was ok, it was just a kiss. She doubts that I'm this calm with it but she said she hopes I keep true to my promises and never bring it up or any of that. Guys, I love her so much and she's living and incredibly hard life out there, and technically she and I were broken up for a week and it happened about two days before I texted her again and we had this conversation. Reddit I feel like I made the right decision but how do I get the thoughts of this asshole kissing her? He's into her and she said she's not going to entertain him or let him believe he has any chances. How do I get myself over this one little kiss? She's going through a lot and the last thing I want to do is dump her and make her mental health even more unstable than it is. I don't want to break up with her, she's the one for me, but how do I get this one little kiss out of my head? How do I stop letting these thoughts take over? I can't stop the paranoid thoughts of her maybe secretly enjoying that kiss? I can't stop thinking about how trust was kind of broken but I guess technically we were broken up, it's obviously just irritating because it was literally five days after we broke up and we usually come back to one another. She said she let him kiss her but he kinda just went for it and caught her off guard, she didn't insinuate it or anything. In her long text she kept telling me how awful she felt and that she recognizes how I only want her but she was having slight doubts about us and then after that she asked me how could I want to be with someone like that? This isn't something that I ever thought we would have to deal with. I know that technically trust isn't broken, she once felt guilty and facetimed me one day about a work party the night before where a guy tried to get a kiss from her but she backed off and said she has a bf. She facetimed me telling me that and said she didn't want to keep anything which tells me I should trust what she said about this guy. I feel so powerless, I just wanna punch that guy because I can't get over how smirky he must feel for snagging a kiss like that when I'm almost sure he knows about us, maybe he doesn't idk. Guys what do I do, I don't want to let her go and she doesn't want me to either, I handled the situation in a mature manner but that was through texting, texting doesn't show my inner thoughts.

t3_chpwms,My friend is constantly passive-aggressive,"I (18F) have known this girl (20F) for 6 years, and we were very close at first. I considered her my best friend. We talked every day, and we were sincerely happy with each other. She was always supportive. We are both very introverted and at the time she had no other friends than me. I had, on my side, but she remained my number 1.

For 2-3 years, our friendship has clearly deteriorated. Before that, we had never argued, and I could express myself naturally with her, talk about anything and everything without worrying about her reactions. Today, every conversation, on any subject, is hijacked.

 For example, today I told her about that american city I like a lot (we are European), and she replied that what I said was abberant and that I did'nt know anything about this city, that it interested me only because of the pictures, landscapes, and what people are saying on the internet, and that I had to go there to find out. She said that America doesn't interest her and that it was stupidly overrated. From my point of view, it was an innocent and enthusiastic remark about something that interested me, I never claimed to be an expert. This example is gentle compared to others.

I won't give other examples so that the post won't be too long, but it's necessary to know that each discussion turns out badly. All. I'm not exaggerating. She contradicts everything I say, every day, when I'm happy about something or interested she breaks my joy by brandishing only bad sides, or by making me understand that it doesn't interest her, therefore it's stupid.

When I'm complaining about something and looking for emotional support she tells me it's my fault, defends the thing that annoys me, and tells me what to do.

I have already tried to talk to her several times (3 or 4 times), trying several methods. I was sweet, I was direct and straightforward , I sent her a YouTube video of Anna Akana clearly explaining why her attitude was putting our friendship at risk.

Each time, it turned against me. She has no trouble insulting me (it happens very rarely but it happened), criticize me, make me look like an idiot, but she can not question herself. It never happened. Never. In 6 years. She never apologized, and when she is wrong about something she is a victim. ""You're very rude right now, you're hurting my feelings,"" and then she stops answering for several days. I took the blame and apologized several times just to maintain peace. 

I'm having a hard time supporting this situation and even when I'm doing my best to avoid the conflict, it appears in every conversation. I feel more and more stupid by talking to her. I know that I am very naive, but I am young and I constantly question myself. My self esteem is diminishing from days to days.

Some information I did not know where to place:

-I had a depression in high school, and I was completely isolated. After high school, I took a sabbatical year which isolated me even more (I hardly go out anymore) and I start college next year, and figure skating to be invested in something. I have absolutely no friends. I do not talk to anyone outside of her, and I would like to arrange things with that person whom I once considered my best friend.


-She never confides to me. She asks me to tell her all my life and my feelings in detail but when I return the question she refuses to answer. In the end by keeping   everything for her she becomes frustrated and passive aggressive, which falls on me (my theory). 

What can I do to save this friendship? 

PS: I'm new on reddit and this is my very first post, sorry if I did some mistakes. I'm still learning English so it's not perfect. I hope it is still understandable.

t3_chlv3l,"Help, not sure if being abused","So a bit of background I have been dating my boyfriend for 4 years. 

For the most part things are fine, we happily spend time together and share common interests. He actually recently splurged on me for my birthday. But the problem is the little things.

For example, he is incapable of apologising to me if we have a fight. When I say that he has upset me, the best I get is 'I'm sorry you feel that way'. He also will not accept any responsibility for wrongdoing. When I point it out he shuts down and will ask to not talk for a few days. When I call him out on my feeling that I cannot share my issues with him, he won't talk about it and will sleep on the couch, as if to prove my point. the last time I raised this he said it was because I had spent all day in the house and was obviously depressed.

I'm currently sick at the moment and he has said that I need to cook dinner for myself and made remarks when he thought I had left dishes for him to do. If he's sick I wait on him hand and foot.

He will bang on about how he loves me more, but won't sit down and talk to me. I have caught him not listening to a word I have said on multiple occasions but he calls me a liar when I say that I had in fact told him something. He's so worked up about that he now often 'file notes' our arguments.

He's an incredibly smart man but I sometimes feel as though he holds that over me, despite the fact we have the same degrees and jobs. He's also a golden child in his parents eyes, so I feel a lot of this may come down to how he has been raised.

The thing also is, he doesn't exactly take no for an answer. I mean, he will just grab me then expect sex or after he finishes once he expects me to keep going. Because I've just had an injury I am often not in the mood and instead of respecting that he will touch hinself in front of me and even follow me around the house continuing to touch hinself, begging me to touch him, until I say yes. I have broken down crying before because I don't feel respected, which is met with the 'I'm sorry you feel that way'.

He also does not believe my injury is severe as it is and will sigh loudly when I say I can't do something.

Despite all of the above, he can be very selfless and thoughtful. We are often in a very happy place but when any of the above happen it makes me doubt my whole relationship.

t3_chpuod,I [M20] recently started seeing someone [19F] but I am about to leave the country soon.,"Hi, first post here, so sorry for poor format or anything else that I mess up. 

This summer I stated an internship about 2 hours away from my normal home. I live here Monday-Friday and then drive home on the weekends to see my family and friends. In the beginning of the summer I matched with a girl (we will call her Jane) on Tinder and have been talking daily ever since. Due to the fact that I work during the day for 8 hours, Jane works mainly at night, and I have been driving home on the weekends has made it really difficult to find a time that works for the both of us to hang out. Last week we got dinner together and this week we have already spent two nights doing stuff together and plan to do something again on either Saturday or Sunday. 

Another important aspect is that I am leaving the country in about 3 weeks for almost 15 days. And once I return she will have already left for college and I will be starting the semester soon as well. 

I am definitely starting to develop feelings for her and believe that she is doing the same for me. But, we both go to college and our schools are about 2.5 hours apart, so it isn't an impossible distance to make work out but I have never been in a long distance relationship and I'm nervous that it might not work out because we have only spent a little time together in person even though we have been messaging each other for over a month now. Jane has said to me that the time we have spent together in person has been really fun and has enjoyed it a lot.

Last night after our date I told Jane I never intended to develop feelings but I have started to and want to hang out with her more. She never specifically stated she had more feelings but did say that she wanted to spend more time together before I leave the country in 3 weeks. So it seems to me like there is definitely something between us, but the fact that I am leaving the country and then for school makes me hesitant because I don't want to establish strong feelings when they could lead to nothing. 

I also don't wanna be too pushy and force anything either. Any advice on what I should do in regards to handling this? ",relationship_advice
t3_chn0oo,TL;DR Plus Size Lingerie recommendations?,"I (24F) am going to spend my first weekend with my long distance girlfriend (30F) in 2 weeks. We have never had an overnight visit and have not had sex yet. That is the plan for this visit. I have also just never had sex with a woman in general. She mentioned that she will be bringing “a few lacy pieces” that she can’t wait for me to see. I don’t have any, and have never even looked for lingerie. I am nervous because I am a bit bigger than her, but I want to wear something pretty for her too. I just don’t know where to start. I would be too self conscious to go into an actual store to shop.

t3_chpqcb,I feel like I’m nothing to him 🤷🏼‍♀️,"My boyfriend (18) and I are dating a very long time ago but he is constantly texting with other girls since the beginning of our relationship. I told him that it makes me sad and disappointed. After it he finished texting with these sluts but i found some disgusting messages. For example he asked them to send him nudes and he gave them his snapchat name. I consider myself a good looking, skinny, well-groomed girl. I’m nice and clever. I love his family and he loves my family too. Sex was better in the beginning, he doesn’t want it like he used to. I would do everything for him, i really love him more than anything but I don’t want to do this while he is texting with those girls. But he keeps saying to me that I’m perfect for him and beautiful.

They have been friends for around a year too and nothing has happened. He kissed her but she rejected him and then he tried to have sex with her as well. Then she told him to leave and he tried to kiss her again. She is very loyal and I know she wouldn’t do anything like that especially not to my best friend because she doesn’t see him that way. He does not seem apologetic because he keeps texting her asking to hang out and she keeps making excuses not to see him. She told me all of this yesterday. What do I do ?

t3_chpo7u,Are young men usually this bad about their feelings?,"First time posting here! Hello! 

I don’t speak to my younger sibling much and he’s never been open about his emotions, which is why I’m coming to reddit for answers. Title is for click value more than anything.

My little brother [M16] is friends with this girl [F16] at our church. She’s absolutely beautiful, intelligent, kind, religious, the whole nine yards.

They talk to each other online every day. I found out from my parents that she obviously likes him- and maybe I have a skewed perspective of him since he’s my sibling, but I don’t know why on earth a girl that great would want anything to do with my bro lol. It seems that she actively subtly tries to pursue him, but he keeps it strictly friendly.

My parents said that he likes her back, but he doesn’t want to do anything until he has his “ducks in a row”. They say he thinks she’s the one for him, and he sees a future with her. Essentially, he’s planning on dragging this out with her for 5+ years until he’s through with school, has a working profession, etc etc. 

Is this something guys normally do? String a girl along until they’ve established themselves, no matter how long it may take? Nonetheless, a girl that they think is the very best for them and a person they cherish, rather than just another average chick? It seems stupid to me, as I’m a person who runs with my passions as they come. 

TL,DR- little brother and wonderful gal are into each other, he thinks she’s amazing but won’t pursue until he’s in his 20s.",relationship_advice
t3_chpnli,My wife cheated but we're still in love,"So it's a pretty long story but I'll try to summarize as much as possible. I recently found out that my wife that I've been married to for a few years and in a relationship with for even quite a few more years. She's blamed this on her giving up on our relationship due to the some issues on both our sides over the last year. I searched her phone and saw texts and pictures with another guy. After finding out, she continued speaking to him. I was upset for a few days after, but started blaming myself for making her unhappy and making her want to cheat. I've pretty much been begging her for a relationship and giving her all the power. Hence, she's the one that has been deciding whether we stay together or not. There is no doubt we still love each other a lot and I want to forgive her and move past this. How can I fix this and take control of this situation after I've already showed so much weakness and needyness?

She blames me for pushing her closer to the guy after I caught her because she had nowhere else to turn to and I kept attacking her emotionally.

The reason I can't give up on her is that I've cheated on her with multiple girls, before when we were just boyfriend and girlfriend. We broke up for a few months, but eventually got back together and our relationship was stronger than ever. The breakdown in our relationship is in both our sides.",relationship_advice
t3_chpn8e,Wife of 10 years wants to date another guy while still being married to me. She thinks she has feelings for him. I am not sure if she will come back and I can handle this.,"Long-time lurker of this sub, hoping that i never have to post here. What an idiot i was. I desperately want advice. My whole world has been turned upside down and I don't know what to do.

Backstory: My wife and I got married when she was 20 and I was 22. This August marks our 10 year anniversary. To celebrate we are going to London and have a bunch of activities planned.  We also have a beautiful 4-year-old daughter. Currently, I work full time and my wife looks after our daughter, throughout school years she does tutoring and this summer she enrolled in university to get a teaching certificate to become a teacher. I love them with all my heart, this is why making this post is hard. I cannot eat, I can't do proper work, I feel like I am going to puke my guts out. Oh, and I only had 2 hours of sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

When we first got married, when it comes to marriage my wife was very conservative. I, on the other hand, was opposite. She did not like that I had female friends and over the years I stopped talking to my female friends to make my wife happy. She is the only one for me. While I believed that boys and girls can be friends, over time I grew conservative and adapted her views.  Initially, it was hard to let go of my friends but over time I accepted and and moved on. As the time went by my love for her and commitment grew even stronger and I did not care about other girls at all. This is easy now because I cannot think of ever loving another girl like I love my wife. But the fact that I went against my fundamental believes stuck with me. (this is important for later)

&amp;#x200B;

As time went by, throughout years, she grew to be less conservative. Throughout years of our marriage at least once or twice a year, she would always say/ bring up that she got married too young and regrets that she did not get to experience total independence. We would talk/argue about then we would get past it and move on until next time.

&amp;#x200B;

For a couple of weeks now she started talking to this guy, who was a childhood friend of hers that. Initially, i thought it was harmless hey they are friends!... the Petty side of me took over and I told her, that long time ago she asked me to stop talking to my female friends, she would have no problem if I asked her to stop talking to that guy. She agreed and she told me that she stopped. but she didn't. We had an argument, and she told me that she definitely stop talking to him....

&amp;#x200B;

for some time I thought it was over, but she has this look on her face, whenever she does something that she thinks it's wrong, she starts smiling and looking away. When I asked he whats going on, she would say nothing. After pushing her for some time it turned out that she is still talking to that guy..

&amp;#x200B;

Man, I was so angry, first that she lied to me, second that she was doing that behind my back. We agreed we needed a break.. so for a week and a half, we just did not talk to each other until she figured out what she wants to do.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, she comes back to me and says that she is done with that guys, she chooses me and we are back again being one happy family. no... yesterday she told me that though out our first break. the messages from him became more explicit and sexual. And she liked it... but at the end apparently she had an argument with the guy . and the guy told her that to keep talking or meeting up or sleeping with him.. she needs to be single. she did not like that. and she got mad at him... and she came back to me. she blocked him. She was visibly upset how their relationship ended... which sort of was a red flag...

I was sooooo happy that she decided to come back. the amount of weight that was lifted of my shoulders felt like i was in heaven.

Yesterday, she got that same smile on her face. which i picked up right away. After i confronted her, looks like she unblocks the guy and gets some sort of closure.

(this is the worst day of my life). after I cooled off, we talked and she said she has feelings for him and she wants to know where their relationship will go.  She is super attracted to him. With me, she says the spark is gone.  out of 10 attractiveness level, she rated me 1. I look decent, I am 5 10 and weigh 187 lbs.

&amp;#x200B;

But she feels super comfortable with me. She wants us to keep being a family until she figures her self out. She said she will always regret this if she does not try things ours with him.

Please, guys, help me figure this out, I wanna save my family. What should I do? Sorry for this jumbled mess, My brain is a complete mess. I don't even know if what I wrote makes sense.

We had a trio and made the mistake of getting excited about the other person. When I saw that it was a mistake I tried to amend it and apparently it was not too late because my wife was willing to forgive me and move on.  
The problem was that for work, she went to another country for a period of 6 months and shortly before coming back home she began a relationship with the same guy.  
Upon arriving at the house, her idea was to end our relationship, but for some reason she did not do so and we decided to try again with couple therapy.  
She says she still loves me but she is still attracted to the other guy, and I think they still keep in touch via chat.  
Among the initial agreements was that if we tried, she would cut contact with him.  
I love her so much, to the point of being willing to forgive and forget, but I am in the internal struggle if I understand that it is difficult to undo an illusion and give it time or take a side and follow my life.

t3_chplac,"Girl I have had a crush on for a long time finally told me she liked me a week ago, but now she’s saying she doesn’t know.","BACKSTORY

Okay, so her and I have been friends for, let’s say the past 6 months or so. I have always liked her, even when she had a boyfriend and I had a girlfriend (yes I know, bad OP). 

She hasn’t had an easy life, she has had to live with her grandparents for the majority of her life due to the fact her dad was on drugs and in jail and her mom was an abusive alcoholic. Anyways, her most recent boyfriend was black, and her grandparents (who she lived with) are extremely racist, they found out and kicked her out of the house, threw her clothes out of the yard, it was a big ordeal. 

—

So then she moved back in with her parents, her dad is now like 3 years clean and a good guy. I’ve been included in conversations about it with them and she says he’s completely changed and she loves him, he’s never done anything bad to her. I fully believe that, I personally like the guy. 

Her mom on the other hand, well, she constantly verbally tries to talk shit on her when no one is around but puts on an act when other people (me) are around. They have had multiple fights, the mom starts stuff for no reason, has spit in the dads face for no reason, used to be an alcoholic, but now is just high off her ass 24/7. Due to that fact, M (let’s call her that) went to the separated back house to live with her dad, which she is perfectly happy with. 

—

Anyways they break up, because she found out he cheated on her multiple times. This happened around three months ago. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of like two years, so then me and her started to hang out. M and I have been hanging out literally every single day of the week except for when I had to go on a three day trip to visit a college out of state. This has been going on for about three weeks now. 

About a week ago, M told me that she liked me (she had already known that I liked her) so yanno i say okay, keep hanging out with her. So then a couple days ago, I was invited to come with M and her family to a water park about 2 hours away. We spent the whole day there, had a great time, I drop her off at her house around 10 and text her and ask her for clarification if me and her are “talking” or not. She says she doesn’t know so I ask her if she even wants a relation and then she says  

“No I mean like I do I’m just struggling”

I ask what she’s struggling with

She replies with this: 

“Idk how I feel honestly my emotions are so fucked up and the walls I’ve built to protect them are so high idek how to get around them I want to like you but when I try I get like super sad like In your car on the way home I was crying and idk why Bc we had a great day but I got super upset and all I wanted to do was go lay down and cry in the dark and idk what the fuck is wrong with me”


So then I replied with 

“I didn’t know you were crying I’m sorry :/. And hey if you don’t like me, it’s okay. If you aren’t ready for a relationship or if you just can’t like me it’s okay. You do have walls that you’ve built up and it’s for a good reason. You haven’t had an easy life and I don’t want to pressure you into anything. If you don’t want to like me it’s okay. Obviously I really like you and want you to like me, but if you can’t it’s not your fault. I am kinda confused because you said you did like me, but it’s okay. I’m sorry.” 


After that, she just apologized and kept saying she didn’t know. 

I really like this girl, I love spending time with her, she’s beautiful and just all around amazing but I have no idea what to do. Sometimes I feel like I’m on top of the world like when she told me she likes me or even just asks if I want to come over. 

But I also feel like I’m fighting an already lost battle, I just need someone with a fresh perspective to look at this and tell me if I’m crazy for still wanting to wait and try.",relationship_advice

t3_chpkg3,I don’t want to help my boyfriend anymore,"Hello everyone. 
So me and my boyfriend have been together for around 2 years. And have been living together (with my parents) for around 1. 
He is 22 and just decided to start going to school since he finally saw that his job is super insecure and he didn’t even got any work for more than 2 weeks. 
I am 20 and am a college student and I also work 2 jobs at the moment. 
I was very happy he decided to go to college or get some type of certification. 
However, he wants to become a police officer which doesn’t require you to go to college at all. I told him to look into it and maybe he can just get a criminal justice certification which the school offers. But he doesn’t listen to me. 
Alright if he doesn’t want to have a job till he is 30 whatever. 
He went to ask in the college and they gave him practice tests to do at home before he do placement tests.
What pissed me off super much is that for the past couple of days he comes over with his brother and they stay up till like 5 in the morning. I can’t sleep good and I have work every day in the morning and what is more it’s not like he practice those tests till 5 until last night. He haven’t done any math for more than 3 years and I offered to help him since I went to professional math high school and I just took math in college, he accepted and we went thought quite a lot. Then his brother came who just graduated high school and started explaining stuff to him in another completely different way. He got the answers incorrect 3 times and kept arguing with me that they are correct for more than 20 minutes even after we put the equations on a computer and they showed that his answers were wrong. Now my boyfriend still decided to listen to him  and completely ignore me. He was just laughs like it is some joke. And he went on to “do tests” with his brother till 5 in the morning when for a first time in weeks they called him for work. I got very very upset but didn’t say anything. He hardly woke up for work and he went super late there.
I know he will ask for help when his brother is not around and I am thinking to not give him any. In my head his actions are not only super irresponsible but also not considerate about me and all the work I have put till now in my schooling and to help him with something.

t3_chpk7s,"Am I in the friendzone, being used, lied at or just overcomplicating my relationship to a coworker?","About 3 years ago I (35M) met a coworker of mine (lets call her Sam) (30F).

We are working in the same company but in total different section so we only got to see each other sporadic.

Sam is the kind of woman u can talk about every bullshit on this world and she is super casual. Doing ""sexist jokes"" about women at work herself etc. She feels like a super cool buddy to hang out with.

On top comes that she outed herself to me immediately being a lesbian.

Seemed to be a plus cause we could hang out and talk bullshit without any sexual tension building up between each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years we became good friends and started chatting about whatsapp etc. when not at work.

&amp;#x200B;

This year in april she was transferred into my section and now I´m her supervisor.

She is the only employee in that specific section, doing her job amazingly fine and that makes it quite easy to work with her cause I cannot prefer her over someone else and even if I have to assign tasks to her she really dislikes we are still super cool and chill with each other.

&amp;#x200B;

So far so good.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing each other on a daily basis for 9+ hours gives u a lot of time to talk. And I found out she is a super introverted person in her private life an barely leaves her house and most of the time plays videogames or hangs out with her sister and niece.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me that I am the first person in years where she could be herself and that made her super comfortable and she was genuinely happy being around me.

She jokingly brought up the fact that we would be the perfect couple for being friends with benefits because we both didnt have a partner for 2+ years.

I got a little confused about the fact her being a lesbian and how that should work out.

Her response:

""Why not just try it, I mean we are super chill and even if it wouldnt work out we could still be good friends""

I thought about that a couple of days and figured out that she might be right. I never had feelings for her in the way of her becoming my girlfriend. Even though she is super sexy.

We discussed the whole situation for a few more days and agreed to give it a shot. We stayed after work in the office a couple of times and started kissing and making out - but not any more.

&amp;#x200B;

A week after that she called me down in tears and told me she couldnt do it and couldnt bring up enough feelings towards a man to have sex with him.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her that I am absolutely okay with that - which I am ... or ... was.

&amp;#x200B;

It took us one or two weeks to get back to normal and everything seemed chill.

She told me she wanted to change her life after she and wanted to go out of her house, meet people, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day we have never met outside our job.

Then she brought up the idea that we could hang out together, play some videogames, get some food and just chill.

That being said ... she cancelled EVERY appointment we made for meeting up and doing sth together outside our job.

I asked her what was wrong - ofc nothing. She just didnt find the time, was exhausted etc. etc. Silly long list of excuses.

""But next time we could totally get it done and she would come around or we meet up at her place""

&amp;#x200B;

That went back and forth for ... I forgot to count how many times.

I got disappointed by that behaviour a little and decreased the amount of time spent with her at work, texting etc.

She got sad about that and told me she wanted the old times back and that we would ""definitely"" meet up at the weekend. Again ... couple of times.

With her moving to another appartement, her sister and niece and the stress of the second job she does she again - always canceled every time.

&amp;#x200B;

She recently started hanging out at work with this other guys (lets call him Mike) (23M) who is the ladykiller at our job. He always tells his coworkers how many girls he had at the weekend, shows around nudes of girls from the region etc.

And then out of nowhere she dropped in a subclause that she was spending her day off with Mike.

Okay ... she got to know him 3 months ago and despite me telling for ages that she had almost zero time on her weekend she quickly hangs out with him.

This week she asked me to leave the job early on friday cause she had an appointement with her gynecologist. And again dopping in a subclause that she needed to get a ""contraceptive"".

&amp;#x200B;

So back to topic - am I overthinking this whole situation?

Am I getting lied at.

Am I being used by her to be chill at work and have some fun with stupid smalltalk.

&amp;#x200B;

I really dunno how to approach her because I feel like she just wanted me as a good friend to make it as chill as possible for her at work but nothing more. Maybe the whole ""friends with benefits"" was a stupid idea and she realized it. But her suddenly meeting with this guy + the fact her telling that she needs to get a contraceptive although she is a) lesbian and b) not in a relationship

&amp;#x200B;

To get things clear - I didnt fall in love with her. My job requires me to leave this place in about 2 years and I wont return there. So I am aware of the fact that any relationship would be doomed that day so I not letting my feelings free. I like her ... as a super close friend - Yes. But the whole situation confuses me and I feel a little taken for a fool.

&amp;#x200B;

I even confronted her about the situation about Mike and her meeting up while she told me like 100 times she wanted to hang out together and then cancelling with absurd excuses and she felt sorry and promised me that we REALLY REALLY would do sth. at the weekend. I told her she doesnt have to pity me and promising me to hang out with me if she didnt want to but she got mad and said it wasnt true. She genuinely wanted to spend time with me cause I am her best friend and the only person she could talk to about everything in her life.

t3_chln5c,"I [19M], don't know how to deal with a relationship with a girl [20F]","I've been having a lot of doubts on how to procceed with a relationship I'm trying to form with a girl [20]. To summarize, we met again on the 10 of November after 5 years of silence (last times things hadn't ended well, because, in my opinion, she exhibited some very problematic personality traits). From then on, the things became more and more intimate: we had our first date, I gave my first kiss, but when we talked about taking the relationship to the next step, she'd always say something like ""I don't deserve you"" or ""you're too good for me"". I tried to understand that because I really believed she meant it, so I made an effort to postpone my feelings. The thing is that, even when she told me that and I told her every romantic-related aspect of our relationship needed to end, she still gave me ""mixed signals"", doing things that we agreed to avoid. I always told her I didn't want a casual relationship or an open one, so this needed to be either a friendship or a full romantic experience. Also, I told her to tell me if she found someone else for those romantic or sexual purposes (because I was, inevitably, falling for her). The thing is that she did had someone else. We talked about the possibilities of something romantic or sexual happening with him and she told me that nothing like that would happen and, if that was the case, she'd tell me beforehand. The point is that, in fact, she had a number of sexual encounters with him (he lives in another city) and she told me about it after she returned from her trip and had some romantic experiences with me. Granted, we were nothing at the time and when I tried to explain her why that hurted, she wasn't a very receptive person, dismissing everything with the phrase ""we are nothing and I'm a very sexual woman"", which is true but the way she handled the things were quite hurtful. But the point is that I've thought about that and accepted what she told me and I framed every detail of what happened around that vision, dismissing my hurt feelings and trying to adapt to the situation. I see now that I loved her much more than I loved myself and I was willing to leave my self-respect if that meant forming a relationship (whatever that may be) with her. So, for a month we tried to be friends, but she still attempted to do some romantic and/or sexual things with me (sometimes I stopped her effectively, sometimes I didn't, which is incredibly silly from my part). Finally, on February she moved from the city to the same place the other man lived to study. The two months she was there were awful, because she totally ignored me, even when, before leaving, she made me promise her I wouldn't forget her, talking as much as we were used to do (and, trust me, that was a lot). Moreover, she came to the city many times and I saw her only once: the meeting was awful and she didn't dedicate me more than 15 minutes of conversation. Some things happened and she had to return to our city and, seamlessly, everything went back to normal. Retroactively, I heard she had started a relationship with the other man, being that the reason why I was relegated during those months. 

Everything went smoothly after that. On the 25 of May she had an awful incident with the other guy: he told her she never loved her and that he only used her for sex and because he was feeling alone; she cut every form of contact with him and our relationship got ""revitalized"". Because of how the things developed, we tried to move the relationship to a romantic plane, but when I was about to confess, let's say, the other guy came back to her life and she accepted him. Things go downhill from there: she started showing less and less interest, every plan we had was cancelled, I couldn't see her and everything I said was used against me, framing myself as a manipulative and toxic individual. Granted, you can see I developed a clear emotional dependance, but as soon as I realised that, I asked for professional assistance. The thing is that I needed to see her to explain what I was feeling. She was avoiding me and every question I asked her. I truly was making an effort to build something healthy (even if it was just a friendship), but I feel that she never cooperated and never will. I mean, everything I told her was purposefully distorted, making me look like an awful individual, even when I was trying to reach middle ground. 
The point is that I asked her for some Time to think about things. What are those things? Well:
1) Forming a friendship is worth the emotional and mental burden I experienced?
2) Could I (and should I) give up some affective necessities in order to keep her close? (i.e. she doesn't enjoy meeting other people in real life; I do, but when I tried to be democratic and reach a middle ground, I don't know, like, meeting 3 or 4 times a month, she called me toxic and manipulative)
3) Could I tell her every little thing that hurted/hurts me? And, will she be willing to understand and cooperate with me?
4) Will she be responsible affective-wise? Will she care about my feelings and the relationship? Will she treat me better than she did these past months?
5) Could I make her understand how the way she handles and delivers information is problematic? (i.e. we had some plans and she never cancelled them; I invite her on Friday, she rejects me; I invite her on Saturday, she rejects me; I invite her on Sunday, she rejects me; I invite her on Monday, she rejects me. After that fourth invitation, she told me she didn't want to see me and that she had been ""afraid"" of telling me. I also learned that she met with the other guy who was visiting the city. Oh, and she also said I was being very insistent and emotionally manipulative just for asking 4 times and telling her it wasn't nice to leave me in the shadows, revealing her feelings on the very last chance)
6) I think I'm capable of growing out of that emotional dependance, but will she understand if I told her about how she exhibits some problematic behaviours such as gaslighting or a volatile personality (i.e. many times, she distorted and reframed the situations to make me feel like I was being unreasonable or the villain)
7) Could I form something healthy with a girl that never did an introspection? That hardly ever cooperated? That never recognised her wrongdoings and always painted me as a villain and a toxic man? Why I still think that my words could make her change this time?
8) Could I be friends with a girl that, even when I've been totally sincere, admitting my mistakes and asking her for some time, dismissed my feelings and, even worse, treated me like a manipulative, controlling and toxic individual, even when that's a matter of perspective? Even when we should be facing the problem and not each other? (Besides, when I told her she did some bad things too, she said ""everyone experiences situations differently"", but when I tried to use that idea in my favor, she rejected it, telling me she was right about me being toxic)

I've talked about it with a psychologist and with a girl who, for 8 months, was in this sort of limbo. I know that everyone experiences things differently and, in the way I told them the story, they never saw something manipulative or toxic from my side, besides that emotional dependance I talked about. I still think that we could form something healthy, but I need her to understand and cooperate. I just don't know if my eloquence could convince her. And the past experiences, well, are quite dim. I just need to decide if this is (or isn't) worth it. I'm super thankful for everything nice she made me experience but even if I greatly appreciate her, it may be time to end this.

TL;DR:  I don't know if I should try to reason with a girl that exhibited very bad habits (but always framed them as if being my fault and my toxic feelings) to ""save"" and build a potentially healthy relationship.",relationship_advice
t3_chimyu,Boyfriend broke up with me on eve of work trip. I am gone for three weeks. He couldn’t handle me being out of town for three weeks. Should I try to get back together with him?,"So I’ve been dating this man about eight months now, we have a great relationship. Very compatible in bed, we have a dog together, I am still in a lease at my apartment so I have not moved in but I spend most nights there at his place. 

We’ve never had a fight. We had a little minor disagreements that we’ve talked through it and work through. But for the most part I would say were happy. Both of us have expressed that were happier then we have or have been before.

My work is sent me on a three week trip about 1000 miles away. I left Sunday. I don’t have a choice. I have been in this career over 10 years. And normally I will have to travel in the state maybe once a quarter for 1 to 3 days, and out of state once to twice a year for three weeks.

My boyfriend broke up with me the night before I flew out.  He told me to go home that he was not going to drive me to the airport in the morning. And that he did not want to see me again.

He claimed  that he would’ve never dated me had him knowing that I had to travel for work. I asked him if it was he didn’t trust me? No, it’s that he doesn’t want me to go. He’s going to be too lonesome without me. And that he’s afraid that I will come back and not feel the same way about him as I feel now.

He’s offered to find me another job but he’s not gonna be able to find something that I enjoy doing and makes as much as I do. I make close to 80,000. he’s offering to find me a job in his field as a legal assistant making about 40,000 at best.

I think he’s just overreacting but at the same time I can’t stop crying. 

We haven’t talked since Saturday night. We normally talk daily. I sent him a text saying I landed and made my destination. He didn’t reply. I think this is the silliest break up I ever had…

Am I the only person who thinks he’s being silly that breaking up over me not canceling my mandatory work trip?  Everything else was great in the relationship... I don’t know what to do next…

Generally if we disagree we talk it over until both sides feel understood and then come to a compromise.

I’m AFAB and I identify as agender/nonbinary, but I still exclusively use female pronouns and I present fairly female. I know 100% that I don’t have the same experiences as him, but I want him to know there’s someone in his corner. 

My question is, what’s a good way to start the conversation? We’re not super close, although we were when I was a preteen/teenager. I feel like it’s weird to just pop in to say “hey I’m not cis either lets *bond*”. The other problem is I don’t know how explicitly out he is because I’ve heard about this second- and third-hand. I don’t want to make him uncomfortable, but I want him to have an empathetic ally.

Ultimately, my sister (pan) and I want to be able to take him out and get some gender-confirming clothes and have some talks about gender identity so that he feels heard because so much of  what I’ve heard frames this as a phase and that he thinks he’s a boy.

I know she cheated on at least more than one occasion and was sleeping with other guys during the off period. My mind is going crazy and Im unsure what to do?",relationship_advice
t3_chmp94,My(28m) heart aches because I can't speak to a friend(24f) I was intimately involved with.,"So first and foremost I know I'm one of the bad guys. An asshole. 

Now long story. Back in 2/2017 I got a girlfriend. Around the same time I got a new coworker(the girl in the title). Also at this time I only really had one friend. He was my best friend and meant the world to me. I was also in the best shape since high school.

So my coworker already had a boyfriend, but I always caught her glancing at me. I was a new manager in another department so I never really had any reason to interact with her. Eventually i was invited to go and have a drink with my coworkers after work and she also happened to have tagged along. She poked my cheek when I was trying not to stare at her too much and trying to keep it cool, and from then on I knew there was some interest. Eventually we got closer, more flirty conversations, grabbing drinks alone together, pecks on the cheeks, even her offering sex (I blew it because I misheard the arrangement and she thought I rejected her so she got hurt). 

So here comes 12/2017. I broke up with my girlfriend. Ya know how they say that when you meet someone you're putting on your best self to attract the person and it takes a while before they get to see the true you? It took me this long to finally see all the red flags. I would admit that I was wrong in arguements and would apologize, and she wouldn't. It was a relationship and i was trying to make it work, but it got to me that she would try to win every arguement, even the pointless hypothetical ones to the point she would raise her voice at me or even curse at me in some serious instances. Eventually the sex became just work. She wanted me to only do it in certain positions and would cum like 5 times and then push me off to stop. After a while I just stopped becoming interested in sex and that just exacerbated the situation. I also gained a lot of weight which made it more difficult to maintain erections and if we would get into a dumb arguement, I wouldn't want to have sex so she would just leave making me feel dirty. So I threw in the towel. I never really felt bad when I left. I felt the relationship ran its course.

I do want to add she knew my coworker existed. My gf offered a threesome and one day when I was having an intimate convo with my coworker she also said she was interested and would like to be our third only if my gf would be the third in her relationship. I told my gf and she got excited and said she should have some 1 on 1 intimate time with coworker to make sure all 3 of us would be compatible. I didn't like this and told her sure, if I also got 1 on 1 time and my gf was not happy and stopped talking about it and avoided the convo whenever I brought it up. I didn't really care because I was honestly happy just having a gf that I could have sex with, but this did open the door for my coworker and I since we did show sexual interest and this put a bad taste between my gf and I since i knew she was selfish.

So all of 2018 I played around with my coworker. Kissing, fondling, her teasing me with her bits. Most of this was me initiating, but she did initiate a few times. It helped a ton since she was having trouble with her bf. He was depressed and unemployed. They both suffer mental health problems, but I really never saw any of hers and only heard of his. I did offer emotional support to her and sometimes some financial. (I would let her take stuff from our job for her to sell). I would also buy her gifts but nothing extravagant (less than $20)and just for her bday and Christmas except once when I saw the cutest patch of a cat showing its butthole for like $2. 

There was also heartbreak two instances: her wanting to stop flat out(rejection hurts) and another I got over eager(she said she would break up with her bf if he didn't get a job by a certain date and I got over eager a week before, he didn't get a job and she still ended up staying)

Finally at the end of 2018 my Best friend stopped talking to me. He completely ghosted me. He had done it before and I left him a voice mail apologizing and he spoke to me saying he was depressed and had just needed time to himself and that I did nothing wrong. Well now I called him and texted him several times (no voicemail), but i never got a response back. I figured it was due to the stress of him not getting the job he has been going to school for,, but I figured he would eventually reach out. He didn't(and hasn't).

In 2019 she got fired. Work was dying and she was let go because of it. It did suck, but I was glad because I wanted it to be over. I gave her advice to not give up and that she still had 2 checks coming, but I could already see her sinking into her depression. I asked her if we were gonna keep in touch, but she said, ""I barely have enough time for my friends."" I did try and keep in touch and would sometimes message her with advice to help her get a job, but it didn't really feel she was interested in texting back.......  A month later she got rehired which I wasn't happy about, but I kept my mouth shut. It was weird when she came back, but it eventually went back to flirty behavior between us. She was telling me she was applying for new jobs so I knew it was only a matter of time. 

Finally on 5/19 she quit. She came to talk to me and we hugged, said our goodbyes and she apologized how she left the previous time. She looked hopeful and happy, and I haven't spoken to her since then. I see her on Facebook messenger, but she never reaches out nor do I since I know her bf uses her FB. 

Well now its present day and I saw her on messenger and I felt so much heartache and jealousy. I don't know why I still feel this way. I've made new friends and we set up a weight loss challenge and I'm finally working on bettering myself. They are genuinely good people and I find it astonishing that they just welcomed me into their life. 

Is this something as simple as I just need to lose the weight, delete her on Facebook, and get laid?


I do want to add. I have been was with other women in 2018. I went on Tinder and brought some ladies back to my place, but I couldn't get a boner.......I'm guessing my weight and confidence were the problem for that. 

Also I know she wasn't just flirty with me. I don't know how far she went with other guys, but I know she spent the most time with me........

t3_chmott,"Wife wants to get a tattoo for a miscarriage, I don't want her to.","My wife and I have been married for a few years. We've been trying to have kids, but unfortunately even to try we would have to do IVF with donor sperm. We can't afford that at this time, and it will likely be 5+ years before we can. Adoption isn't an option because this isn't an overly liberal area and an atheist + Jewish couple doesn't sell well. I and my wife also frequently travel for work, so fostering isn't available either.

She got pregnant earlier this year (not mine, no infidelity). Abortion came up, and while she was too down to care for herself, she couldn't get past ""killing her only baby"". It wasn't possible for us to just ""try again"" and I couldn't promise her the treatments we'd need to actually try. We would have dealt with it if the pregnancy had lasted, I guess. I don't really know. But this pregnancy couldn't pan out, and it didn't develop properly. She ended up losing the child around 16 weeks.

She was devastated. She's always wanted children and sobs whenever someone announces a pregnancy. I've been doing my best to support her. She's in therapy, and as part of it she wants to get a tattoo with a fairly large flower and what would have been the due date. I don't want this. I acknowledge it happened, and I 100% feel bad for her, but I don't exactly want to look at a physical reminder of it every day.

This entire year has been horrible for both of us. I feel like a tattoo of this is just commemorating a horrible time. I'm also really uncomfortable with the idea that apparently the most emotionally significant thing to happen to her is a failed pregnancy created outside of our marriage by trauma. 

This sounds bad, but the fact of the matter is this wasn't my child and isn't the same thing as getting a donor. Maybe in time it would have grown on me and I could have played along, but I just wasn't all in like she was. I feel weird about mourning that that couldn't happen and having to look at a memorial daily or have all of this just on display. She has pictures and a physical gravestone. I'd feel similarly weird about having those pictures framed and out, and I don't visit.

Pregnancy loss isn't really mourned in my family, and a pregnancy outside marriage definitely isn't. I'm not trying to be insensitive, but it seems very creepy. I even feel bad that a failed pregnancy is getting more time and money devoted to it than many children that are living in the world. Maybe I'm just an asshole, I don't know.",relationship_advice

She went on a family vacation, and while she was gone I just knew I needed to make the commitment. I went to the jeweler and chose a ring that I think fits her, fits us, and looks beautiful. I feel like it shows how much she means to me and I honestly think it would look stunning on her. I have plans to propose tomorrow, but I'm starting to worry because last night she mentioned something about how she likes the contrast of a gold ring with the diamond, etc. etc. Therein lies the problem, because the one I bought is white gold. It just seemed like the right ring when I was looking. Obviously I know she loves me and appreciates me and every gift I've gotten for her. I'm pretty confident she'll say yes and tell me it's a beautiful ring, but now I can't escape the thought that she secretly won't like the ring she would wear for the rest of her life.

Sorry if this all seems like a jumbled mess. I guess what I'm wondering is, should I be worrying this much? Am I overreacting to a comment about a ring when I know deep down she loves me? It's making me anxious and I just need to see what other people may think.

t3_chgo8q,Am I overreacting about husband’s coworker?,"My husband got off of work about a while back and told me a female coworker slipped him a sheet of paper with her phone number on it, which he threw away apparently in front of her. Later, she confessed to having a crush on him but acknowledged he had a wife and was just trying to be friends. 

Months passed and I started to become suspicious because he was privately messaging her photos on social media often of this and that. I let it go thinking about how many people do that with our friends, until I found out he was leaving her little notes on her desk at work telling her things like “I hope you have a good day” and so on. Next, he admits to me that she asked him to hang out with her outside of work, which he turned down, which I felt proved he is trustworthy. He really has never done anything to prove me otherwise! Eventually, he admitted to me that he had actually deleted private social media messages and text messages from her because he didn’t want to deal with my reaction. I admit, I’ve given him a very hard time. I of course jumped to conclusions and thought about how people always say, “once you delete texts or hide things, you’re probably already cheating”. Additionally, we often get into each others phones and pull pranks like posting silly pictures etc, and one day as I was about to do that, I noticed he had locked me out of his phone. 

Well, time passed and we were having some general relationship problems, as all of us do. I was feeling insecure due to these issues plus the other things going on. He continued to develop this friendship with her and admitted to me that he had confided in her about our problems, including telling her personal and private things about me, as well as telling her that I had been suspicious of their friendship. Really, just giving her many details about all of our problems.

I felt betrayed, not because he had confided in a friend, but because this coworker has admitted her feelings toward him, and because he told her very private things about me. After hashing it out and him denying any sort of feelings toward her, I felt we were getting over it, but I still feel suspicious and uncomfortable with their friendship. At the same time, I feel that I’m overreacting, displaying the very unattractive trait of jealousy, and just need advice.

t3_chlfw8,My girlfriend wants to go with her ex boyfriend to a concert,"I've (M17) been with her (F17) 4 months now, and it's been 4 months in which my life has changed so much for good (stopped using drugs, focused on school, beat depression).

 A little backstory, about two months ago, I joined her and some of her friends to a playback of what is one of her favorite bands/my favorite band. I don't really like the setting because I don't enjoy being with a lot of people in a crowd, but it felt nice because it was our favorite band, and I was with her. We were singing along and it was really nice, the closest I've been to a real concert, but then I noticed she getting sad and started crying. I asked if something was wrong and she just kept repeating everything is fine, but she was still crying, talking with her friends behind me, and using her phone a lot. When the playback finished she turned to me and said ""Okay, I wasn't sure if I should tell you but I've consulted it and now I see I should. The reason I was crying it's because that band and those songs have attached feelings to my ex(M18-19) and past experiences with him, and I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you to feel bad. It is not that I miss him, but there are attached feelings and they hit because it was a really important moment of my life"". I didn't know what to say, I just told her is fine and kept on, but I got really really sad and worried. Later that night we talked about it and it was fine.

They were together little less than a year (about two years ago) and broke up because he moved to Boston (all this is happening in San Diego).

Two weeks ago, a friend invited me to a real concert to the same band. She wanted me to go because that band is a great bond for us and she could lend me money which I will pay later. I accepted, she bought the tickets.

Some hours ago, I went out with my girlfriend, and she told me her ex invited her to the same concert (I didn't invite her because I learned is not a good experience for me mixing her with that band). She said he wanted to buy her the concert ticket and he would fly all the way from Boston to San Diego, and she was thinking about accepting. 
I just told her that I don't feel comfortable with that idea and we left the situation on ""Stand by"" because I wanted to get my shit together about it.

My questions are, am I overreacting? Is it okay for her to go with him? Is it wrong that I feel a little bad about it? Is she being disconsidered? 

Her ex comes to San Diego every 6 months or so because family; about a month ago he invited her to his house (bc they are still friends), and I was taking her there, but halfway she changed her mind. She later told me she didn't go because he told her he missed her, and he was insinuating. We talked a little about that when I told her I don't feel comfortable and she said he said that because he was really high, and he just says that to anyone when he needs affection. I don't know how to feel about it, I really don't want to be an asshole and tell her not to go because she really wants to go to the concert. Not necessarily with him, but going with him is an easy option because he's paying.

t3_chlfvv,My Boyfriend does not know how to respond or is using me only for sex.,"me(f 23yrs) and my boyfriend(m 24yrs) has been together for 9 months. we've discussed about marriage and future plans and all but he tends to be not responsive at all. he has a very very busy schedule and also has exams coming up so i don't talk to him much either but he can go on for weeks without even a single text message or a call. even if i do text him he'd ignore them. he's not hiding me from his family and friends either. he's perfect when he's with me or when he does call. most of the time he calls when he's looking for sexual satisfaction. he'd spend hours and hours talking with me until i'd agree to show him what he wants and do everything he says. but right after he cums he'd be in a rush to leave. he doesn't answer calls most of the time and he doesn't call back for missed calls either. he doesn't even pick up calls from his mom when we are together. doesn't respond to his friends as well. but i can't go on like this. i'm used to my boyfriends constantly checking out on me and sending me good morning and goodnight messages which this guy never does. he doesn't seem like he's making any effort to be in a relationship with me he didn't remember our anniversary till i repeated it many times. didn't even know my birthday for months. if i'd want him to reply the only way i can get it done is by a dirty sext and him calling me only for his sexual needs makes me feel like he's using me. i've brought up about breaking up many times and he'd say that he's been busy and that's why he couldn't talk. he's very bad at multitasking and he'll change to keep me happy but i don't see any changes at all. i've argued with him so much, he actually ignored the message i sent scolding him so much and i'm leaving him. but he responded to my status in which i mentioned that i am single. he said ""nothing happened between us. stop saying stupid things and stop posting stupid  statuses"" i don't understand what to do with this man. i've told him that i want to leave him so many times he ignores that as well. please tell me whether theres any way of fixing this confusing behaviour or whether i should leave him and move on.",relationship_advice

t3_chle74,I don’t think my boyfriend is sexually attracted to me. What do I do?,"I’m a 19yo female dating a 23yo male. Not to toot my own horn, but I’ve been told that I’m a very attractive woman, funny, and goal driven. I have a nice figure/perky breasts/nice butt (5’5” 125lbs) and I take care of myself. He does constantly tell me I’m beautiful and sexy, and playfully grabs my ass/breasts, but that’s about as far as it goes. I guess I just find if odd that my boyfriend, who is on the heavier side because he doesn’t eat well or exercise, isn’t as interested in sex as I am. I don’t mind his weight at all &amp; I’m very much sexually attracted to him. In fact, my sex drive has always been higher than his in the past 1.5years we’ve dated. He’s been my first and only partner. He’s been with a lot of women before me &amp; has unfortunately cheated on me twice. I’ve been constantly wondering if I’m just not good at sex or if there is something wrong with me that I’m unaware of. I’m ALWAYS open to trying new things &amp; have bought multiple toys/lingerie to try and spice things up, but he never really seems interested. It’s upsetting that he doesn’t mind going weeks without having sex. I love him so much and almost every part of our relationship is perfect, despite the fact that we fight about sex. He does have a busy schedule and works late, but I’m busy too. We’re both free on the weekends to relax and unwind, so that’s when I try to initiate. I get turned down almost constantly, so I’ve just quit trying. I don’t think I could break up with him over the lack of sex. All I really want is for him to be open to making things more consistent, but every time I try to suggest it, he says the sex is fine and it isn’t a big deal that we aren’t having as much as I’d like.

t3_chldx5,"I (24M) have been putting up with my gf (25F) bad attitude for a while and yesterday I had enough, need to know if I am in the wrong.","Hi,  


The situation is basically that she is hyper critical of every movement I make, and is shouting at me nearly every day about things I feel aren't the worst.  


Example: I say I'm going to shower and walk into the bathroom without grabbing my towel on the way in, she will shout at me, ""TOWEL!!!"" Obviously I was just caught up in thought and once I return to the present I would have realized I left the towel outside and gone and gotten it no harm done to her life. There are about 8 other daily occurrences of things like this.  


I'm going through a shift at work, going into a managerial position which all started 2 weeks ago, so I have a lot on my mind and I did explain that to her clearly.   


The start of this whole fight was when we were driving to work yesterday morning, it had been raining very heavily and I was merging into a lane and didn't notice a car in my blind spot. I didn't hit the car as I was merging carefully because of the road conditions, the other car honked its horn and I returned to my lane. We were driving her car and the whole instance set her off again about how I do not care about her or her possessions. NOTHING happened to the car. I was being careful because I was aware of the road conditions.  


I am the only one that works (She is attending law school), I get home every day and do the dishes and make food and our lunch for the next day. She had an issue with the way I was doing dishes because I did not also wipe down the entire counter top and the french press. So now I've started doing that every time I wash the dishes. I am stressed the fuck out, I recently bought an engagement ring because regardless of the above we have been together for 5 years, I love her and really enjoy being around her. I just don't know how to breach this stalemate.  


Things I must remember at all times.  


1. After brushing teeth wash hands
2. wipe down counter tops and french press after doing dishes
3. reset toilet (our toilet needs a little knock to start the water flowing after a flush) BEFORE washing hands not after
4. Grab towel before coming close to the shower
5. Toast our lunchtime sandwiches before getting ready in the morning
6. When taking out trash remember to get the small trash can in the bathroom
7. When tumble drying the laundry shake out every item twice before putting it into the tumble dryer
8. When walking around in the house always wear flipflops
9. When driving her car shift the gears softly so she doesnt notice gears shifted
10. When driving her car and parking do not pull handbrake up too high and do not pull it up too quick
11. When driving her car be aware of all dips and bumps and potholes and never hit any one of them
12. When driving her car always be aware of every other car on the road

I am so over this shit, literally everyone we meet and everyone she speaks to mentions how great a boyfriend I am, whatever want or need she has is attended to and taken care of.

I am (19F) and my partner is (21M). We have been together for two years and we got engaged a year ago, and have lived together ever since. *Very* young, I know. At the time it felt so right, and for the past two years I’ve wanted nothing more than to be with him.

Lately I’ve been feeling different; I’m starting my first year of university in the fall, and I’ve come to the realization that I just want to be alone. I love him so much....I can see myself spending my life with him, and I really thought I would. I don’t want to make a huge mistake by breaking up with him now, but I can’t shake the feeling that I need to be alone. I’m so young, and I have so much growing to do. I’d never even been in a relationship before him, and I’ve never slept with anyone else. Our relationship is wonderful in every way but I feel like I can’t be in a relationship right now. I don’t know what to do.

For the past two months we have been doing long distance, I am in Europe visiting my family and he is in a different state for work. I am going home in a few days, but he won’t be back home until a 2 more months from now. Should I try to get my shit together and ready to move out before he comes home, and then tell him I want to break up? Should I wait until he’s home, and see how I feel? I want to break up on good terms, I don’t want to stay with him if I’m not happy and then begin to resent him.

t3_chld6v,M(28) In process of breaking up with my partner F(24) with multiple OCD/Mental stuff.,"Hi Reddit!

Long time reader, first time signing and actually writing here. Ive seen that you guys have great advices and you have that objective opinion about stuff that i dont see.

&amp;#x200B;

Bear my english, not my native language.  This is about to be long post.

&amp;#x200B;

So i dated this girl for a 1,5years before moving together. Basically we lived in ""long distance relationship"" because she is work maniac who has minute schedule from monday to friday and we only saw each other in weekends. I picked some few red flags about her in that time (impulsive, agressive behavior when things dont go her way, control freakish habits etc) but nothing major ever occured. She told me about her rough childhood (alcoholic divorsed parents, abusive, brainwashing to work like maniac,""you are good for nothing"" , eating disorder, mental illness (anxiety/depression), basically everything has gone shit in her life and he has no contacts to her family or has nothing in her life. She then escaped from his former life and moved in my city and here we are. 

Details about our personalities: 

I am stress free, carefree guy who likes to take his time in life, i dont plan my life everyday with tight schedule and im kinda messy person (this is important later)

She is the work maniac, everything has to be planned, monday to friday are work days and you cant have time off for yourself in those days, she is cleaning machine and im pretty sure she has germaphobia or major OCD about clean house. 

So basically we are complete opposite personalities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to moving day. Everything was always fine when we didnt live together, only few normal arguments here and there but overrall typical normal life. But the day we moved in 4months ago she turned into somenthing i cant describe. Physical and mentally abusive control freak in short.

&amp;#x200B;

My everyday life for past 4months has been living hell. Especially the cleaning part just messes her up along with the other mentall stuff. Like she has this complete organisation in our home, everything has to be like she has put them or she yells. If i put glass into the wrong spot in the closet, she yells and calls me idiot for not learning. If i touch dirty laundry or even the basket and dont wash my hands i have to clean the whole area because why the hell not? those are just the small details about cleaning.  This has just escaleded every week to even worse. She comes with new rule every week.  We have cleaning day once for a week. I do clean my stuff. (TV, computer, bathroom, coffeemaker, kitchen closets) and she will do the rest. On those days when se cleans i cant go for my own house which i pay rent for because im apparently a pig who just messes her cleaning up. I cant even eat in the morning when im leaving for the work because he has sleeping troubles. 

&amp;#x200B;

My spare time? I dont have any. She works evenings i work morning. I have 2-3hours to myself every day but in that time i have to open the bed, clean, broom the house, to the laundry, set up my meals for the work, showered, put new clothes that im gonna wear next day on the chair. [Every.fucking.day](https://Every.fucking.day). Then when she finally comes home around 7pm i have to be silent for next 2hours watching my phone when she starts working again. Like complete silence, not even a click of the computer mouse or she will snap. Then 9.30pm she goes to eat and watch TV (her relaxing time) and i have to move away from the living room to bed and be silent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mental Abuse? She controls my life. She says when i have to be where, makes your week shedules which i have to obey or she threaths to scream. She always threatens to break my stuff, kill herself, scream at me when i dont do what she wants or make me pay for her wasted time and ruining his career because i called her wrong time when she was working? You name it, those behaviors are sraight from the ""recognise mental abuse"" She also likes to punish me and humilate me from time to time. If i do some cleaning mistake she forces me to look on my personal made list about cleaning and how things has to be done. Or i have to take a tour in our home and look how everything is placed. Or if im in the shower and she decides to snap she can take my towel and forces me to walk wet, naked through the house to pick new one and then i have to wipe the floor because obviosly its now wet.

&amp;#x200B;

She also uses money as a tool of mental abuse alot. She has thrown my food to garbage many times because of some reason (maybe they were put in wrong self of the frigde), destroyed my belongins and always she makes me to buy new ones. I even paid this month rent because i make somewhat more money than she does, got her expensive birthday gift but havent still received mine after 6months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Physical abuse? She has snapped on 4month time 9times where she has either punched, kicked, break my stuff or engaged me physically. Not cool.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is small example of my life past 4months.

&amp;#x200B;

She always cries after breakdowns and ask for forgivness about her mental behaviour but they last like 24h and she is back at it. She claims that im selfish when i cant be his mountain of support and handle his meltdowns and im selfish for wanting to seperate. Im the reason her life is shit because i always mess something up (exp. put somenthing in wrong place or didnt take trash outside when she wanted)or if i fail to answer her call when im working and during the meeting when she wants to ask question Basically she blames everything on me for her life and im the one who is killing her with my mistakes i do because his mental capability cant handle those right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know deep down that i have literally done everything for her well being and i have given all my previous life and habits and stuff i loved for her and its still not enough. Still i have to hear how selfish brick i am everyday and why i dont give him enough love and listen to her when he is having rough time (24/7) or i mess somenthing up every single day and she screams at me for that. I am really starting to believe this is my fault that she is what she is. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the funny part here is. None of these rules she made for me doesnt apply for her. She can leave stuff around the house if she wants, she can do whatever she wants but im not allowed the same rights on anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i have reached a end of my understanding. I have to but my own wellbeing before her and im going to seperate her. 

&amp;#x200B;

The real question im here for is what do i do?  We had huge argument (typical scream, abusive behaviour and stuff) and i just left for the first time and went to my parents. havent answered to her for 24h. Im really afraid of what if she cant handle this and will do somenthing to herself, i will blame myself for some degree if thats the case and deep down im sorry because i couldnt help or give her the life she deserved. I also feel like im failure and coward for giving up so soon. Im a mess right now. I want my life back, my old habits, my friends, my feel of security and general mood. Everything has been just gray for past months when i have been surviving for both of us. Help me out reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do i do this process? What do i tell her? How i will handle the separation? Moving? What is she does somenthing to herself? Am i huge failure and should i try more? Maybe she could heal if she would go to therapist more often? Looking for objective answers from you dear reddit because im lost and dont know how to handle this break up professionally, i dont want to hurt her.

t3_chkn32,I (f 27) told my boyfriend (m 33) of 1yr that I loved him and got no response.,"So, from what I understand, I need to say I’m on mobile and to apologize for my formatting, and that this throw away account because he might also be lurking...? (Did I do that right?)

For context, I have said it to him in the past (7 months into the relationship) but I was incredibly drunk and the only reason I remember saying it was because he didn’t respond then either. I brought it up to him the following day and he was going to go along and pretend I never said it. We had the conversation as to why he didn’t feel like he could respond the same way and he tells me his logic behind waiting to say the L word. Basically he sees it as big of a deal as asking someone to marry him. 

We both have some heavy relationship baggage so I don’t question it or push him any further and accept that he’ll say it in his own time. Meanwhile, I’m extremely embarrassed and tell myself I’m not going to say it again until he says it. 

Fast forward, this past weekend we were spending time together and I finally said fuck it, I’m gonna tell this man who is incredibly kind and treats me like a princess that I love him and that I appreciate everything he does for me, this time sober as a judge. It was early on Saturday morning, just lounging in bed before getting up and I say the for letter word. He rolls over and he hugs me real tight for a little while. After the painfully awkward silence of him not saying anything at all, I tell him that it’s okay if he’s not ready to say it and that I don’t want this to feel like I’m pressuring him into saying it back. And we haven’t spoken about it since. 

I just didn’t want to go another day not expressing how I feel. Life is short and if I have feelings like that for someone, I’m gonna tell them. The last thing I want is to freak him out or make him feel negatively. And by no means am I putting an ultimatum on this either. I still want him to only say it when he feels like it’s the right time. 

The only thing I don’t get is, he has acknowledged in the past that he “feels that way for me” but won’t actually say the words. So I don’t doubt anything is wrong (yet) especially since we’re going to visit his family in New Zealand in a month. We’re also two weeks from our one year anniversary and I’m wondering if he’s waiting to say it then as a form of a gift? Idk But I’d love some male insight on this.

Have I put more pressure on him to say it back ? Even though everything in the relationship is fine, is it wrong to want to hear him say that he loves me?

t3_chmftk,am I being over dramatic?,"this guy (23m) and I (23f), who I kind of knew in college but reconnected with on instagram, had been non-exclusively dating since April. we saw each other pretty regularly, every few days, but the last time I saw him, on Tuesday night (two days ago), it had been 2 weeks since I had last seen him previously. He asked if i wanted to go get a drink, and I said sure, that will be fun; and we walked to the cafe from my apartment where he parked.

We get to our table and he says, before we even order, that he'd met another girl about a month ago and they had been spending almost every night for the last two weeks together, and are now planning on moving to NYC in a few months. I knew he had been thinking about moving out of our state, but it was really the spending every night with this other girl for 2 weeks that bothered me, since we had never spent that much time together. he basically insinuated that I work too much (i work full time, he works part time).

I started crying at the cafe and it was really embarrassing, and on the walk back I could not stop crying; it just was such a wave of shock and sadness. He said that he and this new girl were both seeing other people, so we could still hook up or whatever, and was saying he still really likes me, but I was honestly so bothered by the every night for two weeks thing that I just got angry and really upset and could not stop crying and went up to my apartment alone; I sent him a text message saying my feelings about it the next morning, and told him he didn't have to answer (he hasn't).

am I overreacting? it seems like he didn't expect me to react this way. I don't know, it was just really upsetting to me. to be fair, I went on a couple dates with a few different guys while we were dating, but I never spent 2 whole weeks with someone in a row; and deciding to move away together makes it seem like a pretty serious relationship despite what he says about them being non-exclusive.  what do you think?

We had a business together but she didn’t hold her end and I had to do most the work and it snowballed we ended up having to shut down. We grew too big too fast and imploded. Well now about our relationship. She just got pregnant it was by accident she had an iud and somehow I guess since we have rough sex it dislodged and well now there’s a baby coming. She has some undying need to put her family first  she has no boundaries with them. To the point where her sister tried to get me to sleep with Me and I walked away. I didn’t know if I should say something because how she acts about her family. I told her a year later and She didn’t believe me and sides with her sister that I misread her intentions.  She has also allowed her family to disrespect me and not stood up for me or put them in check.  I’ve tried to let go of what drama and chaos her family as caused us but I feel it’s her fault for not setting boundaries. Her family is toxic they all and I mean all cheat on there SO. Me and her family have cut ties but it’s a big problem for her. She has done many things in the time span of our relationship. Lying, talking to other guys, to changing guys numbers on her phone with women’s names guys she had one night stands with before our relationship. She’s been caught lying after she promises not to. I’m so deeply in love but with her but her upbringing, her family has influenced her to act this way. We were friends for years became best friends and when I separated from my ex our relationship started off casual and ended up here. She says she’s in love with me and doesn’t want to brake up but it seems like everyday she fucks up. Everyone I know tells me I shouldnt be with her but I can’t see myself with out her. I’ve tried braking up with her but somehow she uses my feelings for her to get back together. My question is with her being pregnant should I still be with her?   There are many more things she has done to me deceitful things, horrible things but she never holds herself accountable I try but it never seems to sink in. It seems she’s only sorry after she does something wrong and gets caught. I don’t want to put everything out because I don’t know if friends or family will figure it out.  I am in no way an angel I get angry. But I feel because the past always come back up or she does the same thing over and over again and I can’t have time to move on or let go of it.

t3_chiln0,My (34M) wife (33F) may possibly have postpartum depression and I don't know how to recover after arguments,"My wife (33F) and I (34M) just had a baby 2 months ago.  I had a terrible dad who went full shut in and lived hoarder style when I was 14 and I had swore to myself I would never become him and I would be a great dad.  This kid is amazing and I would do anything for the kid.  My wife has been working super hard for the kid.  She wakes up in the day time and middle of the night to feed him, does a ton of research to properly take care of him and just really loves him.

&amp;#x200B;

With the good comes the bad, and the bad arrived in the form of grandmothers.  My wife's mom is from another country and she is super traditional.  She walked into my house the first day she landed and she literally set down her luggage and immediately started cleaning and cooking.  The entire time she kept complaining about how dirty we are and how we need to get rid of our dog because he sheds.  Additionally, she made complaints about how she believed I was lazy, how I needed to go do yard work and even questioned my finances if I would be able to take care of my son.  Mind you I have a damn good job and a damn good savings account and I've been the sole funder of her daughter for the past 5 years because my wife had difficulty holding down a job.  She wanted exact numbers and sent my wife to extract them from me.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is very loyal to her, even when they were separated by a ocean, they would try to call eachother everyday.  I can't fault a daughter for loving her mother, but her mother treats her daughter as the only valuable commodity in her life.  She tells her how great she is, she never does anything wrong, how her goal in life is to just to cook for her and  take care of her.  From what I can tell, my wife isn't really too keen on these ideas, as she purposefully left home at a young age to get away from her and has told me she doesn't want her mom to live with us but she doesn't have a solution to keep her mom from loneliness (her husband passed away 8 years ago).

&amp;#x200B;

I feel bad for her, I do, but I hate her so much.  I didn't know I would hate her until my son was born but her intentions became painfully obvious to me.  When my mom asked to hold my son for the first time, my mother in law demanded she take off all these clothing items before she would hand him over.  Everytime my wife and I get into some argument, her mom would rush into the room and ask her daughter if she is ok, she would walk into my room whenever she wants without knocking, even the small stuff pisses me off, she would take my son onto my balcony and start singing super loud with all my neighbors at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, after all this, I decided to just say hello to her mother and goodbye to her mother and keep it there.  I don't want a close relationship and I don't really care to know her.  I even told my wife this and she had agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently however my wife's personality has changed.  She seems to be on great terms with her mom and on a hateful relationship with me.  My wife would just start bringing up past issues and we would just fight.

In this last one, she got angry at me for not treating her mother better and kept demanding answers about how I should go about fixing the relationship.  Admittedly, I don't respond well to others getting angry at me, and I ultimately got angry as well and I told her maybe she should go marry someone her mother can bully around.  She went super Sayan mode and blasted me for what she interpreted as me calling for a divorce and also that I called her mom a bully.  I left angrily, and she responded by calling up my mom and going on a rant about how terrible her son is.

As you can see it all went down this super crazy angry rabbit hole.  In the end I sent her a email, I told her I'm sorry I got angry but I don't respond well to anger, its something I'm working on improving and I told her that her mom is manipulating her by telling her how I'm mistreating her mom and ultimately I told her how she needs to choose between her mother's happiness in her stay here or this marriage, its painfully obvious we can't have both.  Her reply went to the affect of ""Don't ask me to choose, you won't like my answer"".

So here we are, we haven't talked in a week.  I've plummeted myself into my work and tried to take care of my son when I can, but because of this argument, I haven't as much as I should.  Her mom and her in the meantime seem to be having the time of their lives taking care of my son.

&amp;#x200B;

She's been filling out these postpartum depression surveys every time we go to a pediatric appointment for my son and she always tells them she is depressed.  However in the past she would tell me she is lying on these surveys.  So I need some advice.  I don't know how to get out of this rabbit hole and I don't know what my future is now.   

I know I'm a flawed individual, I'm not stupid I can see it.  But my wife is always picking fights with me and with this last one I'm at a loss because I simply don't see how I would be happy having her mother living in our house but at the same time I love my wife and son very much.",relationship_advice

t3_chen06,GF (19F) lied to me (25M) about hanging out with my twin brother.,"I've been with my gf for about 1.5 months. She has known my twin brother and I for a few months, she knew him first before me.

She made the first move, so I believed she likes me more than him.

I found out yesterday that she and him have been talking alot, including flirting. They've been talking every day, and sometimes throughout the night til 4am. She tells him a the private details of our and my life. It's to the point where he knows more than I do about her.

A few weeks ago, there was a specific weekend where I was suspicious that she wasn't being open to me about talking with him. We had an argument, and she promised me she didn't talk to him at all in the past few days. Since that, I felt guilty for not trusting her and trusted her completely after that. However, I found out that they not only talked alot, but also watched a movie together during that weekend. She not only lied directly to me, she made me feel like the bad guy.

There are many many more lies, and the deeper I'm digging, the worse it's getting. 

After I found out she's been lying the whole time, she said she will keep all promises, but she still kept lying. I asked if she messaged him after I told her I found out and she said no, but she did. I asked her about this dinner, and she admitted she was with him, and there were other people there as well,but it was just the two of them.

I don't believe there is any physcial cheating, but I believe the lies are too extreme. She says she is sorry, and she won't do it ever again. She says this was a just for fun and just a fling. 

My brother, who has a gf, says he didn't think anything of it, that they were just close friends. He admits it escalated a little and is sorry about it. He knew everything that they did was being hidden from me.

I’m uneasy...","Title says most. I’ve(m32)been a wreck since and I’ve changed so much because of that relationship. Loved her(F26) completely and she loved me. I sucked quite bad at age at time and held a emotional only connection of deep love with my ex before her. I was cheating emotionally which is sometimes worse. But she was 21 at time and got drunk with a flirty coworker at work party while we were in a rough patch. I forgave her enough but never having an actual conversation about all of it in these years, I realize I just buried it. 

Now years later I’m the best man for my best friend, her sisters fiance. I introduced them and convinced him to go for it and knew she liked me. And then met little sister and we dated for over 2 years while they dated. She hated me til we broke up. 

I just don’t know how I feel now that the date is getting closer. I was not the best person with her but at same time I didn’t deserve what happened. She could have ended it and I wouldn’t have had to walk in on something like that. No one should. It’s one thing to find out someone cheated and another to catch someone in act. If asked I’ll gladly tell how.

We’ve talked on phone a couple times, but last time we saw each other was about 2 years ago and it was intense as f***! So much left unsettled as we immaturely just left each other without an actual conversation.

Do I try and have a conversation with her before the wedding? I know she’s been with someone else since but they split a few months ago and she moved home to where wedding is being held. Now I stupidly feel that since I’m single I should go alone and possibly have a moment with her. Foolish though.

t3_chov6i,"My ex [23F] and I [24F] are trying to keep a friendship after a 2 year relationship. Should I tell her that I’ve been seeing someone casually [25F] to maintain honesty, or not tell her at all?","I know this is a complicated explanation, but let me try.

I was dating my now ex for 2 years. We recently realized that we fell out of love with each other. No arguments or issues, just a realization that this wasn’t “it”, that it wasn’t sustainable to be just satisfied with each other. We decided to end the relationship and transition into a friendship, which made sense. We always got along and neither of us have a large social circle, so we decided to try.

During all of this, one of my newer friends of about 6 months, was helping me deal with this all. Being my support through this. (She never pushed me to a decision, in fact, I clearly remember asking her why she wouldn’t just tell me what she thinks I should do). A week or so after the break up was official, we went out to a bar and we ended up hooking up. Since then, we’ve been regularly hooking up casually, as she’s moving to a different state for a job in a few months. 

I know my fwb thinks I should tell my ex. She’s asked me about if I was going to tell her or not, and those kind of questions. I also know my ex wouldn’t handle that information well. When we were discussing the logistics of staying friends, she made it clear that she wasn’t sure she could handle hearing about/seeing me with someone else. And I absolutely get that mindset. But at the same time, we’re not together anymore, right? 

This issues has caused some tension with my fwb over having guilt about being “the other woman”, and I feel kinda guilty about hiding this from my ex/now friend. But I also know that if I told my ex, that that would be that, and we wouldn’t have any sort of relationship at all. And I’m stuck deciding if I should just keep it low for a while until my fwb leaves and the situation solves itself, or tell my ex and be honest with her.

t3_chor3o,FWB zoned,"I (26M) broke up with my ex (30F) over a year ago after being together just under a year. We weren’t fighting or anything. No reason to hate each other. One of those awful, difficult to articulate breakups where I didn’t want to hurt her by being critical but I was over the relationship.

I suck at breaking up. I’ve never been dumped, always been the dumper. When I knew the relationship wasn’t going anywhere, I became distant. Started smoking weed while I hung out with her (she doesn’t smoke but it’s always been a before bed routine for me, I turn into a vegetable if I do it during awake hours). She caught on to my bullshit but didn’t say anything, hoping I’d come around. Through a really unfortunate miscommunication (my fault) I very rudely and very accidentally broke up with her in a shitty way. Cancelled plans to go to a wedding (my family) in her home town. She was excited about it. Her dog died the same day. Long story. I suck. We both got over it eventually.

We didn’t talk for probably 4 or 5 months after my extremely shitty breakup technique was employed. But about 6 months ago we started talking again. She’s one of my best friends. Probably my best friend. I’m kind of a shitty person in a lot of ways and so are my friends. She’s a really wholesome person. Good natured. Very unique. Was dealt a shitty hand in life but legitimately makes the most of it with a smile on her face. 

Should also mention I started my business about a year before we first started dating. She was there when I quit my regular job and went full time with it. I have to work 7 days a week while I grow my business. It’s life or death for me because I refuse to go work for the man again. Things are going good but it takes 100% of my energy to do it. She helped me with a lot of the marketing stuff and still does. She also works for me once in a while for extra cash to supplement her disability income and part time job while she’s in school. I pay her very well.

So after we started talking again, we started hanging out sometimes. Then we started hooking up casually. We talked about it and agreed to FWB and nothing serious. I said on more than one occasion that I knew she wanted more and every time she brushed it off with “I can do better than you.” I don’t believe that’s how she feels. She goes on dates once in a while which I’m totally cool with but she doesn’t give it up that easy. She’s on birth control and we never used any other protection so we agreed to tell each other if we hooked up with someone else.

After the initial breakup I had a couple rebound hookups but I’ve been way too busy to really play the dating game. Just isn’t a priority at this point in my life. She had a couple brief relationships but hasn’t made any serious connections.

We went out with some of my old friends a while ago and she told my buddy’s gf that we’re exclusive FWB. I don’t really agree with that terminology because it implies a certain amount of commitment. Right?

So now I’m caught in this situation where I feel like I should be seeing other people to get out of this rut but I also don’t want to hurt her. I frequently blow her off because I don’t have the time or energy to drive 40 minutes to hang out. She’s my best friend. I just don’t want to be in a serious relationship with her. Lots of reasons that I’ve never taken the time to articulate because I really don’t believe in criticizing someone that tries as hard as she does.

She’s attractive but I’m not attracted to her. I don’t want to pursue a long term relationship. I love her as a friend. I want to be supportive. I want to be a great friend to her. She’s a great friend to me.

Not sure what to do with myself. I feel like me getting into another relationship would hurt her a lot because the only reasoning I’ve actually given her for not wanting to be in a relationship is that I’m too busy for a relationship. I’m scared of ending up with another girl and being questioned on my relationship with this ex. Sounds like a messy situation when I think about it.

I feel like some outside advice would maybe help me navigate these waters. I don’t want to spend the prime of my life in an exclusive non-relationship but I also don’t want to hurt my best friend. Help me.",relationship_advice

t3_chop0s,How to take back my baby photo albums that my my mom made away from my dad?,"20F here, I’ll quickly go over my parents divorce. My mother was in an abusive relationship with my father. At the time we were living in Colombia. My dad would never treat her with respect, she would physically and verbally abuse her. The last straw was when she found out he was having an affair with a 15 year old. 

My mother moved to Brooklyn NY when I was 3yr old and my brother was 1yr. My mother immediately started to work 2 jobs. Enrolled in community college to learn english, all while being a single mom. I  can’t complain about my childhood in Brooklyn at all. My mom was always there, taking us to parks, tucking us into bed every night.. my brother and I are truly grateful. Fast forward a few years, she got her citizenship and ever since that, our lives have just gotten better. 

At one point we started visiting my father in Colombia during Christmas vacations. He has 2 kids with the women he was having an affair with. Which makes this even more complicated and awful. My brother and I will never forgive her for what she did to my family. But it takes two go tango... Let’s just say my dad isn’t the nicest and he’s always saying my mom “stole” is from him. He is always blaming her, and never once has he taken responsibility for his actions, and is just permanently pissed about the consequences that came after. My brother and I go back because he is our dad, and we believe it’s the right thing. Even though we don’t really enjoy coming here. 

When my brother and I lived in Colombia my mom made us 5-6 photo albums. All these photos were taken by her. There’s also a folder with all my artwork, and many of my moms old school work. Last time I came to Colombia 2 years ago I asked my dad if my brother and I could take these home back to the states and he said absolutely not. He claimed this was the only thing he has left of us. 

My dad has never been present in our lives, he is too busy taking care of this other children. He never calls us, never supports us financially, and when we try to call him, he rarely answers. We are just not his priority. This is why my brother and I are so confused on why he  is so attached to our photo albums my mom made for us. He said “this is the only thing I left from you guys ever since your mom stoke you guys away from me”. 

So fast forward 2yrs. I’m in Colombia visiting my father with my brother. We searched through millions of binders and papers and then we hit the jackpot. We found all of my moms baby albums she made for us. We both really want to keep them. Now i’m terrified of comforting my dad, my brother and I both are. Now this is my question reddit, how do we take back our photo albums? We could try just asking him, but we know the answer will be no... Any ideas on what we should do? Thank you for reading.

t3_chm8cr,Bf (19) said this girl was more attractive than me (17f) while arguing? Is he still into her?,"Here's the whole story. 

There's this girl he told me he had a crush on for all of high school. He liked her properly for the last year of highschool until she gave some guy head in a hookup and he was devastated. 

A guy called her names and talked about being sexual with her really crudely and he tried to drown this guy. 

Around the same time as meeting me, he mentioned in a comment online asking if hes ever had an unhealthy crush, and a whole year after graduating says ""he needs to get over it someday"".

He tells me at the start of our relationship  he still talks to some girl hes known for a while. Who I suspect was this girl because he mentioned messaging her. 

He told me he blocked her off social media but I found him liking stuff on her insta while we were dating, when he had told me he had blocked her and she deleted all of her social media anyways.  He expressed to me that guys always like people's stuff with intention, it's not just a careless like. 

I confronted him and be said he was drunk and his friends had liked it, not him. Sounds kinda bs to me.

One time in an argument he lost it and said she was more attractive than me and her t*ts were bigger than mine. He's also expressed her being cute, mentioned he used to think her ass was nice. 

He calls her names sometimes when I get upset but it feels so forced and he once later  mentioned ""I called blah blah A *** FOR You""

t3_chon4k,Help! Need to stop thinking about this situation. Cheated on and cant move forward,"Hi Guys

&amp;#x200B;

Im in a dilemma... cant really figure out my own thinking reasons in this! id be grateful for any help/advice on what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

So back in january I (34F), was approached by a guy (27M) who works at the restaurant I went for a dinner. He asked for my number and not long after that we went on our first date.... things went really well... and we met up for a second date... by this point all we had done was meet up for talks.. and kissed by the 2nd date.

&amp;#x200B;

We had arranged a third date and just before this I receive a text from him late at night saying that he didnt think we should meet up, that he wasnt over an ex who he just broke up with 4 weeks ago ( I hadnt asked him during our dates any exs so this was the first time i was hearing of her). He told me at this point that they had been together for  6 months and things ended suddenly and he wasnt over her. We had agreed not to continue seeing each other and I went about my business.

&amp;#x200B;

Few days later I receive a message from him asking how i was and saying that we should meet and talk. I stupidly agreed to and at this point he said he didnt want to let me go and wanted to make a try of things. To which I agreed on the agreement that he had thought about everything and was 100% sure.

&amp;#x200B;

We started dating, seeing each other more... the whole time we were together I felt he never really gave himself to me 100% but  I carried on as I didnt want to pressurise him and thought we should just take it slow. We spent a lot of time together and I fell for him. I realised about 2 months in that we hadnt had the 'what are we conversation' and I felt like I didnt know where I stood. I asked him and he said he wanted to see where things were going and he wanted to continue seeing me.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple of weeks after this I notice that he stops arranging to meet me and the time between us seeing each other lengthens. He comes up with excuses of not to see me. when i confront him about these excuses he would say that he was telling the truth and they were genuine reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one evening before we are to meet he messages saying that hes not feeling the same way I do about him and that he doesnt think we should keep seeing each other. That he is still struggling to get over his ex! this is after 3 months of us dating. We arrange to meet to talk about things ... when we met he didnt want to talk about the message he had sent me and just wanted to continue as normal. saying it would be too strange not to have me in his life.

&amp;#x200B;

Time goes on and his excuses continue, he begins to talk more and more about how he is struggling with his ex. We meet and decide that hes not emotionally available for a relationship and that we should go on a break til he is ready and also healed from his past relationship and give him time to work on his underlying issues. He is a guy who has gone from relationship to relationship over the past couple of years not really had a gap... quite depressed at time, erratic thinking etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So the night after we decide to talk a break, it comes up on my instagram feed that he has liked a picture of some girl... I check her instagram and see a picture of the two them... I confront him and ask who this is to which he says it was a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day he calls me and says that he doesnt see any relationship potential with me and him and that we should end things. I ask him at the point whether he is seeing anyone as Im now getting paranoid because of the picture I saw. He says then that he is seeing two girls . Just at dating stage. I was heart broken.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway at that point my world is crashing down, i was so upset.  I didnt believe him that the girl id seen him in a picture with was just a friend so I stalked her instagram page. About a week later she posts a video on her instastory with them away and it is clear that they are in a relationship. At this point im devastated. I confront him about it

&amp;#x200B;

So it turns out that he was seeing this girl the same time as me (for a month before we decided to go on our break) and they are still together and now boyfriend and girlfriend. He mustve made up the story about the two other girls to distract me. 

&amp;#x200B;

We met up and spoke about things about two weeks ago as I needed some closure and he didnt understand why I was so upset as we didnt have an official title as boyfriend and girlfriend, trying to discredit everything! He also strangely said that he is still not over his ex and also revealed at this point they were actually engaged! he said he didnt really feel a relationship with me after 3 weeks of dating but couldnt bring himself to end things with me as there was something within me he didnt want to crush. If he had told me they were engaged i wouldnt have got involved with him. I felt hurt that he couldnt just be honest with me and tell me he didnt want me. There were times when I did want to walk away but hed always have a way of pulling me back in.

I found it strange that he is still in love with his ex, but has a new girlfriend! he couldnt answer me this when I asked him.

&amp;#x200B;

Its been two months now since I found out about the new girlfriend, BUT  I keep stalking his new girlfriends page and seeing them getting along with things and  in a relationship. Her insta page is public so I can check it whenevr.  I really want to stop checking her page but cant seem to control it. i havent contacted him and havent heard from, we did agree to be friends but I dont think its a good idea. I feel so hurt by him, I thought he wasnt capable of having a relationship because he wasnt over his ex, but he seems to be having a fine one with his new girl and still in love with his ex.  Can I even say he cheated on me when we were  not officially in a relationship??",relationship_advice

&amp;#x200B;

Me (25 F) and my special someone (28 M) are so in love together, we have 5 months dating and it's almost always very well. But we pass the week away from each other so, we have to talk online and that's my problem here. He never treats me well like in person, almost never even responds in a good way. I don't know how to deal with that because I like him so much, I'm afraid to be abusive or too demanding with him. I'm his first gf, so I really don't know how to act.",relationship_advice
t3_chon0y,Whats the deal with this 'work wife' or 'work husband' scenario in offices ?,"**TL;DR - What are the rules of work wife/husband culture in offices ?**

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently switched from night shift work to day shift work. I am a (33/M, married with one daughter) doctor in a hospital. Naturally, I get to interact with wayyyy more people on a daily basis. So a couple of female staff (nurses / assistants) have been more chatty with me than others. 

The conversations sometimes include the words - you know I like you, or, Whats up love muffin, or, did i tell you today that I love you , or , honey bunny, or, you are such a sweetheart, etc, in between patient care related conversations. Most of the females are late 20's to early 40's females, (presumably in relationships with kids). So i casually showed it to my buddy and he said - dude, you havent realized it yet, she is your work wife !! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am not from America and this whole concept is new to me, virtually non existent in my country and prior jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very careful while responding to such written text messages and tend to be as professional and as platonic as possible while replying to the messages, but sometimes during face to face conversations, I might respond with - you know I love you too, or, the liking is mutual. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I wanted to know if there are any unspoken rules regarding such a behavior. Whats the limit ? Whats a hard stop ? 

My wife is somewhat aware of this when I have shown her a few texts and she is always like - you better be careful with this thing. But she isnt aware of every conversation and every text that happens and honestly, I dont see a point of telling her. I rarely communicate with them outside of work hours, except for may be one or two times when I have asked them how they are doing if they had a bad day.

t3_chomcu,Girlfriends family is torn apart due to religious reasons,"This is probably not my business to try and help, but what kind of boyfriend would I be if I didn't try right? 

Backstory: My girlfriend was born because her mother had been raped by someone she knew, but he fell of the face of the Earth, so my girlfriend has no clue who her real father is. While they were homeless, they met the man who is now my GFs step dad. Theres been problems with that, but the main problem lays within the Mothers side of the family.

To be straight forward, my gfs Mother is an atheist, but the rest of her family are these looney JW's (Jehovah's Witnesses). They do shit like abuse, molest children of the family, but on the surface they make it look like they're a loving happy black american family. My GF is scared of her cousins life, and she called me in a frantic frenzy explaining the situation and how she can't really help even though he wants to. From what I hear, her cousin is 19 and has traumatic experiences and depression due to his treatment in his family. One half of him wants to believe in JW but mainly because he wants to remain in his family (apparently when you stop being a JW, JWs are not allowed to speak with non believers). The cousin still lives with his dead beat racist Father (ironic because he's black) and is always preaching how blacks are bad yadiyada. Their grandmother is the worst of the worst too, she abuses the kids, taking it 10 levels too far yet still calls it ""discipline"" (load of shit). One the other half of the brothers mind, he wants out of being a JW, but he's too scared to leave even though he is 19. My GF and GFs Mother loves their cousin(s) but GFs Mom has been pretty much banned from the family. They spread lies about her and tarnish her name. It's a bizzare situation that I had no words of reassurance for, I think reddit might be able to help. I appreciate it in advance. Sorry for grammar mistakes.

TL:DR; GFs cousin is stuck living with Jehovah's Witness family members who treat it like a cult (even though it really is), but she thinks theres nothing she can do to help.

t3_chombq,Is my relationship with my mother worth saving?,"I have never been very close with my mother. Never have I ever really seen her as a maternal figure or trusted her with personal information. I moved out right after high school and have been trying to get off family plans as well. As soon as I could, I removed my mothers access to my medical information.

Here’s some information about my mother.  When she was very young, I wanna say about 7, her mother passed away from breast cancer. I think since then she used it to define herself and figured people would only be friends with her if they felt bad for her. In some ways I think my mother is a narcissist, but not a particularly malicious one? She makes every situation about her regardless of how little she is involved. My mother can also be manipulative, often times for no reason at all. (Ex. Inviting me over for dinner and then when I make the two hour trip there no one is home and she texts me asking to put her mulch down)To make matters worse, when I was around 8 and then 11, her two sisters passed away from breast cancer as well. The gene skipped my mother so luckily I don’t have it either. 

She completely lost it after that, my dad threatened to divorce her, she told me she had thoughts of hurting me and my sister, etc. But the thing that got to me the most was her way of grieving. She would talk about her sisters to anyone who would listen. It sort of seemed like she was exploiting their deaths for attention and I feel like she disrespected my aunts in that way. Around this time I started developing mental issues of my own. (Suicidal thoughts, dissociating, self harm) When I reached out to my mother, she constantly one upped me and ignored my own issues. I started reaching out to other people and fell into a cycle of abuse, mainly sexual and emotional. I felt like I could never tell my mother cause she would use it to make herself into a martyr for “saving me.” It escalated for years until I was violently raped by a boyfriend. I moved out of her house a few months after and immediately saw an improvement in my mental state. Since then I have found a wonderful partner who is incredibly supportive and we live together about two hours from where I grew up. 

The main issue now is that my mother continues to try to take advantage of me. She has always been demanding and has often times wasted my time and money. I’m being forced to go on vacation this fall because otherwise I would be “ruining the family.”  She demands that I drop everything and drive 2 hours home to do stupid menial tasks for her yet has not once made an effort to see me at my home. I haven’t gotten one yet this year but as long as I’ve been working she’s been emailing me Christmas lists of things she wants, mostly expensive things that she knows I can’t afford.

I’ve considered going no contact but it’s hard to justify since there was no real abuse? I’ve just never really felt like she was a mom to me. I don’t like who she is as a person but I don’t want to lose contact with my whole family by cutting her off. I can’t ever see myself being close with someone who will post Facebook statuses about “how great her daughter is and how much she loves me” while ignoring my texts and calls for weeks. She’s not entirely responsible for my mental issues but I do think being around her a lot makes it more difficult for me. Basically I just want to know how to set appropriate boundaries without causing any drama within my family.",relationship_advice

I used his iPad today to call my misplaced phone when a message popped up from a college friend of his. “You always ignore me.”

I tried to ignore that but....**seriously???** I scrolled back through messages and saw that they’ve texted on and off since October of last year. Sometimes about work stuff (they have the same job in different states), sometimes politics, sometimes them. 

When it’s them, it’s her pouring out her heart and saying that she loves him and he’s stupid for not seeing her interest in college. She keeps saying “the timing isn’t right but we’ll be together one day” and “I want you to fight for me for once and pick me for once.”

She knows I exist AND that we are planning to get married. Which pisses me off that she would have the audacity to share any of that when she knows he’s with someone. 

My boyfriend never returns the sentiment. The closest he says is that he took her on one date back in college and she didn’t talk to him for weeks afterward so he assumed she wasn’t interested and moved on. 

I wouldn’t be mad about this except she visited our city a few weeks ago for work and he took her to dinner one night when I was out with friends and never told me. He actually straight up lied because he told me just a few days ago “X was here and I gave her recommendations for sight-seeing” and I asked if he’d seen her in person and he said no. I took him at his word and didn’t ask more because: honesty. 

The thing that makes me most angry is that he lied to me. If it was just dinner with a college friend, why would he feel the need to lie? Which makes me believe something more happened between them. Which breaks my heart and would absolutely mean the end of our relationship. He probably knows this and it could be part of why he didn’t tell me.

I am afraid to confront him about this. I snooped, which is just as dishonest. What do I do?

If nothing truly happened then is it overbearing of me to say I don’t think she should be in his life anymore? Social media, texting, etc? I never wanted to be THAT girlfriend and I would never want my boyfriend limiting who I can or cannot talk to. However, I don’t have a past romantic interest bearing their soul to me while knowing I’m in a committed relationship and then continually allowing that to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend's family is from the USSR. He was born in Russia, moved to Canada and then at 14 moved to the US. His family are intellectuals - father is a healthcare executive and mother an antiques expert and has a brother who is a rising star chef at Michelin restaurants. His family speaks English almost without accents and are the most generous people you've ever met. They are, however, Republicans. Not Trump Republicans, but Mitt Romney/John McCain/GHW Bush-style Republicans. My boyfriend, who is a widower (bike accident) took full advantage of his parent's demands that he become educated and they fully supported him through university and then dental school. He gives back through volunteering his time at clinics for the poor and does free advanced dental work (he's a specialized dental surgeon) for people who simply couldn't afford the work. All-in-all, his family is great, his brother makes me delicious food when I see him (he recipe tests on me and each time I can't really help discern what's better because it's all delicious) and my boyfriend is exactly what I've always wanted in a partner. He's kind, he's smart, interesting and very supportive. I couldn't be happier. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, my parents, who are longtime community college professors, hate him. They're out-and-out Democrats and have trouble associating with people that don't reflect that. My friends, many of whom are people or color or immigrants, also cannot stand that he's openly a Republican. What bothers them is that they think he should *know better* and are shocked that someone who went to dental school would also vote for someone like Romney. It's that my boyfriend is a massive capitalist and loves what he sees as being the ""freedom"" of America. He's more American than anyone I know, and between his looks and accent, you wouldn't know he wasn't born here (he was even given a very anglicized first name at birth). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm caught between two groups. I was engaged before to a man that looked down on me and used me as his maid. I cleaned for him, cooked for him, took care of his financial matters and in return, he was critical and cold and getting his peepee played with by the woman up the street. I dated but nothing ever worked. I was worried it was never going to work for me, I thought I was doomed to be alone. Then I met ""Fred"" (not his real name) and suddenly I found a partner. We both want kids, we both want the same things in life and even have similar tastes in where we want to live/what we see as a division of labor. Things keep clicking for us. It's been 6 months and I could easily see myself being with him for the rest of our lives. Things aren't perfect - he can often come home from work emotionally drained and consequently will toss dirty clothes on the floor and spill food, but if that's our biggest ""issue"" then I am not at all worried. Yes we disagree on politics but we also agree on a lot of other things, like how we want a marriage to work and how we feel people should be treated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm happy but my whole world around me is *unhappy*. My parents are making it increasingly obvious they won't support us being together and friends have very openly told me that they're shocked that an immigrant, a dentist and an educated person could openly support that party and questioned our friendship. I don't agree with his politics, but I love him. I feel like I'm being told that it's them or him and I'm fundamentally greedy and want people to get along so I can have family + friends AND Fred.

t3_choi0m,Are my parents nosy?,"(Using a throwaway account for privacy)

&amp;#x200B;

I (27 M) recently got married to (let's call her) ABC (25F) and live in a country different from where both of us grew up and where our parents live.

&amp;#x200B;

Very often when I am on a phone call with my parents, something happens, which makes me very uncomfortable. I feel my parents checking quite often with me if I am happy in my marriage with ABC. I have never shared any marital woes with my parents (well, I have not even had any real problem to be worried about), and their repeated checking makes me cringe a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, ABC and I went on a week long vacation, and both my mom and dad independently checked with me, if I was happy in the vacation. If my wife was nice to me and treated me well. My only response was, ""Yes, of course! Why do you ask!"" and their usual answer is ""Oh, just to be sure that you are doing well. It only makes us happy to be sure that you are doing fine"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet another time, over a casual phone call, my wife told my mother about a grand meal that she cooked for me as a surprise. And again, my mother told me over the next phone call, that she heard about the grand meal and why I did not share that ABC gave me a surprise. She added, knowing that ABC throws such surprises etc. only makes them happy for their son!

&amp;#x200B;

I have spoken with them saying that they being doubtful about my happiness makes me cringe. But they only say that they want to be sure about it. And again - it makes them happy to know that I am doing well!

From a certain perspective, I do understand, that they want me to share my happiness with them. At the same time, I am not sure, if they are too doubtful about my happiness.

t3_chm3uc,Coping with separation. (18M),"Hi everyone. I posted a while back asking whether or not I should cut the cord with the girl who dumped me. I’ve decided to take everyone’s advice and do it. This is because she just makes me feel way too many emotions, and it’s inappropriate for her to text me while she’s in a new relationship. I’m having a hard time with ignoring her replies. It makes me almost as sad as the breakup made me feel because I’m so emotionally empathetic. I would be so upset if someone cut contact with me out of the blue and because of that, it hurts for me to be that someone. 
This is all amplified by the fact that I still have feelings for her deep down, no matter how perturbed I sound. It’s even FURTHER amplified by her being one of the most beautiful people I’ve met in my life. I’ve never been attracted to another person the same way. 
A bottle of redpills later and I realize that she clearly took me for granted (even if we were in love), and I deserve to be with someone who will reciprocate my feelings instead of acting as an emotional deposit box. I shouldn’t settle to be some keychain boyfriend. This is an internal battle that’s really ravaging my body right now. 
I have an anxiety disorder, so my head has a tendency to sicken the rest of my body. This emotional conflict negatively effects my sleep, willpower, character, and pretty much my entire well being as a human. What are some measures I can take to manage these symptoms, and not relapse on this “drug” of mine? Will I ever be able to have a friendship/relationship with her again?

t3_chohlm,"I'm [31M] and in a 9 year relationship with [28F], having feelings for best friend [29F].","I'll cut to the chase and say I have **NOT** cheated. At least not physically. My best friend of the past 4 or so years is another woman. My girlfriend has not had any issue with this, because we set boundaries and rules and made everything crystal clear.

The best friend and I never do anything ""date-y"" together, we avoid anything intimate entirely, even if we're watching something like Netflix (which is rare) we never get ""cuddly"" or anything like that, and my girlfriend is almost always around. I wanted her to have piece of mind. I'm proud to have never cheated and remained loyal, and for many years with best friend it truly was a non-issue.

The problem is, the more time passes, and the more I hang out with best friend, the more I realize that she's more compatible than the woman I've been with all this time. At least besides sex, obviously, because I refuse to cross that line.

The friend and I have a deep caring for each other, that definitely goes beyond just ""friends"". We chat near daily and have similar hobbies, and if either of us gets busy or won't be around for a prolonged period of time we always let each other know that we're safe, etc. Not sure if platonic is the correct word here, but yeah.

For awhile the ""strong feelings"" I had I always assumed is what it'd feel like to have a sister. I don't have one, but I never felt a strong sexual attraction, more of just a caring of her ""well being"".

Unfortunately, the past few months I've been noticing some sexual tension and have distanced myself a bit in fear or anything happening. But when I do this, I just feel like shit and only think about her more and more.

Things with my GF honestly are not too bad. We do have a lot in common, she has been there with me through hell and back, and honestly she's the breadwinner in this relationship. I only make 45-50K, while she's making 80-85K. She never cared that we had this type of gap, and willingly took on more of the bills.

The only issue GF and I have, is... Well, you guessed it, the bedroom department. She didn't have much experience before me, is very vanilla, and won't entertain my fetishes at all, even though they're very tame. I tried compromise, I've tried sitting her down, but overall our libidos and sexual ""degeneracy"" are just complete opposite, and it's wearing me down.

The fucked up part, is since my best friend is opposite gender and we share a lot of personal things, I found out that best friend is into a lot of the same things I am. Not just hobbies, but kinks and whatnot. I tried with every fiber of my being to ignore this, but ultimately it's making things worse.

The other HUGE issue, is best friend cannot work. If you ask why in the comments I'm not going to reply to that specifically. The only thing I'll say is she's unable to for legitimate reasons. While I don't mind having a more traditional-style relationship and her being potential ""stay at home wife"", it's pretty much financially impossible living in a major city on 50K, so we'd have to move, and how am I supposed to make a leap of faith like that without knowing if we're going to be sexually compatible? 

I already feel like a complete asshole having these feelings, but I don't know what else to do. Move away from best friend and work things out with girlfriend and accept that we're a good match in most areas outside sex? Take the leap of faith on best friend since we mesh better, but cannot split bills and risk other unknown factors since we've never been sexual together?

t3_chm32g,Should I confess my feelings or not?,"Hi everyone, so I got to know this girl through okcupid and at that time she just broke up with her bf about 2 months ago, she told me the bf lost feelings for her. We texted on a daily basis and went out a lot and i started developing feelings for her. 3 months after knowing her, somewhere along the way i was under the impression that she had feelings for me. We just click so well, had lots of heart to heart talks and i was there for her when shes feeling down, so i confessed (i did it through text which was stupid i know).

However, i was wrong and she didn't feel the same about me in that way, she told me she still misses her ex and ever since then we stop texting daily. We remain good friends to this day.

Months past, I went on a few okc/tinder dates here and there but i still cant get over her, it was at that point that i realize my feelings for her is real and that i'm truly in love with her.

Soon after, I found out that she got back with her ex. We recently met up, to catch up on things and she admitted that she felt the relationship won't last.

So right now I'm caught in a dilemma. Part of me really wants to tell her how i truly feel about her face to face, mainly because i don't want to have the regret of not confessing my feelings when i have the chance and tbh idk if i can deal with the regret, another reason is that if they did break up again i hope she sees that I really meant what i confessed to her. But part of me is afraid that i'll ruin this friendship and that we'll never talk if i were to confess my feelings, i mean what do i have to lose if i were to confess right? Should i confess or should I let be and try again to move on? I've been contemplating about this for quite a long time.

He apologized and said that he didn't think it that way and it won't happen again, he says that they never meet again, even so he continues to like all her pictures on ig... 

Next thing was, a few weeks ago, he posted a photo shirtless, and she made a really slutty comment...

&amp;#x200B;

So my girlfriend dumped me about two weeks ago. Her reason wasn't anything I did but more to do with her sexuality, so thankfully, we both still want to be friends. The first week I was was very sad, I still am a little bit. But this past week I've become more and more thankful we broke up.

 Now, don't get me wrong I love her, more than just in terms of a romantic relationship, in general I value her as a person a lot. I've known her for about three years and she's one of my best friends, but the more I think about it the more I realize she was far better to me as my best friend than she was my girlfriend. This was about a six-seven month relationship, so relatively not long, but we still both consider it both our first serious relationship. 

 Some of the things she said to me were very hurtful, and messed with me. I let her know these things were hurtful, I just should have been more honest with just how much they hurt me. I should have seen the red flags when they showed themselves.                                                          
Most of the time she was an awesome girlfriend, we did the standard cutesy teenage relationship stuff, and we would go to all of eachothers' performances etc. etc. But sometimes she wasn't so awesome, it didn't happen a lot but it still did happen.

 So the first toxic thing, the seemingly smallest one, but one that still hurt was that she's told me about 3-4 times about how much she doesn't trust me. Now, I understand that some people have trust issues, and that's fine, but it still hurt every time she said it. 

Secondly; the thing that really messed with me the most, that I really should have drawn a line at, was when we were having a conversation about cheating and how we both agreed cheating was trashy and we'd never cheat on eachother. I can't remember exactly what was said leading up but to it but despite how much we didn't want to cheat on each other basically she said ""The pool of people I could cheat on you with is bigger than yours.""

This was a huge fucking kick to the gut. It hurt. It hurt a LOT. I wish I told her exactly how much, but all I said was ""What you said hurt."" and that's it.  

We'll fast forward to about two weeks ago. She's over at my house, we have a fire, I felt the time was right so we kiss for the first time (we've been dating long distance for a while, the summer is the only time we're in the same area.) She kept saying how awkward it was, I didn't have much of a problem with it, because it WAS awkward but I guess according to my friends this is an asshole move on her part? She calls and breaks up with me the next morning. 

Yesterday I finally texted her to ask if she wanted to hang out. We make plans for today. I want to talk to her about our relationship in general, and where to go from here. And I don't think i'd feel right without talking to her about the hurtful  shit she said to me. So, my question is, how do I bring all this up to her? How do I tell my best friend that she hurt me that much? I don't want to be mean, or rude about it but I still don't want to make it seem like I wasn't that hurt.  Any other observations about me or this relationship are welcome. I wouldn't be surprised if i'm just overreacting.

Sorry for the book I wrote about some stupid seven-ish month teenage relationship.

We broke up two weeks ago, and after a week and a half i feel i'm ready to talk again. We're meeting later today and I want to talk to her about the hurtful shit she's told me.

t3_chofyc,I feel like my best friend/ex lover doesn’t care about me anymore,"So recently my best friend who I was planning to move to and marry next summer recently started dating someone else, he said the reason was because of the distance and the fact that I was planning to do a dangerous job which I understood completely. I was fine with him seeing someone else because he was still my best friend and he still meant a lot to me. But it seems like whenever we would talk or do anything he would go hours without responding or blow stuff off  we were supposed to do, before he started dating we would almost talk every second of every day,and whenever I would tell him how I felt it seems like he didn’t care, and when we did talk it just felt like he was talking to me out of pity or obligation because he said he was my best friend and I meant a lot to him. We’ve known each other and been really close since high school, and maybe it’s because I’m in this dark place where I overthink but even though he said he did love and care about me the more I think the more I start to feel that he never did at all, like he would never just tell me he loved me out of the blue like I would to him. He never once mentioned my career choice which I would’ve happily changed to if it meant we got to be together and the second this person asked him out he said yes to her.

t3_chofus,[32M] fiance (33F) and mother conflict over elopement and my handling of it,"Hi folks - I would really love to get everyones perspective on this situation. My fiance and have been together over 7 years and are planning on getting married in September. We've gone back and forth over time over the wedding. She didnt really want one and wanted to elope, but we had been entertaining the idea of doing a very small, possibly immediate family only ceremony. I should note that both my fiance and I have some fairly serious social anxiety, so lots of people and entertaining and the whole wedding package was never our way.

Long story short after much debate, we decide to elope just the two of us. My mother is very disappointed and let us know that early and often, which created a whole extra layer of tension. We also have a puppy who hasnt been gone from us much since we got him when he was very little and rarely take trips.

Her family paid for the trip to elope and are fine with it, and we asked my mother if as her wedding present to us, she would come stay at our place and take care of the dog while we are gone. She initially indicated she would be okay with that, but then a few weeks ago said she couldnt do it - couldnt get off work (part time craft store she works at for enjoyment and not for income), wpuld feel really sad and lonely staying at our place while we are off getting married (we live on other ends of the country).

My fiance is very upset that she backed out and that she wouldnt do this for us, and more so that she said she would and didnt say a ything to the contrary for three months while we were planning our trip.

I tried talking to my mother about it and express our disappointment, and she said something again about how she was going to be sad and disappointed she couldnt be there. I told her I didnt want to hear anymore anout her disappointment, thay I was really excited and she needed to be happy for me and thay everytime she talked about her disappointment it was robbing us of some of the joy and excitement.

I also told her that it felt like she didnt want to help us because she was upset about the wedding and elopement. She said it was not the case, that if my fiance or I were sick or if we needed her to take care of the baby she would quit her job if she couldnt get the time off. Which we somewhat interpret as saying our dog, which is very nuch our baby, and supporting us for our marriage isnt important enough.

In any event, I hate conflict. I am terrible at it and my fiance tells me I always let people, a d especially my fanily, walk all over me. So my fiance thinks I let my mother off the hook by not being madder or more forceful, but I just dont know what to say when she is apologizing and I have told her how disappointed we are and frustrated that she didnt tell us sooner so we could have been making other arrangements.

So my fiance tells me yestersay that she wants to stop communicsting with my mother until after the wedding (2 months) ecause she keeps sapping the joy from it, and I said I wasnt comfortable with that. Now I am the one in trouble, the fiance is talking about how she isnt sure she wants to marry into a family with someone like my mother (manipulative mainly) and how my mother never liked her (she did ask me once if I was settling, which yeah kind of fucked up).

I wholeheartedly agree that we need to establish some boundaries with my mother and curtail her meddling in our relationship, but I didnt feel a two month time out was the ride path. But my fiance views it as I forgave my mother too easily. I love this girl and desperately want to marry her, but now shes talking about the whole two week trip and wedding being ruined and she isnt sure she wants to marry me now.

Apologies for length, but lots of backstory to be had. So what of it relationship experts? I would love some insight as I am at a loss for the right thing to do.

Tldr: fiance is talking cancelling wedding and elopement due to my mothers meddling and my poor handling of the situation.",relationship_advice
t3_chkz53,How soon is too soon to say the “L” word? (21m 22f),"Been dating this girl for over a month and things are going really well, the sex is great, our personalities click really well, we’ve been exclusive for like 4 weeks and “boyfriend and girlfriend” for 2 weeks now, have plans to meet the parents, etc.

One one hand, she says she doesn’t consider anything under 3months to be “serious” and, although her Tinder has been deactivated (not deleted) since we started going out, she’s admitted she still checks it once and a while.

But on the other hand, she’s said she feels “attached” to me already, she always says she misses me when we don’t see eachother for a while, I’m her phone lock screen, she has printed photos of us together up in her room, she’s borderline said it already a few times but not outright the full “I L Y” yet.

**TL;DR**

t3_choazf,"Good relationship but a thing in the past bothers me, don't know if I can carry on.","I (30m) met a wonderful girl some months ago (26f) and we are currently dating (4 months). I've been single for quite some years after my last relationship but this girl hit the right notes.

Anyways, the first contact I had with this girl was two years ago. We met her at a club and one of my best buddies made out with her. They then went on a couple dates and that's all, because she wanted something serious and my buddy didn't.

After a couple years or so she added me on Instagram, we started to talk randomly, we went on a date blabla. Everything seems good from the outside.

However, the last few days I kinda feel upset at her. I can't help but think 'this relationship exists only because my friend basically turned her down. ' she totally ignored me that first night and now she is all over me - I don't know, but a part of me probably thinks that is not genuine and I am some sort of crutch. Obviously I wasn't hot enough for her - but now I suddenly am. Meh.

t3_chkxx5,How am I supposed to talk to my shitty roommate about her disgusting/annoying/inconsiderate actions without being an asshole about it?,"It’s long, lots of detail, I’d like some advice. TLDR at the bottom

Hi, so I’ve posted quite a bit on reddit asking for advice on how to deal with my roomate. Nothings really been working and that’s partially been my fault due to poor communication skills. I’ve already decided that I’m moving out October 1st when the lease it up, but I’d like some advice on how to not be completely miserable for the next 2 months and maybe not burn down the bridge with her after I leave. 

Some background: 
I’ve (20F) been living with my step sister (18F), who I didn’t grow up with, since April. I’ll refer to her as S. I was already living with another roommate but her mom was moving out of state and S asked me if I wanted to get an apartment with her. I agreed even after she said her boyfriend, A, would be moving in to. They had been dating for like 2 years and I met him a few times and he seemed cool. Week one I discovered that S had been sleeping with 2 other guys at our apartment while A was at work. I kept that secret for her a month until A came home early and found S in the bedroom with some other dude. a beat the fuck out of the  dude and I thought he would move out and that’d be it. That unfortunately was not it. The next day I go to pay rent and A wants to go with me, I’m like “oh fuck”, and we’re driving there and he asked me what’s been going on. Apparently S convinced A that the dude was just a friend and A needed to hear that from me I guess. I told him the truth because I felt so bad and honestly thought he deserved better. They break up, he moves out, and S says she can’t afford the master bedroom and wants to switch with me. So now I’m paying more rent than I wanted to. The inconsistency is just beginning. 

After A left I learned that me and him did the majority of the cleaning because HOLY FUCK did our apartment just suddenly get way dirtier. She would throw acid and moly parties and not clean up the garbage and mess for 2 days. She leaves dishes in the sink even though we agreed to put them in the dishwasher. She wont scrub the dishes and just let the food get stuck on and wonders why nothings clean. She honestly hasn’t taken out the fucking garbage once since we moved here even though her parking spot is the closest spot to the dumpster. She has the guest bathroom and it’s too embarrassing to let people use it that I just let them use the one in the master because I keep it clean. She has the grosses room I’ve ever seen, I don’t really care too much about this as it’s her own personal space, but if I clean the house within a day the common areas look just like her room. She never vacuums. She smokes a pack a day and hasn’t thrown away any cigarettes from the patio so there all just sitting there. I don’t go on the patio, even tho I’d like to, because she’s turned out there into her storage area. There’s all her boxes and a bag of stuffed animals that’s she didn’t want to throw away. This stuff irritates me to no end and I’ve talked to her about her mess numerous times. All she told me was that she’s a “kid” and “doesn’t know any better”. I told her that she’s a fucking adult not a kid and needs to act like it. Part of being an adult is cleaning up after yourself so your roommate doesn’t have to. 

For a solid month there was either a new tinder dude or like 5 of her friends in our apartment. She wouldn’t give me a heads up sometimes and I’d come home and want to relax and I can’t. One of these friends was my old roommates gf who I very much disliked for many reasons and expressed this disliking for to S asking her not to invite her for,but she decided that she was “in love” with this girl and they started “dating”
for like 2 weeks. This girl eventually got evicted and banned from our entire apartment complex because she tripped the fuck up on acid and banged on 3 of our neighbors doors at 2am telling them to get out of “her house”. Fun times. 

One time I wanted to have my little brothers over, one is 10 and one is 5. I put it on the calendar and told her a week and a day in advance. I asked her to take down the pictures she drew of naked women, hide her bong and rig and put her playboys away. Sleepover day came and she didn’t. I ended up rushing to clean up everything before my step mom, not related to S, came to check the place out. S also decided to invite over 6 of her friends that I’ve never met, one of which brought a big ass pit bull and didn’t tell me. It ran into my room and made me jump but scared tf out of my 5 year old brother. They also were smoking weed in the house. I asked her to stop and she told me “it’s not that big of a deal”. 

About a month ago S and A started seeing each other again. I really didn’t mind I just thought it was weird to be around them considering that I was the one who told the truth to him. So I started staying in my room whenever he was over. But then he started being over EVERY FUCKING DAY. I asked S if A and her were back together and she told me no..? I asked if he was moving back in she told me no...? Why is he over everyday and why are you fucking and still going out? Then that day I got home from the beach with my gf. S isn’t there, I start cleaning. 2 hours later I go to put her beach towels she let me borrow and wash back in her room and went to give back the towels. I open the door and A is just chillin in bed. I also noticed that my missing sheets were on her bed, again, after I told her not to.  I throw the towels on the bed, say sorry, walk out. I text S asking her why she has my sheets, I don’t like the idea of my sheets that I’m sleeping in being the same ones that you’ve fucked multiple dudes on, and why is A here. She said she’d wash the sheets and then played the victim saying I give her anxiety every time I text her about something and that she cant feel comfortable in her own home. I told her the only time I text her is to let her know that she left the back door wide open again even tho the AC is on or that she left all the lights on and left the house again. And I told her that I don’t have a problem with A being here, I’m just not comfortable with him being here when you’re not home. I thought that was reasonable enough. I thought wrong apparently because she hasn’t talked to me since then. I’ve said a few things to her about my social worker coming over or me not gonna be home but she has not initiated a conversation. A has been over every day. And true house is fucking disgusting again So I’m basically trapped in my room because I’m just not comfortable with the mess. I’m not good with confrontation, but I’m fucking angry. I don’t want to hate her because we’re basically family, but I’ve come to resent the hell out of her. She’s a horrible person who can’t even take care of herself. I don’t want to be confined to my room anymore, I have people over and not walk into a messy cluttered house. I don’t even know what to do anymore but I can’t live how I’ve been living the past month for the next two months. What should I do? Any advice is appreciated. 

TLDR; my awful roomate/step sister got back with the bf she cheated on, who I told she was cheating and he’s over everyday. She literally never cleans the house and it’s gotten to the point where I’m basically confined in my room. I’m moving out in October but I don’t want to live like this for the next 2 months.",relationship_advice
t3_choa6k,Need help getting over a terrible ex,"I dated my ex for 10 months and the relationship was awful. However I am still hung up on her and I have no idea why. If she asked me back today I would date her in a heartbeat.

Here are the issues:

I broke up with her 10 months ago.

She was a huge liar, very hypocritical, and an all around shady person.

We shared absolutely no ""special"" moments. In those 10 months I only met her brother once and 2 friends. 

I caught her in more lies than I care to remember, and she would gas light me constantly.

She was a huge hypocrite. She would nag and nag about any females on my social media and essentially demanded I delete any girl I've had any history with. After several months of this I looked at her social media and all but 1 guy from her past that I was aware of was still on her social media.

I walked away from the relationship with lasting damage. I met her at a gym where I've trained for years. She had been training there less than a year. She threatened me often that if I broke up with her she would quit and tell the owner's of the gym it was because of me. I called her bluff and she did. The messed up thing is the owner's wife believed her and I was the one who got kicked out!

She went 3 months without contacting me and then we talked for 3 months. She created a fake Snapchat, Instagram and email just to talk to me. She claimed she feared I would screenshot our convos and use them against her. However I caught her being shady again and asked her not to contact me again.

She conducted me a month later on my birthday and I ignored her. A few weeks after that she contacted me asking for help. When I responded she ignored me. The next day she claimed she was sick and none of her friends would help. She proceeded to send me relationship memes, but when I bit she rejected me and I told her to stop contacting me.

There is so much more. She is an awful person. She's very dishonest and while I never caught her cheating I wouldn't put it past her.

I found her very attractive, but she didn't seem to receive much male attention. She is 35 and has never been married and has no kids. Our 10 month joke of a relationship was the 4th longest relationship she's ever had.

When I was alone with her she was very sweet and has a great personality. I think we only argued once when we were together in person.

What's bothering me is this girl is awful. She would be an awful girlfriend and has no loyalty at all. She's self centered and fits the definition of sociopath perfectly.

So why am I stuck on her and what can I do to move on?",relationship_advice
t3_cho9w6,"If your FWB disrespected your boundaries, how would you handle it?","If your FWB disrespected your boundaries, would you be done with it? Or, they don't really owe you anything? 

Me and mine (mid-30s) hook up once a week and have an agreement that if either of us are sleeping with someone else pretty regularly, we tell each other.

t3_cho7mg,Having LDR Troubles with my (M21) GF (F21),"Hey, sorry in advance for a long ish post.  My GF (let’s call her Anna) and I have been dating for about 2 years.  We started dating in the summer between freshman and sophomore years of college.  We agreed to stay exclusive at college and until about now, everything’s been fine.  We see each other about 1-2 weekends out of the month and we live 4hrs apart.

She is absolutely wonderful.  She’s caring, beautiful, loyal, and funny.  But I’m growing concerned for the future.  I am very career driven, working full time and have secured a position at a company I really love, effective after I graduate.  She has no idea what she wants to do after college (she graduates at the end of this Spring) and doesn’t know if she’ll be able to find work in my city.  She doesn’t seem to care much, she’s spending the summer working very few hours part-time and enjoying vacations etc.

I’ve tried talking to her about it over text but it’s difficult.  She kinda shuts down and gets stressed out over it.  I love this woman to death but I’m scared of investing another year or two into an LDR that may not end for a long time.  I’ve been entertaining the thought of a breakup but our anniversary is this weekend, and we have a vacation planned for mid-August.  I really don’t know what to do here.

t3_chlww4,How to get my wife to be more active in bed?,"I'm 35M, and my wife 34F is somewhat passive in bed. It is always me who initiates sex. I suggested that I would like her to initiate from time to time, but that never happened.

When I ask her what she would like to do in bed I don't really get an answer. Along the lines ""Typical is fine"" is what I get.

She seems to be content with our sex life. She always comes - sometimes actually too fast if we had a few week break, which frustrates her. The next day is however always better.

Since she has little preference, both positive and negative, I can squeeze in some variance from time to time. A ""slip of the tongue"" while going down on her a year ago showed that she enjoys some anal play - and I enjoy it very much too. When I slipped a finger in during sex  she orgasmed great. I asked if I didn't go too far, she said no.

I almost feel bad about complaining that my wife let's me do whatever I want to her, but damn, if she just said ""have sex with me"" I would instantly come buckets. I just want her to want something... Always being the one to initialize, to warm her up and lead is frustrating.

t3_cho6gk,"Does it sound like my boyfriend of almost a year, hasn’t even wanted to be in this relationship all along?","Reposting because I couldn’t sleep last night and posted really late, so hardly received any responses...
I was trying to give this relationship some time. I found out he grew up in a somewhat abusive household where his parents were not very loving and affection was never shown to him. I thought as our relationship progressed, he would be able to express it more
We will be together a year in September. Both have children, about an hour distance from each other so in the beginning, it went very slow due to the time restraints, distance, work schedule, custodial schedule, etc. and saw each other once a week. The VERBAL affection, and I capitalize that because that’s something I’m not getting, and is important to me, was present. Maybe the first month, three stopped, then I got a little bit of it in month 3. And it wasn’t a lot to begin with. I would get a text here and there with a sweet emoji, a “good morning beautiful”, “good night, sweet dreams”, “I can’t wait to see you”... just a sweet text that didn’t take a whole lot of effort but meant so much. Nowadays, I get NOTHING. Absolutely fucking nothing, unless I say something first then he reciprocates.
Here are the positives though- and they’re pretty big. We spend 2-3 overnight visits together, the kids have all been introduced recently so we get to spend that time together. He’s met my parents and other family members (I haven’t met his parents because he doesn’t get along with them). But besides his kids, I've met his grandparents. He also seems to be putting a lot more effort in terms of spending whatever free time he has, with me. Which is big because he’s a workaholic and works long hours. And also very important- when we are together alone, he’s very affectionate. Still not verbally, he could very well be a robot. But physically. He holds me, kisses me, rubs my back, just makes me feel desired at least. We don’t go out often because we are homebodies, but when we do, he just doesn’t go out of his way to even hold me hand.
I’ve talked to him, yes it may have been a while ago, but I don’t want to bring it up again because I don’t want to seem like a nag. I’ve brought up that I wish I would hear from him more because that was a major issue for me. And he’s made the effort the past couple months. I just don’t want to come out and say “hey I’d love if you would say sweet things to me” it just sounds silly.
I thought maybe it was just his upbringing and have been willing to overlook that and deal with it because he is truly a wonderful guy otherwise. But nope. He’s certainly capable because he calls his daughter “baby” all the time, holds her hand just when they’re sitting watching her iPad, comes up to her and just holds her. Now I want to be straight that I don’t expect that level to be the same with me because I have kids too and show so much love towards them. But I’m only using that as an example to state that the guy isn’t incapable. He is, but he just never ever calls me baby. He calls me by my first name. He never goes for my hand to hold it. When we’re standing around, he doesn’t just come up to me to hold me by my waist. It’s just my last boyfriends have had no problem doing it, yet he does so it makes me wonder if he even desires me.
Like I said, when we’re sitting on the couch or laying in bed watching TV, he’ll put his arm around me, hold me, kiss me, motion to have me lay my head on my chest but he fucking sucks otherwise. He can’t even call me babe, and it’s so natural for me that I just call him that while he calls me by my first name that it sounds so much like a friend or a business associate.
Does this sound like a guy who might just be with me out of convenience and really doesn’t care or want to be in a relationship?

t3_cho5rw,My crush might have a crush on me.,"So it all started during the second year of my post graduation. I met her when we were interning at the same company and we became instant besties.
She had a bf at that time and I didn't have any feelings for her. She felt comfortable telling me everything even the things between her and her bf.
Past 10 months , after several hours of calls and immeasurable chats. It was farewell time. And suddenly it dawns upon me I might never see her again since I might be moving to a different city for job. At that moment I realise I have feelings for her. But I shut my mouth thinking no this is not right she has a bf(actually a really decent guy)
And it will be unfair to ask her.
So I did the unthinkable. I started ignoring her. Not replying her calls  quickly , ignoring texts.
Believe me I was suffering and she was wondering what she did wrong.
So I finally got some guts to call her. I tried to stay out of topic until she said "" Do you love me or something?"".
I said "" Something like that I might have feelings for you""."" But give me some time and I will get over them. All I need is some alone time"".
She said Ok. But tried to convince me to not to.
Finally we agreed that I will block her now and unblock her once I don't feel anything for her.
It's been a year now and I finally don't have any feelings for her. Over this last year, she tried to reach me multiple times through my friend. She even msgd me on LinkedIn the only social media account I didn't expect her to reach me.
Yesterday I got a notification about someone viewing my profile. It was her! Now I wonder if she has feelings for me too all this time.

We both are looking to the future now, but we have arguments regarding things such as her wanting to pursue life drawings, and such and also how to raise kids, she doesn’t want them to be religious at all but I would like to them to be religious and live by rules and such, but she sees that there is no right or wrong so we just let them do what they want as it’s their lives. the major problem is that we disagree on is the future with a family, is this a deal breaker?  Any insight or advice concerning this matter would help, we are both different nationalities and religions and this could also be a clash from extended family perspective? I feel like if it was just the both of us with no one else there would be any issues, if that makes sense. she said the decision she wants to make is prob not to be together for long term even though it is the hardest one, but she is still thinking of compromising things etc how do I save this?

t3_cho574,Am I (23M) being an asshole by asking for the usual amount of love/affection from my GF(22F) who has a lot on her plate?,"Hello, I will try my best to describe exactly what’s going on.

Basically, my gf is working a summer camp job at her college for kids that come in internationally for the whole month. She’s sleeping in the dorms with then and practically spending everyday with the students. Plus on top of that, she is taking summer classes during the work week and she has an exam almost every week.

Lately things have been a bit rocky in our relationship only because the amount of affection and sex has dramatically decreased. 

I’ve talked to her about it and she says she is very stressed and it’s hard for her to think about it with all this stuff on her mind. I think that’s a completely fair point, on top of the fact that I don’t want to add more stress to her life right now.

But the thing is, she hardly thinks about that stuff at all. It’s like that part of the relationship is non-existent for her at the moment. 

I’m not asking for much. Honestly, just the same amount of love and affection we’ve had before, I’m okay with even less than that in fact.

But she barley tries and hasn’t really put any effort in it at all. I’ve talked to her about it and she only gets upset and doesn’t think she’s good or doing enough. I don’t want to talk to her about it anymore because I feel like it’ll just go down the same path...

I told him that I’ll stop suggesting stuff to do since sleeping at my room and doing nothing is way more fun and he replied with “ok”. 

He started to tell me that he wants to do stuff with friends because of drugs. That made me upset and he said “I guess it is more boring with you than my friends”. I’ve told him many times that I’m worried he’s not having fun with me and well then he said “no, I have fun with you too” but turns out he was lying all the time

FYI, I’m really insecure and I’m scared I’m boring and this just makes me miserable and lately my depression has become worse so I don’t know what to do and how to continue the dialogue",relationship_advice
t3_chiuao,Why don’t I feel right about this boyfriend?,"Got into a relationship about 4 months ago. He’s a good person and treats me better than any other boyfriend has. There are no red flags and he is great in bed.

One issue I can’t stop thinking about though is how I usually show my love through physical touch, whereas he constantly showers me with verbal affection. However, instead of being the confidence boost i imagined, since all my past boyfriends have been more physical as well, it’s actually making me uncomfortable. I always feel like I have to say things back and when he says them to begin with I almost don’t believe it, it happens so often.

We also live about a forty-minute drive away and I’m used to living with my partner even early on as that usually keeps things more interesting. I feel like the less often I see him the more I’m questioning this relationship. I just don’t want to give him up because he didn’t do anything wrong, and I love spending time with him in general.

t3_chlsgk,"I [24F] am having a hard time adjusting ""love languages"" with my [25M] boyfriend","I've been in an exclusive relationship with this guy for 2 months, and even though we're both introverted he really enjoys his alone time more than I do (he told me this).  

Since I've been busy with other comitments I haven't been able to see him for a couple of weeks, and usually if this were another relationship I would be messaging my boyfriend everyday. The problem I'm having is that when I message him to chat about anything, he gives 1 sentence replies and generally seems to end the convo early.  

 Words are a love language for me, so I really enjoy chatting with and messaging my romantic partners.
Conversely, When we do meet up, my boyfriend prefers to do a lot of cuddling and feeling (outside of sex) which I am also into but is not an essential thing for me.  


This is really difficult because I don't want to sound like I'm clingy or can't respect his need for solitude, however I do feel like I'm not given enough attention.  

Is this feeling justified? Do you think we are just incompatible in a fundamental way or are there methods to accommodate for our differences?

t3_chkqmd,Girlfriend isn't sure if she we are meant to be together following significant life events that have apparently changed her. Needs space to figure out how she is feeling.,"Me (m24) and my girlfriend (f22) of 2.5 years are going through some dark days at the moment. I first found out that days were dark when she told me she wasn't feeling any excitement in our relationship anymore and was often seeing me more as a friend. she also doesn't know if we will work long term because of our different interests. A couple of weeks later she tells me feels like a different person after her abusive father died (months ago) and so isn't afraid of the world anymore, she wants to go out at night more and be more involved in the cities art scene. She is an artist herself but her father was also one and she wasn't completely comfortable with artists as people because of that, and was afraid of running in to him at art openings where he once creepily took photos of her from afar. She didn't grow up with him but he abused her and her mother when she was very young, eventually they escaped the situation.

  
Another painful element in this predicament is she has now developed feelings for her best friend (m) who went to art school with her. I have never had a problem with her having a male best friend and was happy she was able to feel comfortable around him and talk about art. They both are part of a studio at a gallery so see each other pretty often, on two occasions they have both stayed the night there together on a fold-out couch. She says they didn't do anything intimate (I do believe her) but this could be considered a form of cheating considering she has feelings for him and did it more than once. I'm not sure whether she really wants to go out with him or not, it sounds as though she just wants to be single and have time to herself. She thinks he has feelings for her too. One time he told her that he was going on a date and she started crying in front of him.  
Currently, she wants a bit of space to figure out how she is feeling.. and has basically friend zoned me for the past 4 days. She is also housesitting up the road and staying alone there. We still are getting along for the most part and watched a movie together today, but there was no kiss.  
I have spent several nights on my own crying, and have been upset around her a few times too. I'm finding this really hard and don't know if the situation is unfair on me. I still care about her and want her to be happy, ideally with me (if she can figure out if that will make her happy or not....)  
This is also both of our first relationships so I have never been in a break up before. We also live in a flat with four others and two of them are her friends from art school.

  
I feel really fucked up/depressed and don't know what to do. Currently just waiting to see how things develop with her and between us.",relationship_advice
t3_chadni,"Over the last year my [34M] wife [36F] has had a drastic personality shift. We went from being geeky dorks, to her basically wanting nothing to do with it. She keeps telling me nothing is wrong and tastes change, and that she loves me. But it just feels akward.","Me \[34M\] and my wife \[36F\] have been married for 8 years, but have been together for 12 of them. We met through World of Warcraft, and ended up falling in love and getting married. We currently have two wonderful twin daughters who recently turned 6 years old.

Before this we have always been geeks, she got me into Dungeons and Dragons, and i got her into Warhammer. We have done everything from cosplay to other things. Never once did i ever feel like i was pressuring her into doing things. Geeky hobbies aside we both have always been fairly active.

About a year ago she basically started making regular excuses for not doing our D&amp;D night, then it turned into her basically telling me she isn't having fun and doesn't want to go. Then she decided to put all her hobby modeling stuff into storage. We haven't played video games together in months now, before we would do things like play video games next to each other. Now all she does is sit there and read/etc. 

On top of that it really feels like she is avoiding most of our friends. I have had numerous messages from some of her friends asking about her, and i don't have an answer. Instead of when we would get a babysitter and go out she just wants to stay in and basically do nothing. 

We still have sex regularly, and nothing has really changed at her work at all. It just feels like something is wrong with her, but she won't tell me.",relationship_advice
t3_chnunf,should i (18m) break up with my college gf (21m)?,"i’m in college and towards the end of my freshmen year met this amazing girl (21f) who really hit it off with but didn’t make official or make moves or anything 

for a month during the summer we talked and eventually started facetiming like every night for 2 hours at a time and got really close. eventually she visited me (2 hr plane) paid for hotel, stayed there w me and we ended up doing stuff. i asked her to be my gf the last night and thought she was the one.

for the last month now we’ve been doing long distance. i really thought everything was perfect, texting and calling, but then this week she’s in NY for work and has been super busy and tired. i was getting worried about the less calls and all day no responses so called her yesterday, i asked if i did anything wrong but she said no, then she suddenly started saying all these issues in our relationship like she doesn’t feel i know the real her and she doesn’t want me to depend on her and she’s been faking cute sometimes and is sick of me being cutesy sometimes 

today i was really sad and depressed. couldn’t really do much. is it my fault for wishing she texted back within the day? she posted on insta today of some stories of eating out with her work friends but didn’t reply to my text from morning. i got really sad and deleted all my social media. i’m taking this rlly hard because it’s my first real relationship and i don’t it to all go to shit because that’s what it’s starting to feel like 

i just think that no matter how busy i am i would at least text her because she’s that important to me. maybe i’m not to her. i’m thinking of asking her for a break until we see each other in person in a month at school. i’m just tired of drinking myself to sleep and tired of feeling lonely and insecure.

I have girl problems. I’ll call her Amy. Me and Amy met a year and a half ago, and have been close friends ever since. For the first few months of knowing each other, she had a huge crush on me but I didn’t want to be in a relationship with anyone, although I liked her back. 

We moved on with life getting closer and eventually becoming best friends. She stays over in my house a lot and we sleep in the same bed, but its never been weird, purely platonic. About two months ago we decided we were both physically attracted to each other so we became friends with benefits but didn’t date or become a couple or anything, just best friends having fun. 

Now, I know this is gonna sound selfish but stick with me. I’m ready to be in a relationship now and have started seeing her in a completely different light. I’m finding myself thinking about how cute she is or how much I wanna just hold her hand. Thoughts i’ve never had before. I confessed these feelings to her about two weeks ago and she told me straight up that she doesn’t feel like that anymore. She used to see me the same way I see her now. Ironic, I know. But bottom line is she doesn’t feel like this about me anymore. I was disappointed but it hasn’t really been bothering me. Until now. 

She told me yesterday about this guy in work that she really likes. Hearing that felt like a stab through the heart. I played it cool with her and still am, just joking around telling her to go for it and whatnot. She went on a date with him today and he told her he likes her. I’m almost sure they’re gonna start dating. I want her to be happy and i’m glad she is, but its so painful. I’ve been nonstop thinking about her and him all day. They keep popping up randomly in my head. The two of them together, cuddling, making out, even just lying with each other. I can’t fucking stand it. Its killing me and has been making me feel depressed even just doing regular stuff. 

Is there any way at all I might still have a shot with her? I know I sound selfish, I want her to be happy trust me, but I want to be happy too. It feels like all hope is lost now and I keep telling myself to just move on but I don’t WANT to move on. I just want her.

t3_chnt36,My [27M] girlfriend [26F] is being really inappropriate with another guy and I'm not sure how to handle it.,"# Feel free to skip to the giant 'ADVICE NEEDED STARTS HERE', this is just context

The following is just a bunch of background because I always see the OP needing to post a bunch more context in these kinds of threads so getting it out of the way first. We've been in a relationship for five years or so. It was monogamous at her insistence - sexual openness naturally makes sense to me, but I've dated plenty of monogamous people and I have no problem with it. I *like* exploring other people, but it's something I'm happy to forgo to be with someone who I love.     
    
 She wasn't in a great place at the start of the relationship due to coming from an abusive home, suffering childhood sexual abuse, a lot of bullying in school etc. None of that was her fault so I was fine with a lot of the early relationship being a bit uneven, requiring a good deal of financial and emotional support which made her feel pretty guilty - in her words she felt like a 2 dating a 10 who was making the 10 put all the work in. It was all worth it though, she didn't realise how amazing a person she was and all it took was time and support for her to start growing to become the person she wanted to be. You can't fix a person, but you can provide a loving space for them to fix themselves, and she can finally acknowledge that she's pretty and worthy of love, that she isn't stupid like her father beat into her, that wanting sex doesn't make her a bad person.     
    
I realise I'm making myself sound amazing here, but I've done some awful crap. She's right about the asymmetry of how much we give and take, but the rest is tosh, she is amazing. I was really bad with boundaries with other women as a result of the natural inclination towards polyamory, which is not an excuse when you've signed up for a monogamous relationship. At varying points I was in too regular contact with an ex girlfriend, who sent me a naked picture over Facebook. I told her not to send any more, but I also didn't tell my partner it happened. I went over to another girl's house who she was concerned about to watch avatar with after an argument about whether it was any good (which it is. Airbending is the coolest shit it turns out) and didn't tell her. I sent a bunch of sexual stuff to a bored and lonely friend, we were both aware it was fantasy meant to brighten things up for her and would never actually happen but was still far beyond the boundaries we'd set. There are probably more I'm not thinking of, and she'd have been well within her rights to break up with me over any of them, especially the last one, and I never thought to tell her about any of them until she found out for herself. Though she got incredibly angry, the fact that she knew it was me just not thinking about how it would affect her and engaging sexuality saved me each time since my intentions weren't actually to cheat - it's easy to avoid fucking someone, but I've found it hard to police myself regarding boundaries. Basically didn't break up with me because while it was inappropriate, I hadn't meant to hurt her - though I should have known it would.     
    
Each time that happened I reflected on and refocused my behaviour so the offenses got progressively less bad. Back to the relationship itself, sex was often a huge problem, I have a very high sex drive and there'd be weeks of nothing. Nonetheless as time went on, as she got happier and healthier and started gaining self esteem and respect, sex has gotten better and less spotty. Everything's gotten better - again, it needs to be restated I really love this woman and always knew things would be great once she was able to learn to be happy with herself.

A little while back she was clearly in a fairly bad place. Took me a while to tease what was wrong out of her, and it turned out she'd been having a bunch of sexual fantasies about a past boyfriend and felt incredibly guilty considering how incredibly rigid she'd been about monogamy and how the fact that I wanted other girls was fucked up and meant she wasn't enough for me, despite me explaining that it was a want not a need and one I was happy to put aside for someone I actually needed, her. As time has gone on she's stopped suppressing herself, has started to masturbate, initiate sex, explore her sexuality basically instead of trying to ignore it. So a bunch of desire she hadn't realised she had with and had no experience in dealing with, fixed it by sitting her down and having a good long talk about desires themselves being natural, and only a bad thing if acted on in the wrong way.     
    
We talked for a good long while, and she was really happy that she finally understood how I felt about sex with other people (as long as everyone's safe and happy, a positive experience and one that doesn't detract from your love for your partner) and we were both surprised to find out she shared it. We started discussing possibilities like threesomes and she shared that she'd actually quite like for instance to see me fucking another girl, that it would be pretty hot. I've not done anything yet - for one thing all my old partners in that respect have long moved on, and for another given how many year she spent breaking down at the thought of me being interested in anyone else I wanted to go slowly. Plus, again, it's a want not a need - I'm now open to exploring someone fun if they come along, but I won't try to force it. I also encouraged her to share her fantasies with me and get in contact with the ex boyfriend if she wanted to. Her biggest fantasy by far was a him/me/her threesome, which is the kind of thing I'm into though less so than B/G/G because it's not as hot, enjoy both though. Previously they'd only seen each other once a year enforcing PAX, and she started messaging him on Facebook after this.   
    
TLDR is so at this point she'd been furiously monogamous for years until having a change of heart and realising that sex wasn't a zero sum game, you can explore people without wanting your partner any less. Her sexuality just kind of activated - previously she only got horny in bursts, when she wasn't horny she couldn't really enter the mindset at all - didn't know what she was into because the sexual part of her just wasn't accessible, basically. It was a couple of months ago, and her having desire active in the background has been great, no more only playing with her breasts during sexual activity, it works for her all the time now. We discussed the obvious safety stuff etc and how it would work emotionally - I shouldn't go for a couple of girls I'd had a past emotional connection with, since a lot of kinds of emotional intimacy should be only between you and your partner. Works for me, since that's also my opinion. She'd be happy for me to bring a girl home and fuck her brains out so long as I told her I was doing so, but that shouldn't be instead of fucking my girlfriend and I should make it clear that it was just sex, my heart belonged to her. I'm super happy with all that, feels the same for me - happy for her to have fun and experience, and I understand why she doesn't want me to have a second girlfriend, even a less serious one, I feel the same way. Great to be on the same page - relationship as it was, but sex with others allowed to take place in parts nothing would otherwise be happening, not supplanting anything but adding to it.        

#ADVICE NEEDED STARTS HERE
     
It turns out despite the whole explore sex with other people if you want but keep your partner primary in your thoughts thing she's been doing all kinds of stuff that definitely crosses the line, and I don't understand why any of it. I resisted the urge to check her facebook and texts until recently, but I was always aware of the selfies she was sneaking off to take and got fed up with waiting for an explanation. The fantasies weren't a result of cheating or anything, she only started messaging him after we talked and I said go for it, but while she hasn't met him due to scheduling problems yet a lot of the shit they've been talking about is not ok. Despite the better sex, there have been a couple of extended dry patches due to physical issues - not her fault, even if she's aware she likes dick all the time instead of occasionally and at random she can't do much while ill. This was a huge issue early on, her basically forgetting her boyfriend had needs when she wasn't active, but less of a problem now when the sex is great around those points. But she's been taking all kinds of photos of herself topless, naked, aiming to look sexy etc - and only one has been sent to me. She knows we're in a dry spot (right now due to changing birth control) and that kind of thing would work for me - I'm all about intent, and I want to emotional closeness of 'I'm thinking of you even if I can't be physical in the way you'd like'. I'm fine with engaging sexuality, but doing so with someone else and *not* your partner is fucked up. There's also been a fair amount of sex roleplay, which is something we've never done - I've written stuff for her, but she's never felt able to find the words to do it back. Not happy seeing her writing out scenarios for him and not even mentioning the ability to do so with me.     
    
Now, there's been some reassuring stuff sent: 'And OwnPear, my partner, will be told a lot of what is going on, nothing specific and no messages will be shared but he will need to know what's going on' and 'I will not leave OwnPear, he has been there for so much and he means the world to me. Only his behaviour would break us up and that's unlikely. I know you have no plan to ask that but I kinda need to say it for my own mental health.'    
    
Now, onto the other stuff. Keep in mind she's continued sending him pictures she's been taking throughout this and doing stuff like masturbating to what he's sending, though matching the times up she's not doing so during the dry spells. 'Other Guy I have wanted you for 3 goddamn months, I am not averse to waiting but I don't want to wait for too long. I want to be able to call you my partner, my boyfriend, my lover, whatever title you choose'. I'm super not ok with that one - partner and boyfriend are completely beyond the pale. Same with 'Also I love how you are all about calling me your girlfriend until it becomes maybe an option'. Lastly there are a few hypocritical things - I like words like slut and whore in the moment but she has huge issues with them so I never use them. But...

HIM: I got really horny out of nowhere and I need two things. To swallow a load of some guys cum, and to fuck you like a whore

HER: mmm i can help with one of those things

HIM: Good, because I want to abuse you, to cum in and on you
I want to write all over you about how much of a whore you are and then I want to take photos

HER: as long as you are the only one to see those photos    
    
Now the meat of this is, what do I do? I fucked up in a similar way several times, but in each of those she was furious that I had been inappropriate without thinking about how it would affect her. I got over doing that by putting more effort into thinking about my actions and how they would affect her - but there is precisely zero chance she doesn't realise why the above listed stuff isn't ok. I tried to give her an opening to talk about it if she was just in too deep and feeling guilty earlier today, casually mentioning that I knew about her sneaking off to take naked selfies. When she didn't bite, I said that I just figured out why she was doing it, that her self esteem still wasn't good so she didn't want to share with me, pretending I thought she hadn't sent them to anyone. She said 'Yeah, I want to think I look good but then I don't'.    
   
I want to know the reasoning behind this. I can forgive a lot, for instance I could even forgive getting really carried away in the heady rush of feeling sexual and confident and saying a bunch of shit she *really* shouldn't have as long as she takes steps to fix it, but the bit that's worrying me is character. I didn't expect her to straight up lie to me about the selfie thing, and I'm worried she might have flaws of the unfixable kind. I'm not going to say anything for now, now that she knows I know a part of it I am going to wait a while and see if she comes to her senses and tells me. Her not knowing I know puts me in the position to be able to ascertain her motives, and if it turns out she's just not thinking and making a huge mistake she'll regret and she turns around and genuinely tries to make amends I'll forgive her - I'm not just going to confront her right away since my most burning question is why any of this, and any person in her position will paint their actions in the light their partner would find most acceptable. I've done wrong too before, wrongs of this specific nature in fact, though mine was always done genuinely not realising knowing would hurt her - though she was right in saying if I'd thought about it for five seconds I'd have realised, and that's just as bad. But in this instance it's not even a case of not thinking for five seconds, she can't possibly not be aware she shouldn't have said half the stuff and should have told me the other half.     
     
So it turns out I don't know her as well as I thought, and she could be several different people. She could be a hypocritical asshole in the center of her being, which can't be fixed. She could be barreling forward unthinking, enjoying herself too much to stop and think. Neither of those fully explains the above, and there are a ton of options - and her not knowing I know means I can effectively sift through them, like with the phone thing above. But this is not something I've done before, I'm unsure what things I could do or say that would further reveal her motivations. Again, I really love this woman, and I care about the truth here - she's fucked up badly here, but *why* she has will mean the difference between an angry fight and breaking up with her. Hell, I could even be overreacting, I'm a bit too close to the problem to see clearly. Any advice? Especially regarding what I can do to provoke her into revealing more of her motivations.",relationship_advice
t3_chnsvf,Is it unreasonable to ask you partner to remove a ring their ex gave them?,"For context, im the ex in this situation.
Im trying to see this from all sides but i understand my view is somewhat biased.

About a year ago i proposed with a ring to my recent ex after dating for 18 months knowing the likely answer would be no, but wanting to show my commitment to making it work.
When they said no i placed the ring on the right hand (so not the wedding finger), we hugged and that was that.
They are now dating someone new who knows i purchased the ring for them. The new partner has asked them to take the ring off.
I understand the reasoning behind wanting your partner to reduce ties to their ex but from my position;

1. They said no to the proposal
2. Its not on the wedding finger.
3. They have been wearing it for about a year before the new relationship.
4. The relationship is distant at best with the ex.
5. The ex is no threat.
6. You cant change the past.

Is it a reasonable thing to ask your partner to take off the ring?

Part two.
Being that it was origionally an engagement ring to which the answer was no and given the new circumstances, would it be unreasonable for the ex (me) to ask for the ring back if they are no longer going to wear it?


I know my views have some emotion behind them and being a bit upset that the ex would take the ring off. However me and the ex are over with no chance of getting back together, damage was done during the breakup by both parties that make even retaining a basic level of contact and conversation prooves tricky at times and a 12,000km distance now between us.
To be honest, i would like my ex to have the ring assuming they wear it, but if they choose not to wear it because of someone else i think it would have more meaning with me than sit in a draw for the rest of time.",relationship_advice

t3_cgx8ct,Update: I'm (24F) getting jealous and insecure about my boyfriend's (21M) interactions as a personal trainer,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c7tc1y/_/

It's been a while.. Thanks for everyone who weighed in last time. I did decide to confront him the next day. He was a bit annoyed but said he understood, and he would try to tone down their interactions. Though I didn't tell him about seeing their Instagram stories, and I kept checking them and exactly nothing changed.. He was still posing for pictures, arms around them or the girls touching him. I was really upset at this point and .didn't know what to do. Then about 2 weeks ago he came home after the gym and went straight to the shower. His phone kept blowing up so I decided to go through his conversations.. Yep bad move I know. But this way I did find out he has been going behind my back. A bunch of messages from one of those girls how much she enjoyed the workout, and when he could meet up for another 'private' session.. Confronted him once again and at first he denied it, and eventually it turned into 'just a blowjob'. Like that makes it any better.. I told him I wanted him out, and he said he was going to make things right and asked for a second chance. I (stupidly) gave in after lots of crying and talking. We were going to keep open communication and work on trust.. 

Well yesterday I got a message from a DIFFERENT girl saying she was sorry but that my bf had been cheating on me with her. She claims she didn't know I existed and they were seriously dating. She sent me screenshots and yeah I was done right then and there. Again told him he had to leave, and he kept denying it until I showed the screenshots. Then he told me he never stopped seeing the fitness slut.. Yay me.. Anyway he's gone now at least, though I feel so utterly betrayed and broken. I bought into all of his lies too, maybe I'm easy to fool. Obviously it was never just a bj either. Sooo yeah thanks for the advice last time. Seems like many of you were right. I was already not in a good mood the past few months but this has made it 10x worse. Just feeling broken, like something is wrong with me. That I got cheated on again just fucks me up.

t3_chnp6t,"I [27/M] have been on a few dates with a girl [23/F] who feels like she is out-of-my-league in the looks department, seems fully serious about me/us, but seems to not be all that smart? Don't know how to proceed.","Hello,

Some background first; I'm 27, work as a programmer, never had time for dating previously as I was always busy with computers and improving myself. Recently I've started online dating via multiple apps, not being very succesful. I'm passable average looking and have no previous relationship experience bar a long-distance one that lasted about a year (we never met in person, distance was too large). I really enjoy puns and other play-on-words and general sarcasm/dark humour, my hobbies are mostly just gaming.


I met the subject of my past couple of dates via an online dating app, purely on accident as I felt she ""was out of my league"", She is 23, absolutely gorgeous and she is completely my type in pretty much all physical aspects...  She works as a clothing in-store salesperson, I have zero issues with this and respect the work she does. Except that she seems to be lacking in the ""smarts"" department? I don't know how to say this politely, and I do not mean to offend her.


We've been on two dates total in the past couple of weeks, I initially asked her out after talking for a bit, we have pretty much nothing in common, but I felt like I could use the experience for future dates since I'm not that socially experienced.


1\. The first was just dinner at a small restaurant. She asked if she could bring her friend because we still were mostly strangers at that point, I agreed.  The friend stayed for about 10-15 minutes, before they both stood up asking for a minute, they spoke in the corner enthusiastically, the friend left while giving me a thumbs up. We spoke during dinner, it was okay-ish except again, we have nothing in common whatsoever. She listens to R&amp;B and Rap, I'm more of a Metal person, etc..  We shared the bill, and she seemed to have trouble paying half until I mentioned the exact amount she had to pay, she looked at me like I was some sort of genius for figuring it out so quickly.  When we left, she attempted to kiss me, but I blocked her with a finger in panic, she looked disappointed but did not insist and instead grabbed my arm and asked me to walk her to her car, which I did.


We spoke a little bit in the next couple of days, but I was busy with work and at one point forgot to reply to her. After a week, she contacted me again, I apologised, she then proceeded to ask me out on a movie date.


2\. We went to see the movie, she immediately hugged me when I arrived, pretty much never let go of my hand/arm even in the theater. It was pretty fun, all things considered. When the movie ended, I walked her to her car, she handed me a small box as a gift which she insisted I should accept. Her car then wouldn't start, I couldn't discern what was the issue in the dark and offered to drive her home, she got her bags and everything and I drove her to her place. I helped carrying her stuff inside, she asked if I wanted to drink something, etc.. We spoke a bit sitting in the sofa, she asked me if I wanted to open the box she got me, I opened it up, it contained a fitted shirt from the store she works at and it doesn't look cheap. She asked if I could try it on, and to not disappoint her enthusiasm I did. (It fit perfectly, though I don't know how she got the right size without asking or measuring) She grabbed me by the collar and kissed me, I was caught completely by surprise but I don't think I'll forget this kiss anytime soon- She wanted to go further, but I declined and made excuses that I still needed to walk my dog, she gasped and near literally pushed me out the door saying that I shouldn't make the poor boy wait.


When I got home, she had sent me a message, saying she had a really good time, and asked if I could drive her back to her car the day after so the garage could tow it. she told me that she appreciates me being her ""gantlumon"".. I thought she made a Pokemon related joke (me being a gamer, and all), but it seems to be how she thinks gentleman is spelled. I did drive her the day after, and waited for the truck to arrive, the entire time she was very touchy and giggly and casually mentioned how she has removed all the apps she doesn't ""need"" anymore. She also installed Steam on her laptop and got some of my favourite games (that she asked, and I told her about during the dates) to play together ""sometime soon"".



I somewhat like spending time with her, sometimes it's really great and fun, but then other times it's quite awkward. It often feels more like a parent-child, or older brother relationship since I've often got to explain things, or help her out. It kinda feels like I'm dealing with my toddler niece at times..? 
Whenever I say a pun, she looks as if she's seen a ghost or has the expression of a fish that has been laying on dry ground for a week, making me explain the entire premise of the comment before she laughs and says I'm silly and/or funny. Sometimes making me explain the same one multiple times at different intervals. She doesn't seem to ""get"" sarcasm, so I've been trying to avoid it.


I like her enthusiasm when it comes to her hobbies, and she really becomes lively and entertaining, and she always listens attentively even if it feels like half of what I say doesn't stick. I don't want to let her down and ruin her hopes seeing how she acts around me, her friends seem to be very enthusiastic about the entire thing, and she has mentioned that she spoke about me to her father (her mother passed away when she was young) and that he would like to meet ""legendary"" me...  


Everything seems to be moving fast, and I don't know what to do. I feel like she is very serious about me and I *am* physically attracted to her (and trying not to act on it, mostly shyness and trying to take things slow, plus the lack of experience), but at the same time I don't feel like there's been a mental click in such a way?  I do care about her, but I don't know if it is in a loving kind of way, or more of a ""helpless animal""-kind of way?


I don't know what to do and feel very conflicted...",relationship_advice
t3_chnojz,Can you become friends with someone you confessed to?,"I confessed my feelings to my high school friend (when we are in college). I don't want my feelings to grow further for him because of my insecurities so I told him to reject me even when I like him. I know he also has feelings for me because he keeps on flirting.

t3_chnodf,"I (24M) drunk called a girl I lost connection to some time ago, and I am really sorry about that.","Two years ago, I met a girl. Since i had zero experience in dating, she rejected me. Several days afterwards, I apologized to her - i really wanted another chance because she seemed an interesting person and we had many things in common. Needless to say, it didn't work -but she said we should stay friends, so I thought i was a little bit too pushy and things will get fixed in time.
We even met several times and she enjoyed my company - or at least that's what she wanted me to believe,because i later found that she agreed only because she thought i'd have felt bad if she rejected me (again).  😞
That's where we lost any contact. 

Last year, I had a serious mental breakdown. A lot of bad things happened (i dont want to go into details).
Now fuck me, I'm a total moron. I was very drunk and idk i thought it was a good idea to call her. I told her that i still love her and I miss her very bad. Fuck me, I'm a moron. She got really mad (and I totally understand her). We barely salute each other nowadays, although we barely meet. And even if we do, she avoids me (totally understandable).

Last week, we met at some coffee shop by pure accident. And since then, I've been thinking about her, and how dumb was i to drunk call her.
I've dated several girls in that time when we didn't talk to each other, but i didn't feel attached at all.

I know, I did a lot of mistakes. And I hate myself for this reason. But is there any chance that she has forgiven me? And, if so, (how) should i ever approach her again? If i explicitly apologize, i'll bring to front what happened back then and it won't help my cause at all :)

P. S. I'm not a sex offender, I didn't want to harass her. I don't expect any sympathy from you. But i think everyone makes mistakes at some point in their lives and I do really want to fix this one. Thank you.",relationship_advice

t3_chjqgo,Am I (F27) too needy when it comes to my BF's (M27) texting?,"what it says on the tin :/

we've been together for about 3\~4 months and everything is amazing. i am falling in love with this person and it's frightening and exhilarating all at once. (i know it's a short amount of time - it feels right)

at the start of our relationship i did hold back on how much i need affection but then we had a huge conversation and i admitted i need it... a lot. we discussed it openly and went away knowing where the other person stood/needed/wanted to feel valued and secure. he's very similar but probably has slightly lower needs than me, which is fine. he knows i like that connection and i tell him when he does something i appreciate, and vice versa. our communication is healthy.

**but.** he's not a great texter. i am very busy and can be quite bad with replying, but with him i reply very quickly, because i want to talk to him and because i don't play games or mess around. i'll message him good morning, goodnight, some things through the day.. we also talk on the phone every few days as our schedules are different and see each other about twice a week (both working). these aren't huge messages and i don't expect war and peace in response. in other words, i prioritise our relationship because i am invested and care about us.

i'm worried i'm expecting too much. it's at the point where i feel unsure about messaging first because he hasn't gotten to it yet. i don't want to come across as needy, but i want to hear how his day is. i want to talk to him.

i think that mixed up in all this is my desire to express how deeply i feel for him. so something as small as texting feels huge in comparison to what's looming. if that makes sense.

**how can i bring this up and discuss it fairly?** we are both busy people and we're not the type to be glued to our phones. having said that, i don't think it's unreasonable to message first or respond quickly, especially if you're by or on your phone anyway.

i know this is stupid. i know. but it's bothering me and i'm not sure why.

any insights? advice on how to talk about it? **how can i relax about something relatively trivial?**

tl;dr: partner doesn't text very much despite a conversation around emotional needs and affection. how can i bring up wanting him to text more without being demanding?",relationship_advice
t3_chnm13,Idk what to do anymore,"I've been married almost nine years now and I have two lovely children with my husband. My husband has never really been the loving and affectionate type. (Emotionally distant) It's kind of always been that way and has gradually gotten worse over the years. He's in the army and is very busy at times. His way of decompressing is to come home and play video games. He's not very active in every day family activities. (Doesn't cook, doesn't clean, doesn't help with kids) I'm a stay-at-home mom. When we first started dating I was in school for criminal justice and graduated with an associates and I also have a degree in medical assisting that I obtained during our marriage. I want to get a job but my husband is not very reliable when it comes to taking care of our kids and isn't supportive either. Financially he only gives me money for groceries and occasionally gas money. He won't even give me money to take the kids out to do stuff while he's away or buy necessities for the household or myself.
After many years of kind of feeling like a single parent and neglected spouse I finally reached my breaking point and cheated on him. I regret this very much and wish I never did it. He then said he was willing to work on our marriage and did for maybe a month but was so upset and hurt. (Understable) He's always been somewhat emotionally abusive but now that I cheated on him it's like he has the green light to just say whatever with no filter and no remorse. 
It's been almost a year and he still treats me like I'm the worst human being on Earth. But at the same time I found evidence of him talking to other women via text, he had a secret Snapchat, and this morning I found out what he's been paying cam girls. He didn't even want to spend money on our kids school clothes and supplies. Yet I've already counted that he spent $135 on cam girls in the past week or so. He's literally spent more money on them then the kids school clothes. Mind you, we have TWO KIDS!!! So I confronted him about it he acted so nonchalant like it was not a big deal. 
I suspect that he cheated on me in the past but I've never had proof... I saw that he sent one of his friends a picture of a female soldier and said ""this is the last thing I'm gonna do before I go"" right before we left our previous duty station. DOESN'T THAT SOUND SUSPICIOUS? I found evidence of him talking/texting to other women before I even cheated on him saying things to them that he would never say to me. I also found text messages between him and another woman in March. He makes it seem like he has a trump card over me because I actually confessed to cheating and he found out who the guy was.
As fucked up as this situation is I still love him but I don't know what to do with my marriage anymore. If we decide to separate I will more than likely go back home which is thousands of miles away from where we're living now. Like I said before I'm a stay-at-home mom and I don't really have any credit and he absolutely refuses to help me financially if I do decide to leave. I really need some solid advise.

She has ADHD, and is occasionally oblivious to certain situations or when Im trying to communicate with her. I know everything is great between us. But around our one year.

This time it was from when we went on a family trip. Long story short, it blew up our entire monthly expense for this trip. We ended up even buying 2.5k worth of souvenirs as we were never out of country before but we just had to try to not buy anything this month and we were fine for next month. My wife and I talked about it and agreed we will be frugal this month as we are going into the negatives. Btw the trip also kind of sucked. There were some tension during the trip between the family members.

&amp;#x200B;

Pass a few days, she asked me to buy some extra merchandise that she needed. Granted they weren't complete essentials but quality of life items for her so I complied. I wasn't annoyed at this point. But come next day, she wants to buy 60 dollars worth of lipstick now. At this point I got a bit annoyed. I was just so sick of telling her we can't afford it and I thought I went over our finances with her. This is where I should have told her kindly if we can buy it next month. But being an idiot I am, I was passive aggressive about it. I started to get annoyed about Italy too because the whole trip sucked and 2.5K worth of souvenirs were all for my wife and her parents. I didn't get anything for myself at that point because I didn't really want anything and I was happy being able to get my wife and her parents things but at this point I just started to get so upset.

&amp;#x200B;

I started thinking why does she even have to ask me about the lipstick. Anyways I don't even recall how the argument ended up going down but some old arguments were resurfaced and at the end of it all, I ended up called her a selfish b!tch. I never called her names before. I was just so frustrated. It was horrible of me to call her that.

t3_chid9s,"I've known this girl my entire life, had a huge crush on her for the longest time even though I didn't know her well, and now I'm going to see her again","I've \[20M\] known this girl \[20F\] my entire life because my parents were very good friends with her parents, and they were part of the same community in town for years before they all got married and my parents moved away. We've lived far away from them for my lifespan, but usually once or twice a year we'd go down to the town and visit them and the rest of the community. I always liked her generally, but when I was around 9, we moved out of country and didn't visit them for a couple of years. When we moved back, we were still far away, but that first time coming back that we visited them was when I started having a crush on her.

Life started becoming busier as we became teenagers, and some times when we visited, she wasn't there. I barely saw her during my teen years at all. Also this was where my shy and awkward teen years started, while she blossomed socially, which made it more difficult to approach her. We also had completely different interests, I'm more math and science and she's art and writing, so my teenage mind didn't know much of anything to talk about with her, so I didn't.

She's always been adept socially, and she was very talented teenager, entering contests and winning them. I had thought she could be my league because I was also very talented in other activities, but I've always really sucked when it comes to being social, not having much to say in most situations, or just saying different/awkward things from the rest of the group. When I was a tween/young teens, I thought I would be able to get over it, I would become better at being social, and by the time we were both grown up, I would ask this amazing girl to marry me.

But as far as I knew, she never had any feelings for me.

So I had a this huge crush on her, and I would think about her every other day, if not every day. And this was through ALL my teen years. The intensity of the crush just build up and build up over that time. I believe the fact that I barely even saw her over that time made it worse and more unrealistic.

I believe I made an image of her in my mind, the personification of the perfect girl, and everything that I heard about her from people I knew confirmed it.

Even if I had crushes and liked other girls, she was always the girl I thought I'd marry, because really no other girls I knew could compare to her. I would have dreams about her and how nice and friendly she was, and what an amazing person she was.

But alas, I was a depressed during all my teen years. In the groups of friends I had, I was always the quite one, listening but not talking much. I always felt ignored and like an outsider. The worst of it was around age 16/17 when I thought, ""what was even the point of being around people, it never works, so I'll just stop being around people."" I was really just a sad emo teen (not actually emo style, but just really depressed all the time).

I never spent time much on social media, like facebook, twitter, or instagram. My experience with social media has mostly been watching youtube, reading reddit, and maybe the occasional facebook every now and then to generally keep updated.

It was then, around 17, that we went to visit the town after a couple of years away. I was in one friend's house helping out, when I saw her coming through the window. That was when I realized just how intense my emotions for her had become.

It was like nothing I had ever felt before, and she was actually right here in person.

I really couldn't act normal around her, and when I tried to have a conversation with her, I couldn't carry it, and it ended kinda awkwardly.

Still, I loved her, and told myself I still had time in my life to improve myself socially to be able to be with her.

After the trip, things went back to normal, and I got wrapped up in my usual life. But I still thought about her every day, it was a habit now. I couldn't stop thinking about her.

It was during this time that I started to slowly recover from being a depressed teen. I would force myself to go to social situations, and realize that I felt better and less depressed afterwards, even though awkward situations happened all the time. It was a continuing struggle, but I knew I had to get through it if I wanted to do anything with my life.

Two years after that last time I saw her, we went back and I saw her again this last time. It happened again, where I didn't know she was in town. We were going to a friend's house, and then it was mentioned that she was there. I panicked internally. I had these feelings last time, and they all came back in all their intensity.

Despite that, this time was better, and I was able to have a few decent conversations with her when my family or friends were also in the conversation. She was more beautiful, wonderful, and amazing than ever.

But now, finally, I was able to start to turn that perfect image of a girl into an actual person. It really helped my emotions in perspective of what they really were, even though they were still so strong.

On the last day, we went to a party, and we had to leave to go home before it ended. I couldn't build up the courage to say bye to her, and I really regretted it and still do.

Afterwards I felt sick for days, where it was difficult for me to eat. There was a really empty feeling in my stomach, and it was hard trying to stop regretting every small thing about every time I was around her.

But eventually, I was able to become busy with my life, and was able to recover from that. I have gotten a little better at being social since then, and found a wonderful group of friends where I truly feel like I fit in. In that time, she's got a boyfriend now, and they are really happy together from what I've seen on social media.

However, I'm going to visit the town soon again, and I don't want what happened before to happen again. I know I'll never be with her, she's happy with someone else. I've been working on my feelings and making them more realistic, and thinking of her more as a normal person. I won't really know how I'll actually feel and react until I see her.

Now, I just want to get to know her if I see her, and I'm hoping that will be able to settle my feelings for her. My goal is to hopefully just be friends with her, because I know I don't have any chance with her at all. I want her to be happy with the person she loves.

But I have to get to know her, otherwise I know I'll never be able to settle my emotions with a non-realistic view of her, and without grounding them in the (relatively) normal person she actually is.

All this time I never told my friends or my family about how I feel about her, and I feel too embarrassed if my friends and family ever found out. Most importantly, she can never find out about my feelings for her.

Please, I need help because this has basically been my entire life. Things from my awkward teenage years haunt me every day, and I've been working on fixing the terrible damage I did inadvertently to myself emotionally and mentally back then. But I feel like I have a good chance here to fix this one thing.

Has anyone else experienced something like this, and do you have any advice on how deal with the feelings and thoughts? Specifically anxiety and not thinking clear when talking to her. Thanks from the bottom of my heart.",relationship_advice
t3_chnh1p,How can you tell the difference between just falling out of love and not loving each other anymore?,"My (25F) boyfriend (29M) of 2.5 years and I have been through quite the rough patches for a number of reasons. We have honestly been miserable and things just haven’t been the same. Yesterday my coworker and our patient were talking about marriage and reasons for it. We joked that marriage isn’t really about love since those lovey dovey feelings usually fade. Since I’ve been having trouble with my boyfriend, I wanted some advice on how I can tell if the lovey feelings have just faded or if we just don’t love each other anymore. What should I be looking for?

TLDR; see title",relationship_advice
t3_chngyv,I [23M] started to see a girl [22F] but I have problems to understand if something is a signal in my way or not.," So some weeks ago I met a girl and I directly felt a pretty good  sympathy for her. She is from another country and was here in her  vacations to visit her family. The day she got, my Spanish teacher (who  is her aunt) invited me to have diner with them.  
That day was the first time we met, we didn't talk that much and also had some problems to communicate, because she only speaks Spanish and my Spanish right now is still not the best.  


After  that evening I wrote to my Spanish teacher, that if her niece ever felt  bored in the time she is here she could write me to do something. (At  that moment my intentions were just to be a nice guy and to show her  some places here if her family was busy)  
To clarify the situation I  have to say that I also had a girlfriend at this moment, and we were in a  difficult situation, my (at that time) girlfriend was in another  country for her degree. We didn't really talk to each other in months  and it felt like our relationship was already dead for some time.  
In  the next week the niece of my Spanish teacher asked me to go to the  center of the city her family is living in and I said yes. We went to  the center of the city to visit an ancient church and after that we went  to a nearby lake. In the beginning of that day it was a bit hard to  start a conversation, I felt like I asked way  to many questions, and she was replying them pretty shortly. I could  see that she was pretty nervous and I felt the same way, but the more  time we spend together the more relaxed we got and the easier it was to  talk to each other.  
At the lake we went to restaurant to get  something to drink. It was quite a romantic atmosphere, the sun was  already setting slowly, there was a free concert of classic music  nearby, so we could more or less hear some music and the weather was  perfect.  
At that place we drank some alcoholics and talked and  laughed a lot. We decided to add each other on Facebook and then I saw  in her profile picture that it was with another guy, and I was asking ""that is your boyfriend?"" and she told me ""yes"".  
After  we finished our drinks at the restaurant, we headed back to the city,  to a small bar I like. Because I already feel like this text is getting  way bigger than I thought I will shorten things a bit up and simply say,  we drank a lot that night. We really drank a lot and also spent still a  lot of time together, when we decided to leave the last bar of the city  it was around 6 a.m. and we headed for the train station. We didn't  kiss us that night, we were just pretty close to each other and cuddled,  of course because it was pretty cold already but I can't stop to think  that this was not the main reason. On the way to the train station we  started to hold our hands, and we wouldn't let them go until we reached  the house of her aunt.  


After that day I told my no ex-girlfriend about what happened, and we decided to break up our relationship.  
In  the following weeks the girl and I spend a lot of time together, we  visited more places, went to restaurants, gone bowling and more. In  these moments we were affectionate to each other, but somehow also again  a bit shy. With her signals I could see she feels the same way as me,  like the way she looked at me, the way we hugged us, the way we talked  or how we behaved.  
I wanted to kiss her or hold her hands again, but I  thought it was not correct because she has a boyfriend. I mean I feel  like I'm totally lost in love with her, but I don't want to break up her  relationship. Somehow it's hard to describe, I'm hoping basically every  moment that I will receive a message which says ""my boyfriend and I broke up"" and it makes me feel like I'm the biggest asshole, but I also don't want to actively destroy their relationship.  
To  end the story, the girl is right now in her country again. Before she  left, she told me that I should visit her in her next vacations.  


I  can't really say for what kind of advice I'm asking here right now,  basically I also still feel confused because the recent break up from my  ex-girlfriend and I guess for some time it's better to stay alone. What  I know right now is that I feel love for this girl, that I want to see  her again and that I want her to be my girlfriend.  
The question is,  how should I behave now? I want to write her, to be at least a bit in  touch with her, but I also don't want to annoy her with my messages.  Also, I feel like I interrupt already too much in her relationship if I  start to write her constantly. I know I would also feel bad for her  boyfriend somehow if I would do something to interrupt their  relationship. All of this makes me just pretty confused.",relationship_advice
t3_chngyi,My girlfriend’s Christian parents refuse to accept me because of my Religion,"Hello all, I’m not sure if this is the right place to post something like this but I desperately need advise. 

So almost 2 years ago when I was a freshman in college, I met this girl who is black and Christian (I am Indian). I never thought of her of more than a friend until this past February where we started to become much closer and I started to catch feelings for her. Low and behold, a month later I asked her out. My parents found out pretty quickly after (I guess I’m bad at hiding stuff like that) but she decided to not tell her parents because she was afraid of their response. I understood and told her to take her time. 

As time goes on, I fall more and more in love with her. We have similar viewpoints on almost everything and best of all, she loves me just as much as I love her. It may be too early to say this but I believe she is my soulmate. I can’t imagine my life with anyone else. I also have never been much of a ladies man so the fact that I even found a girlfriend is unreal to begin with. 

So on to present day, my girlfriend is currently in another state for an internship but is returning soon. She agreed it is probably time to tell her parents about us and that’s exactly what she did yesterday. Well, first, she told her grandmother who, according to her, seemed excited for us. She did however warn that her mom is not going to be happy since I am not Christian. 

She called her parents right after and told them she was seeing someone (keep in mind, I’ve met her mother before so she knows who I am). Anyways, the first thing her mother asked was my race and religion. After hearing that I am Indian and “Hindu” (I’ll get to this in a bit) she completely went into denial. The whole rest of the phone call was basically my girlfriends mom telling her how she doesn’t approve and so on. To make matters worse, she kept referring to me as her “friend”. 

The biggest, and only issue tbh, is my religion. Now, I am technically a Hindu but this is essentially only by association. I am not very educated on my religion and don’t practice it or follow it much at all. I do believe in God but not necessarily from a Hindu aspect. To be honest, I’m not sure what religion I am, I just say Hindu cuz I was raised that way and it’s just easier. Even my parents aren’t very much religious at all but they still follow it much much better than me. 

Now, most of you can see my dilemma. I love and care for this girl and I know that she loves and respects her family. I eventually want to be involved in her family as well. I also really want to go to church with church with them, not just to prove I’m dedicated, but also just to educate myself because I don’t really have much knowledge on either Christianity or Hinduism. 

So I guess the question is, how do I prove to her parents that I truly love her and care for her and that religion can still be a big part of her life when she’s with me? Also, how can I convince them to overlook my religion and focus on how much I love and care for her. 

TLDR: I’m an unreligious Hindu dating a black Christian and her parents don’t want anything to do with me because of my religion.",relationship_advice
t3_chean7,This guy’s job was to register my number but he also wrote it down and messaged me,"So there’s this store in my town that gives some art classes, I’ve gone there to take classes on winter vacation and on this summer vacation. 

So there was this guy who is much older than me (im 17), every time I went to the store we talked a little, mainly he would come up to me for some small talk on winter vacation, then I didn’t go to the store for months until recently and he was still there. He came to the class when the teacher when it wasn’t that eventful and sat at my side and talk. 

So there was this frequent client thing you could sign up to and get cool discounts. He is at the register and I give him my info.

Now I stopped taking classes two days now. I was chilling today when I noticed I got a message from an unknown number, I ask who it is and its him (of course). I tell him I don’t remember giving him my number, he says I didn’t that he got it and apologized if its weird. 

I’m not sure of what to do, is he trying to be my friend or more? The second option would be a red flag but the first is still kind of weird.

t3_chnf1n,"I have feelings for two women at the same time, but I am sure it’s only true to one. I have my conscience but need to understand what’s the right thing to do.","After a really great amount of thought for more than a month and a half I am finally here on this sub. Hope people understand me try to solve my problem with great advices. TL:DR; at the bottom

Little background. I am in a long distance relationship with my high school friend past three years. It is really great so far. She is a great woman. She is everything one can get in their relationship. I visit her often except I haven’t visited her in last one and half year or so because of some external factors. Now when I say long distance it’s really long. But we made sure our setup was perfect. We had great time even during this time. We were also planning to get married like a year and half from now(don’t judge me, but that is how it is from where I am). Both the families are super happy about it. It was just great. 

Plot twist, I started liking a woman from where I live. She is really nice, sophisticated, beautiful, independent woman. I am not sure when this started happening but before I knew I started liking her very much. This woman knew about my girlfriend, but I told her that we are now not in good terms and not working well for us and we are working towards progress, which is entirely a lie(sorry for being an asshole, needed to get this off my chest). I was probably scared that she will never like me back the way I want knowing I am in a relationship which is right thing to do for her.

I was convincing(may be increasing my liking) towards her by telling same stories to our mutual friends too. Now this is where all fuck up happens for me. I am soon moving out of this city and thought, may be I should tell her how I feel about her(just because she always thought me as a good friend and she deserves to know, I know this was not right on my part, that I realized only after I told her). Yes I told her how I felt one fine evening, and told how she knew I have a girlfriend and am still planning to get married to her(maintained the fake story, but kept the intent right), yet happened to like her during these disturbances. I thought once am out of this city it will be all right. After that I started liking her more, I am now more attracted to this woman and not my girlfriend any more. I am unable to keep this woman from my place off of my head. I think that’s only because I see her every day. 

I weighed my pros and cons, my girlfriend wins every time. My list is bizarre and I am feeling awkward to put it out here, but with an honest list the result is still the same my girlfriend wins. Except I am not feeling the same thing for my girlfriend. I messed this whole thing up in my perfect long distance relationship. Now I am constantly thinking about the new woman and thinking about rightful ways to break up with my old one(which in my opinion is not fair to her) in my opinion I think I should move out of this place and see if the feelings for this second woman were temporary and if I feel the same connection with my girlfriend. 

I am emotionally attached to my girlfriend and I think its too complicated to get out of this relationship. I am sure I cannot start one with other one because it was all based off of a lie. Please advice if I need to be in this relationship and work towards it and tips that would help or, should I stay away from women for being a creep.

TL:DR; in a long distance relationship, liked another girl, lied to her about previous relationship. Expressed her about my feelings. Now am confused. Please advice the right thing to do. 

P.S: Please forgive me my bad english, I had a friend proof read this. This is the best I can get to. My writing skills are really poor. Forgive me if I misstated anything.",relationship_advice
t3_chneyu,My girlfriend (19 F) broke up with me (20 M) over personal issues and stress,"Me and my girlfriend dated for 3 months and we both fell for each other very quick. Even though you guys might say that’s a very short period of time we both really loved each other and always thought we’d have a promising future.

My girlfriend has issues at her home. She has a babysitting job and babysits 24/7 so she’s always tired and stressed and on top of that her mom’s bf lives with her and really hates her and verbally abuses her so that also depresses her. I knew about this all along but I never knew she was close to her breaking point

Yesterday afternoon she broke up with me over text because she said she’s not happy with her life right now and she’s constantly tired, stressed, and depressed. She also said she wants to find herself and maybe in the future we can give us another chance and asked if we could be friends and I declined. I was hurt but I understood her intentions.

A few hours ago she called me crying explaining everything to me and told me she was close to her breaking point and didn’t wanna lash out on me because it’s not fair to me and I didn’t deserve that. She told me she’s in a very bad place right now and a relationship isn’t what she needs at this point of her life. After that she told me she wants to be friends with me because i’m a very amazing person and she still wants me in her life and couldn’t imagine it without me. I told her I couldn’t be friends with her because I loved her and he broke down crying again and told me if I ever needed anything she’ll always be here for me.

I obviously still very much love her and I know I can’t fix her problems, I can only be there for her and support her. But at the same time I still wanna give us a chance and I don’t really wanna be friends with someone that I love because that’s torture.

What are your opinions on this and how should I go about it? Should I just move on and let her deal with these issues or be a friend and support her?",relationship_advice
t3_chneqn,I (M28) don't know what to do with my f***ed situation with gf (F25),"So to start with a little back story I met this girl through work. At the time my wife and I were having major problems and she was 1 month pregnant with my son. My wife and I had a dead bedroom for months and months prior to drunk sex on a ""try to save the relationship"" vacation which produced the pregnancy. Talking started with harmless flirting and progressed into a physical affair. She found out early on I was married and had a baby on the way. After the affair I became even more distant and unattached to my wife and we separated. I know I accept all the blame and I lied to the current girlfriend about the situation and that all came to a head and I ghosted her and everyone else. After failed attempts to reconcile with my wife on my part I started talking to the girlfriend again. There is just no connection anymore with my wife like I care about her but I'm not attracted to her at all anymore. Obvious trust issues were present with the new gf but we made it work....that was until my son was born. Since then it is a constant fight every day. Multiple times she will tell me to fuck off, tell me I make her life more complicated, and go hours and occasionally days without talking to me then out of the blue she will text me and say she misses me or how hard it is not talking to me. We will somewhat reconcile and everything will be fine until she snaps into a fit again over the smallest thing. Ex: we were doing great for 3 days and planned to meet for lunch while I was at work, I was sitting in the parking lot of the restuarant and had to cancel lunch because of work(I'd rather not say what I do but it was urgent) and she hadn't even left her house yet. She proceeded to cuss me on the phone and tell me to fuck off and that I just complicated her life and hung up on me. She tells me shes depressed and recently started anxiety medication and birth control which is soon after all these problems with her up and down mood all started. I try to do everything I can for her. She works two jobs and goes to school two days a week. I bring her food, I help her around her house, I help her with bills when she needs it, I fixed her closet after she had a terrible day and got home hanging clothes and the shelf fell dumping all her clothes. I never get thanked, she never apologizes, I'm at a complete loss. I love her to death but I can't keep being treated like I am and I dont know how to get her to see my side without her going off on me and saying I'm selfish.

I'll apologize ahead of time for my senseless rambling.",relationship_advice
t3_chlcle,"My partner loves me and doesn't want to break up, but doesn't want our relationship - what do I do?","Buckle in, this is a long one!

*All things said were in a discussion and from a point of honesty, not an angry argument.*

My partner and I have been together for 3.7 years now and we have lived together for nearly a year. Like any relationship we've had our ups and downs; but we've always found a solution. 

We are very different people but that has worked for us. He likes outdoors, I like books. Our common interests are ""nerdy"" things (Harry Potter, D&amp;D and Video Games); we also share a friend group, but also have friends outside of the group which is how we originally met.
We also have common long term goals, we want big families - as many children as we can comfortably afford to support etc.

Recently he has lost weight and is feeling more himself, he's wearing nicer clothes and generally making more of an effort - I'm very proud of him!

I am close with his family (this may or may not be relevant; but a close relative of his is sick and has been given a final date range) and am the god-mother to his niece (his sister and I were friends before we met). Our lives are generally quite intertwined, but we both have our own spaces to retreat to when we needed a break.

He is currently working at a summer camp of sorts, but we live near so he comes home at night. He is surrounded by like-minded people who love the same outdoorsy things he does.

Last week I said to him that I was feeling ignored/left out, as when he did this summer camp before (it's an annual thing lasting about 2 months) I was invited to the socials and he would tell me about his day etc. but this year nothing, I was barely getting a text back in days. 
We discussed this a week or so ago, and he said that he was trying to avoid thinking about his relative by keeping busy  and also that he was genuinely happy - I'm not going to get in the way of that, especially now!
 
Fast forward to yesterday, he spoke to me and said that while he loves me (not in love), he worries that we are together out of habit, were encouraged to be together by our friends etc. 
He also said that he wasn't happy in the relationship, he doesn't think it's normal that we don't talk anymore and squabble (I agree and this is something I want to work on, when he is available to spend some time with me), we don't eat together anymore (he's vegan, I'm Keto - although I feel like he just eats and rushes out anyway) he said that he gets annoyed when I speak sometimes, he is trying to keep me separate from the things he enjoys and generally he feels like a new person and doesn't know how we fit. He also said that I deserve someone who will properly appreciate me, so I'm getting mixed messages.

I suggested a trial separation because maybe he needs some time to do his own thing and work himself out (he said he doesn't know what he's achieved in life or what he is doing), we have been together since we were 19 and I know that people change. We would be looking at moving out and living separately also.

I knew we needed to work on some things and I knew that him being on this summer camp definitely exacerbated the issues. Honestly, I'm a bit resentful of it because it's making him happy when I apparently can't and it's making it so much harder to work on the problems anyway.

But when we spoke about this yesterday, he said that he doesn't want to do anything about it (essentially put this aside) but maybe work on it? (I'm not sure honestly) for 5 weeks until the camp is over is over. But I feel that that is incredibly selfish of him because we live together and I have no idea how to behave with him now.

He says that he doesn't necessarily want to break up and that he always wants me in his life; honestly I can imagine spending the rest of my life with him because normally he is a good partner in life. He went to sleep hugging me yesterday and kissed me before I went to work, but I have no idea where I stand with him now.

t3_chlcg4,My Mom (50sF) and Grandmother (60sF) Keep Humiliating My Little Sister (19F) Because of Her Weight. How Can I(23F) Support her?,"I hope I'm in the right sub for this. I really need advice as the situation is becoming really bad.

 So this has been happening for years now. My mom and grandmother (sometimes aunts join in if they're present) gang up on my younger sister whenever they see her (yes, every time) especially when she leaves her room to have a meal or a snack. I know they're just worried about her but the way they say things to her is just humiliating. They see her go get some breakfast and if whatever she has on the plate is not to their liking they start yelling at her and telling her she should have a boiled egg instead for example (???:D). 

My sister already knows she needs to lose weight but  they keep cornering her and putting more pressure on her. I know that she already is having internal struggle with this and a lot of self esteem issues. 

For the past 2 months, she's been staying in her room and eating there. Whenever she comes out for a while she tries to avoid my mom for obvious reasons. I think this whole thing is making her relationship with food worse and probably developed an eating disorder. I really want to help her get out of this. She's a really beautiful person and it's such a shame what they're doing to her is killing her on the inside.

I know the post so far seems like I haven't done anything while my sister was suffering but I did try to stop my mom from commenting on my sister's weight but she does not listen to me. I keep telling her that she's just making things worse when she keeps bringing this topic up everytime she sees her daughter. I've also tried to get my sister into good habits by gifting her a gym membership last year which she used at the beginning. Things were going well, she was eating healthier and working out but when exams came she stopped working out and used studying as an excuse for eating junk and not working out. She never went back to the gym after that but I never give her shit for it because I know that she will only do these things for herself once she's ready and no one can force her to. I try to set a good example but it makes things worse because family keeps comparing us to each other and I don't want her to start resenting me. I just don't know what to do at this point. I can tell her mental health is getting worse and I want to support her as much as I can.

Today we managed to book her for a mental health consultation but we have to wait a month for that. What can I do meanwhile to support her? Any advice would be appreciated.

t3_chitvq,"Is it okay for my Sister(20F) to hang out with ""friends"" that did her and her sister wrong?","This is my first post on here and just needed some advice and or an opinion on the situation

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 sisters, Hannah and Maria (Both 20F). Not too long ago, Hannah was talking to Craig(20M) (Her current boyfriend), and they were basically dating at that point, but when we went on vacation, Craig and Lily (Lily was best friends with Craig, Hannah, and Maria) had sex. After that, Craig told Hannah what happened and did everything he possibly could to get her back. Lily(20F) told Hannah she didn't care and she hoped it would ruin Craig and Hannah's relationship. After a couple weeks of Craig begging for forgiveness, Hannah forgave him and then they started officially dating.  After a few months, Lily asked if they could be friends again but Hannah said no.  Lilys response to her saying no was sending Hannah the lyrics to ""Nobody's Perfect"" by Hannah Montana.  After that they didn't really speak much but there would come points where Lily would ask their friends (they all had mutual friends) to choose between her or Hannah. Lily also started to say, months after it happened that Craig raped her.  Which was not the case.  When Hannah first found out Lily and Craig had sex, Lily said that she didn't regret it, and they did it out of boredom.

But latley, Maria has been hanging out with Lily and Amy(20F) (another close friend in their friend group).  Amy and Maria have a bad past as well.  Maria had strong feelings for a boy named Brandon for years.  She would vent to Amy all the time about how she felt about Brandon(20M) and how much she loved him.  But Maria had found out that Amy had slept with Brandon even though she knew how Maria felt about him.  When Amy was confronted about it, she told Maria that Brandon raped her when that wasn't the case either. At that point, Amy just wanted attention.

But my point is, lately Maria has been hanging out with both these girls who did Hannah and her so dirty.  She hangs out with them because she's bored but I still don't think thats an excuse to hang out with someone who did you and your sister so wrong.  This is where I am asking for advice or opinion on this situation. I believe Maria shouldn't be doing that to her own sister, Hannah, and shows a lack of character and respect towards Hannah. 

Is it right for Maria to be doing this or justified in anyway?

t3_chk8jb,I (21M) had to choose between 2 women. Did I make a mistake? What can be done?,"Okay so here’s a bit of background: Back in December I began seeing this girl, named Hannah. We both go to the same college and are the same age, and we got along quite well. At first it was more of a hookup thing, but over time we became more couple-like, however we were never officially dating. I’m ashamed to admit I used this to my advantage, sleeping around for a good bit and generally weakening our would-be relationship through my borderline sex addiction. Fast forward to April: the school year was ending, but we were closer than ever, and we both left our college town with the perception that we would resume in the fall and most likely begin to officially date. However, about a month into being home, I met someone else, Lydia. Lydia and I worked together, and became fast friends. Eventually, I realized I had begun to develop feelings for Lydia, and made the decision to call Hannah and tell her I couldn’t pursue things further with her. Since then, Lydia and I have been exclusively dating for almost 2 months, and it’s been pretty great. However, in the last week or so, I have begun to wonder if I made a poor decision. Lydia is out of town, and since she has been, I’ve been thinking of Hannah an awful lot. I feel guilty for calling things off with such a good person, but I wonder if this is more than that. Lydia is 3 years younger than me, and will be 3 hours away from me when school resumes in a few weeks. Furthermore, she plans to move to California next year, and I have no idea if we could make that work. She’s currently out of the country, and in the week she’s been gone I’ve thought about Hannah a lot, so I can only imagine how an extended period of no minimum contact would affect me.

t3_chn973,my girlfriend said my six year old is a stressor.,"My girlfriend (27) and I (31) had been dating since January. 

I have primary custody of my son. She knew about him since the beginning. Things were going incredibly well so I introduced my son to her after a few months. He adored her. Which scared me to be honest.

A couple of days ago, I tried to call her and didn't get an answer. I decided to wait to see if she would call back. After about an hour I checked my phone. I had a missed text. ""I answered but I guess you're busy."" so, I called her back and was immediately greeted with attitude and accusations of ignoring her. Statements like ""I haven't been happy for months, I'm obviously not a priority to you."" Then she went on saying how she avoided hanging out after work anymore because my son ""stresses her out"". After seeing each other for six months, this is the first time hearing about it. She said she only invited us over this past weekend because she was willing to ""deal with the stressor"" in order to spend time with me.

I was beyond offended. It was quite soul crushing to know how much my son adored this woman only to know she sees him as a ""stressor"". I may have been reacting out of emotion and I decided to ended it but feel rather guilty about it. Am I wrong?

Not to mention, there have been a few times she's addressed issues, but when I ask for the detail so I could fix it, she suddenly ""doesn't remember"". And, She also still has a memorial or a ""shrine"" of her late boyfriend with multiple pictures of him. She still talks about him to me several times a week, which honestly made me feel like she wasn't done grieving. I kinda feel like those were red flags and I just kept going on anyway.

We are supposed to talk about things this afternoon. I'd really appreciate if someone could help me see where I was wrong so I could try to fix it.",relationship_advice
t3_chn913,How can I (20f) stop being so afraid of my boyfriend after I was violently assaulted in a past relationship?,"Hi everyone, this is kind of hard to write because I'm ashamed to admit it. I'm (20f) afraid of my boyfriend (20m) and he doesn't deserve it at all. It's my ex's fault. 

I was in a relationship with this man (now 24m) for about a year. He was my first love, my first serious relationship, my first time, etc. While I was actually in the relationship, I thought everything was perfect and we were so in love. Now I've realized he did a lot of tactics and manipulation to make sure I always needed him and I just sort of let him. 

The relationship ended one night when he came home drunk as all hell and furious about something. I fought back, it got nasty, and long story short he ended up beating me to the ground and raping me there. I had to leave him after that. I was hospitalized- he could have killed me. I felt I owed it to my past self, who dreamed of living a life free of abuse, to walk away. 

I was really fucked up after what happened. It took me a really long time to even be able to look directly at a man after that. I know it's not right. I know many men are very good people. But I became acutely aware of exactly how much physical power any  guy had over me at any given time, if that makes sense. I mean, I'm 5'2 and 100 pounds, so most men (and women to be honest) are a lot stronger than me. I can never forget the way my ex just snapped and was immediately able to overpower and hurt me. I was so scared of everyone.

I wasn't planning on being in a relationship  when I met my current boyfriend, about 10 months after the event. I had really been focusing on school and therapy (after a temporary episode of feeling extremely suicidal and reckless) the past few months and boys were the last thing on my mind. But he is sweet, cute, and funny, and won me over. I evaluated myself and decided I was doing well. I told him about what happened with my ex pretty early on and we took it slow. 

He is really, really great, and my feelings towards him are really strong. He's so kind and ambitious, and very very sweet to me. But. I still have that fear. I can push it away a lot because I like him so much, but not always. We'll be laying there in bed and I'll think about how easily he could pin me down and do whatever he wanted. I don't always feel safe unless I have some sort of way to defend myself. During sex, I will sometimes think, ""would he stop right now if I asked?"" and I convince myself that he wouldn't, then I get upset and ruin it for myself, but I still don't ask him to stop because I'm afraid he won't. It's so unfair to him- he has always told me he would never want me to do something I don't want to. It would probably kill him inside to know that I've thought about him in this way. 

The thing that gets me is, my ex never seemed abusive before that one time. Maybe there were red flags, but I never saw them. And I can say for a fact that he never hit or sexually violated me at all before that night. So how am I supposed to trust anyone to not suddenly switch like that? How am I so unable to trust my boyfriend after just one event? 

What triggered me writing this post is what happened the other night. My boyfriend and I were out drinking (as we have several times before) and got a bit hammered. We ended up getting in a stupid, small fight, like not even that mad just bickering. But when we got home and he raised his voice I freaked out and started crying. He realized why I was upset and spent the rest of the night apologizing and comforting me which is so sweet of him but god I just feel so pathetic and weak. I fear that I may be gettig out of control. I have been working really hard on my mental health &amp; don't want to lose this boy. Help.",relationship_advice
t3_chjetq,Caught boyfriend using dating apps 🏳️‍🌈 (story),"On 4th of July, my boyfriend of 3 years was driving and he had me look up directions on his phone.  When I looked for Waze I saw the scruff icon on the last page of apps on his iPhone. (Seemed recently downloaded.) I was a bit drunk so I decided not to bring it up that I saw the app. I’m not one to snoop so I tried not to think about it for the next few weeks. 

Fast forward to today, he asked me to grab his phone from his car parked on the street when I walked to the store.   My curiosity got the best of me and I searched to see if the scruff app was still downloaded.  It was he had moved it to a folder.  I  opened the app and read through his recent messages.  There were some on the 13th and the 19th. All occurring while I was sleeping. 
Some of them had photos sent, some his messages were of sexual nature, and he was clearly trying to meet up. 
(Side note: he either got ignored or moved the convo to another app, so I don’t think anything has happened yet.)

What kills me is he speaks negatively about people on apps and insists on being monogamous.  
On top of it all, I have initiated conversations about opening up our relationship in the recent past and he did not respond well.  

To complicate things we’ve  lived  together for the past 1.5 years and just signed a year lease on a new place three months ago... I literally can’t afford to move out, so I’m in a bind.  I just spent my savings on new furniture, down payments etc. I feel like if I bring it up now we’ll still have to live together for a while and I can’t imagine that would be pleasant.

Think of any bad thing you could imagine in a relationship and she did it. Anyway, ever since then, I've been struggling with the breakup and constantly think of how pretty she was. I have this constant obsession of trying to one up my ex and get a better looking girl to prove her wrong. 

Anyway, flash back to a week ago. I hooked up with this girl that I matched with on a dating website. She is very nice, has similar interests, and has also been cheated on. The problem was, when I met her in person, she wasn't as good looking as my ex and slightly unattractive. I'm trying my best not to be shallow, but I feel embarassed when I look at this girl compared to my ex, even though her personality and everything else but looks blows my ex out of the water.

My problem is, I‘m overthinking every little thing for example that he once read my message but didnt text back or the other time that he couldnt come over because he simply had a headache and those small thinks make me overthink massivley and then i doubt that he loves me and all that stuff and when i ask him if everythings okay e.g with the message stuff, he says everythings good and that stuff sometimes happens and i just let it be then i feel like an absolute annoying gf. Of course then i worry that by overthinking i annoy him and therefore he might break up if do more annoying stuff and so the overthinking begins.

t3_chfyu8,I have photo evidence my GF was seeing another guy while we were dating. What to do?,"Throwaway because I don't want this to be the way this comes up if it ever does. Here's the situation, I met my girlfriend in a different country. She's adorable and great and I truly love her. But I always suspected she didn't take us as exclusive at least not very seriously. After a few months she got preggers. The couple of months up to this point I'll admit I dropped the ball. I was withdrawn, come up with excuses to not see her a few times, mostly around the holidays. I was lazy and in a bad place mentally due to my job/ situation. Fast forward to recent times, I'm back home, she's back home and very very preggers. We talk over Messenger all the time and one day she falls off the radar. No communication at all. I'm freaking out. I dont talk to her family and had no idea what was happening. I feared the worst. So I went digging through her Facebook to find any posts or any relatives that could give insight on what's happening. I accidently came across a profile of another guy who has him and her kissing as his background, time stamped while we were dating. Obviously I'm bewildered and dig deeper. My conclusion is she publicly announced she was preggers and this guy was devastated, stopped talking to her, and put sad posts up shortly thereafter. This picture is still up to this day mind you so he was obviously pretty hurt. The baby is coming very soon and obviously I'm getting a paternity test, mostly because it's expected between two people making a baby halfway across the world and my job may even require it. I'm confident I am the father due to timing of events and having known her for a long while now. Long post but it boils down to: when do I bring it up, if ever. And can I trust her once she's here with me and isn't obviously preggers? I'm leaning towards biting the bullet, leaving well enough alone and loving the crap out of this baby.

TL;DR: my girlfriend had some sort of relationship with another guy while we were dating. We're now slated to have a baby, marry, live a happy life. Should I ever bring up the fact that I know?",relationship_advice
t3_chn5yw,How can I stop being so insecure in this secure relationship.,"Hello, I am a 21M and I am in a relationship with who I consider to be the love of my life and I can confidently say I want to date this girl for a while and put a ring on that thang. This relationship however, is kind of Rocky. But all of it's problems are from me... in my own head... to myself.

I have dated maybe 4 girls in my lifetime. My first taste at dating was with a very religious family who would only let me see their daughter if I went to church with them, and I could only be alone with their daughter minutes at a time. I agreed thinking it's how all relationships prob go, yada yada.. it was not healthy and definitely messed me up in how I perceived dating should be. My longest relationship after some time of experience (ended this past year after 8 months) was a long distance relationship due to school that ended in many cases of emotional abuse and eventually cheating from my ex-girlfriend.

With my current girlfriend, she is perfect in every way and I honestly love her with all of my heart more than I have ever felt in all of my past relationships combined (I used to just fake it until it worked out. And all of this baggage I carry with me leaves me insecure and I feel like I'm a ticking time bomb who will eventually destroy the relationship for myself.

We text every day and talk everyday, we sometimes even see eachother for like 4+ hours every day, and it's amazing. But we have agreed to go long distance again once school started. And due to my past, I can not help but to think whenever she doesn't text me or anything it's because she's trying to ""play hard to get"" or she's talking to guys she has on the side or something (because that's exactly what happened in my last relationship) and she is NOT like that at all, but I don't know why I can't help but think that. And I am afraid the second I go distance with the girl I see as my soulmate, I'll have this constant belief that she's going to inevitably cheat on me and all of this bullshit I'd make myself slowly believe.

Is there any way I can get over this so I can enjoy this relationship for all it has shown to be? Thank you.",relationship_advice
t3_chn5gq,Boring relationship/sex advice,"Hey everyone,

So I wanted to see if there's anyone out there willing to share their experiences with me and hopefully help each other through this process. Thanks in advance for your time reading and for any help/answers provided.

I am 30, my gf is 28; we've been living together for around 8 months now, we were rash but madly in love, and so chose to live together after just one month of relationship. That is not something any of us regrets, I believe, since that has never been an issue or something we comment on.

We enjoy a lot of activities together and we tend to have an awesome time playing videogames, but over the past couple of months, things have changed elsewhere and this is bugging me.

First some context, I come from meaningless relationships in the past, all of which were mostly me being a sex-toy for people bored of their current relationships, one serious relationship that bored me in the past and that I chose to end since it was not challenging. She, on the other hand, comes from a history of failed, toxic and abusive relationships, the last of which lasted for around 6 years on and off in between her other relationships and that got her to let go of her own self respect, by being with a guy that ignored her except for when he wanted something from her; additionally, she has vocally stated she was a one night stand girl and that she enjoyed sex with many different men and women, sometimes going through up to two different sex partners per day. Her stories go something like ""I had a bf,  we argued, I looked for that one guy to relieve my stress with sex."" This is the guy she spend over 6 years with.

A lot more can be said if asked, but with that context so far, my current predicament stands as follows: she has vocally stated that she would rather we hug instead of having sex; this was not the case a few months ago and has recently become an issue, since I still very much enjoy the thought of having sex with her. Question here I keep trying to answer myself is...other than the obvious (that I suck at sex and she hates it), why would she suddenly stop being interested? She has clearly maintained a lover for years remaining interested about sex and even begged him to stay as monogamous as possible even though they were essentially f#ck-buddies. She sleeps for most of the day as well ever since this started and we are arguing all the time over stupid things. We get over said arguments and are happy again, but sex is mostly dead and even when she's unconscious (sleeping) she comes back for a moment just to push me aside if I try getting close to her.

Thanks for getting this far, feel free to ask questions if you would like to know more.",relationship_advice

t3_chik80,Talk me down: having doubts of leaving my relationship.,"July 6 I told him I would be moving out once I found an apartment. We still share our current apartment and are cordial. No fighting. Just sad silence. We both knew it was coming. It was a 5 year relationship. We endured the hardest parts through teamwork, but now that our personal lives have calmed and things could be peaceful, I want out. We have been dealing with this breakup with the same fair teamwork we’ve always use to deal with challenges. 

I’m (27f) restless and want sexual exploration and to more firmly establish my independence. I also felt isolated from him and felt rejected when I tried to connect. I don’t feel ready to marry to anyone.

He’s (29m) ready to settle down, marry, and wants children but says he’d go without them for the sake of marrying me. He has always treated me kindly, if not coldly. Never harsh or unfair. He is a distant person, even when he is being intimate. He has always provided for me, and taken care of me. 

We’ve talked, and talked, and worked on things, and talked some more. But I just feel it’s time to go. Five years of my twenties is too long to spend on a relationship that doesn’t yet have true, deep, open connection.

I’m so torn... I know if I wasn’t restless and in need of this freedom I could marry him. He takes care of me, I know he’d be a great partner... although not a great “soulmate,” or whatever other common title you want to tack onto someone you feel meant for. But if I ignored this itch to run and explore, I’d always be dissatisfied... but I don’t want to lose him. 

I know this is normal break up emotions pouring out. Fear of change, the wish to hold on to the familiar... I still love him, I just can’t be with him right now... but what about later? What if he’s with someone else when I’m done exploring and have discovered he’s all I want?

TL;DR: I’m scared to leave someone who I have a good partnership with, because maybe I’d want to marry him later. But I don’t want to marry him now. But perspectives change, so who knows?",relationship_advice
t3_chn2az,Grandma's (59F) not good in mental and physical state after grandpa's death,"At first, let me give a quick background of my grandma. She's that kind of woman who constantly needs to work or do something otherwise she'll go crazy. Even though she's tired she'll always find some work to do. She was always like that.

Right after grandpa's death she's undergone surgery of her spine.  After she got a little bit better she went straight to her garden and started working and overloading herself. She didn't listen to us even after my parents had a lot of arguments with her to just rest and let us do the job. She thinks that she's just a burden for our family, that she's an additional person in the house and overall she's a negative mindset. She talks sometimes about how being dead would be better or so.  Of course, she's not always like that, she sometimes goes out with her friends on coffee or goes socializing. Ever since grandpa died, seeing her smile is rare. I try to always help her whenever she needs and have a conversation with her.

At this moment she got problems with her knee and now she walks with a support stick which she didn't need before, thanks to her constant work.  She went to rehab for a month but she walks far worse than before the rehab.

I don't know what to tell her to stop overloading herself and to stop working. All she can do for our family to be helpful is to cook and nothing else. In two weeks I'm going to college and I can't even imagine what she's going to looks like after I go back. I worry that she'll be in a wheelchair which is most likely to happen at this moment. 

We live in one house and both of my parents go to work and brother to school so I don't know how they'll handle the situation if she gets worse. 

Sorry if my English isn't perfect, I'm still learning.

Need some advice.,"Posting this anonymously but long story short I met this amazing guy after a pretty shitty relationship. My last boyfriend was a dick and used to call me fat, and in the bedroom wouldn’t last very long or be sensual or make me feel good about my body.Most of the time because I had grown to feel so insecure, I’d do it with the lights off or wearing a shirt the entire time. I’m a sexual person and I do think that in passing I’m generally attractive enough, but this past relationship has made me so in my head that sex has lost its enjoyment for me.

Fast forward; I’ve met this amazing guy who is really adventurous in the bedroom, not to mention sexy as f***. He will pick me up and throw me around and rip off all my clothes regardless what time of the day it is. It’s so starkly different from my last relationship and I’m fuckin here for it. I think he’s starting to get frustrated though because I’m too insecure to be free with him. I can’t enjoy sex or riding him because I become too self conscious about my pudge, or any scars/hyperpigmentation I have on my body, or just feeling ‘fat,’ like my ex told me. I end up rejecting his offers to shower together and try to grab onto my clothes or beg for the lights to be off and I hate it. I think he is beautiful and I want to enjoy and open myself up to him but I can’t stop feeling scared that one day he’s going to take a look at me, naked, without makeup, and pudgy, and think; ugh, gross.

t3_chmtw2,My parents are manipulating my boyfriend and myself (20f &amp;20m),"
I live with my parents and I’m 20. They are getting so up in my business all the time and I’m honestly sick of having them judging my every decision. They make me feel bad when I want to make decisions for myself. They make me feel bad when I choose other things over their own advice. They constantly have something to say about my actions and behaviour even when I’m not even behaving poorly. I don’t party, I don’t drink or take any drugs, I’m honestly such an innocent person and they think I’m out of control. 
For example, if my boyfriend doesn’t stay over and leaves after we all have dinner, they get angry at me. Because ‘he should be spending time with me at my house’. They get all petty when I stay at his house. They always judge what I do with my boyfriend and always have something to say when it comes to spending time with him. My mum says things like 
‘You need to have respect for yourself ‘ or ‘if he dumps you I won’t be there to be there when you crumble’.
It honestly makes me so mad because they make me feel bad for spending time with him. I know that when I see him at his house or mine, my mum always want to control how we do things. Mind you his mother passed away a few months ago from cancer and he wants to spend time around his family as he still lives at home. They say I take them for granted and that I’m not grateful for all that they do for me. When in reality I am such a good person to them. I’m 20 and I honestly feel like they don’t trust me and my decisions. My mum had never been through a breakup before because my dad was her first love and she’s never experienced the heartbreak.

t3_chfvey,I (24F) think my new coworker (27F) is in danger of getting fired. I want to help her by giving her some feedback.,"So the people involved here are me (24F), my coworker Melissa (36F), my new coworker Cassie (27F), and our boss Ann (40sF). Cassie joined our team about a month ago after someone else left. Melissa took the job of the person who left and I kind of took on some of Melissa’s work while also training Cassie. So basically we are all in a place where we’re learning and getting used to our new tasks and the new team dynamic. Socially, we all get along great! A few things about Cassie. She is a very confident person even if she’s unsure about things, she is very open socially and isn’t afraid to show her personality, and she is competitive so she wants to look capable and feel like she does a good job. However, some of these personality traits have contributed to Cassie making a few missteps in her first month, and Ann told Melissa she isn’t sure about her working out.

Cassie has made a few errors in her work and a few coworkers have told our boss they were put off by some comments she’s made. Cassie also isn’t afraid to take advantage of the freedom and flexibility my boss gives us, and Ann is starting to think she’s maybe too immature. Melissa and I are worried Cassie is in danger of losing her job, and we feel bad because she does do good work and we finally have a positive dynamic on our team. Ann expects a lot of her team, and I can’t help but feel like she’s expecting too much of Cassie. Ann has been traveling a lot lately so hasn’t given Cassie a lot of alone time to mentor her, like Ann did for me when I started. Ann has left most of Cassie’s training up to Melissa and I, but mostly me. I don’t want to feel like I’ve failed Cassie. Ann also compares Cassie to me a lot, and says she wants Cassie to be a “mini-me” which I think is unfair since I’ve been there 3 years and Cassie has been there a month. Obviously Cassie isn’t going to be able to handle all of the same tasks as me and complete her work as quickly or as accurately as I currently do.

Tomorrow, Melissa and I are taking Cassie out to lunch. We think we should try to help and give her some feedback. We all have a pretty casual relationship so I’m not sure how to approach some of these topics. I don’t want to be too serious and make Cassie think something is wrong, but I want to help guide Cassie in the right direction. I especially feel awkward because I’m younger than Cassie and I have rarely had to give others feedback in my career.

TLDR: My coworker is in danger of getting fired. Our boss isn’t sure she is a good fit due to making some errors, both socially and in her work. New coworker doesn’t have any idea her job is in danger. I don’t think my boss has given my new coworker enough guidance or support this fat and I want to give her some feedback to help her. We have a very casual relationship, but I want my coworker to take my feedback seriously without making the situation awkward.",relationship_advice
t3_chmra4,My best friend (F23) and my other friend (M23) agreed to start dating in two months but the next day M23 gets into a relationship,"My best friend Amy has hooked up with my other friend called Callum about two months ago. They both liked each other and wanted to start dating but both didn’t want to admit it. Then a month ago, I rented a beach house and invited a couple of couples down and invited Amy and Callum as well. Callum though ended up hooking with another girl at the beach house who happens to be Amy’s best friend. So she felt like he didn’t like him anymore, but he did.

Anyway the other day we all went to a trampoline place and had fun (Amy and Callum came), but they always went off by themselves and had a chat. After the whole thing I pull Amy a side and ask are you guys dating? (As I have been teasing her about him for a while). She says we have decided to wait two weeks as he wants to settle into his new job more before he starts dating.

Anyway so a couple days later I catch up with Callum and we go for a walk and I bring up Amy. He says oh that’s not happening anymore. He explains to me that the day after we went to the trampoline place he caught up with a girl (Hannah) that he knew and she admitted that she liked him and started telling all her friends that they were dating. I was like so what you going to do? He said oh I am going to date Hannah. And I am there like dude what the fuck. He comes up with some excuses, but I am thinking how Amy is going to feel but I can somewhat understand where he is coming from.

So what do I do in this situation? Amy doesn’t know yet should I tell her?? But she really liked this guy and I am not sure how to explain it and I don’t want to hurt her feelings.",relationship_advice
t3_chmqrr,Me [25M] and my long term GF [24F] want different things in a relationship and its making me depressed,"TLDR at the bottom. Not a native english speaker so sorry for the bad grammar. 

 Full story: We had a really happy relationship for 4 years, during which we were both very fond of each other and spent a lot of time together. During these years, she was actually the one who mostly took the initiative to see me all the time and I was glad that she did. We even talked about starting a family and getting engaged. 

However, after I finished my bachelors degree, she stayed in our hometown whereas I went to a different university for my Masters and a subsequent job offer. Back then, she told me that she would follow me to the new city, but even now, 4 years later, she never did. Ever since I moved away we had less and less contact. We talk roughly 15 minutes per week, send a few text messages, and usually meet up once per month (I have to visit her roughly 3 out of 4 times).

During these years apart, she started to built her own life and is now pretty busy with it, e.g. going to bars twice every weekend and meeting her friends almost all remaining days (she always hated to be on her own, even for a single day). I on the other hand was very focussed on my studies and work but never really exchanged or replaced her with something else. Nowadays, it feels like I’m the only one who is still longing for more contact, whereas she sees the relationship as a nice plus to her otherwise own and independent life, but nothing more.  She’s honest about me and told me that talking or texting once every day would just be too much of a burden for her as it makes her feel restricted. Moreover, when I told her that I don’t want to continue like this and  would come back to our hometown to work there, she didn’t want me to as it would ‚ruin my career‘. Furthermore, any plans we had about starting a family are now postponed to an unforeseeable future. All this is nagging me every day and I don’t really know how to continue. When I told her all this truthfully, her answer was to just break up if I’m unhappy with her or our relationship.

The thing is, I would really love to get back to our old relationship but it feels like that’s not an option as her changes in character seem to be irreversible. Nevertheless, when we meet up, its always a joy and a nice weekend during which she tells me how much she loves me and wants to stay, but afterwards, it quickly returns to a total silence and emotional distance. I can’t really handle the distance but due to the quick change in attitude that she has when we meet up, I somehow still lack the strength to break up. I’ve been trapped in this situation for a few years now and don’t really know what to do. The LDR would continue at least another 4 years (at least that’s what she says at the moment) and I don’t really want to spend all this time in misery.

TLDR: Had a very close and good relationship for 4 years but started a LDR afterwards. During the LDR, she distanced herself from me and canceled all plans for a joint future or family. This makes me depressed and unsure on how to continue.",relationship_advice
t3_chmql8,My dad apologized to me,"Hi there, this is going to be long

BACKSTORY
I [24F] don’t have a healthy relationship with my parents [56M][52F]. They have high expectations of what a child owes parents and how they should behave. My parents have insulted my boyfriend of now 7 years multiple times. They are controlling and condescending. I fought a lot with my dad as a teen. They openly told me they prefer me to lie to them about where I am and what I do, than them allowing me to do certain things when I was a teen. No personal achievement is good enough for them. Therefore I have refrained from sharing more than necessary about myself with my parents the last couple of years. 

My mother has cancer and metastasis have developed three years ago. Her health is currently deteriorating. It looks like she won’t be able to continue chemo due to too high toxicity in her body. I feel her condition makes the already existent family problems so much more complicated.

My father is completely overwhelmed. He has suffered trauma in his childhood and doesn’t take good care of himself. My mom and I used to do all the household chores until I moved out 5 years ago for uni and her health got worse. I have spent almost all of my holidays cooking, cleaning and meal prepping for my parents. They have been thankful but also expected this. They are also very codependent. My dad has cut ties with his family, doesn’t have any friends and works from home. He is completely socially isolated. He relies on me to deal with paperwork and important life decisions.

SIDE NOTE: My brother [21] has also avoided being around my parents the last couple of years. He moved out 2 years ago and doesn’t share any personal stuff with our parents either. 

CURRENT SITUATION
I have been avoiding being around my dad recently. I visit my mom in the hospital every day in the afternoon and my dad goes in the evenings (visiting hours are from 2 to 8pm). When I’m in my parents’ home, I usually spend most of the time in the room I’m sleeping in. I get he only wants to spend time with me and feels very lonely, but I feel estranged. He has crossed boundaries so many times and doesn’t understand where he’s gone wrong.

He has now apologized for not being funny or cheerful. I feel sorry for him, but at the same time I feel I need to protect myself from him.

What would you do in my situation? Am I wrong for keeping my distance? I fear what will happen when my mom is gone and how he will react to her death.

TLDR: My mom is terminally ill. My dad depends on me emotionally and I feel estranged from him. He has apologized for not being a fun dad.",relationship_advice
t3_chmq0g,I (19F) believe my bf (19M) is trying to hint at me to give him my Adderall. Omg. What do I do?!!!,"Helloooo everyone! This is a throwaway and I’m on mobile!

So this past week, I was finally diagnosed with ADD inattentive type. I was prescribed Adderall by my doctor, and tbh, it was like a magic pill. I can focus, get things done, and finally live my life the way it was meant to be led. But that’s obviously not the issue here. 

I’ve been with my bf, G, for around 3 years now. We have both experimented with recreational drugs (none of which were ever prescription drugs), but after my diagnosis, a couple weird things have occurred.

First, he joked about selling them. It was a funny joke, we both share that type of humor, so I thought nothing of it and laughed it off. Then he suggested it another two times, saying I could overcharge and make a bit of money. I finally straight up told him I wouldn’t be selling my Adderall to dumb college kids (we are both dumb college kids, for reference, but I have been professionally diagnosed with ADD and he does not have ADD). For god’s sake, I actually need the medication myself! This happened the day of my diagnosis, which was last Monday. 

Yesterday morning, G and I were discussing exploring recreational drugs together via text, and he told me: “I think I wanna try addy.” I replied basically that he shouldn’t unless he’s been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, and he replied that he was curious. I’m just... what?

As far as I know, Adderall isn’t really abused for fun at colleges, it’s more for studying and focus?? I understand being curious about a drug, but I was just kind of stunned. I left him on read for a couple minutes, trying to gather my thoughts, and he texted me again to ask what I was thinking. I lied and said I wasn’t thinking anything, which was a mistake, but I didn’t want to outright accuse him of anything. He didn’t come out and ask me directly, you know? Throughout the day, he kept bringing up how he wanted to try Adderall. 

In the 3 years we’ve been together, I’ve never been given any reason to feel distrustful of G. He is a good, honest man. I’m also an anxious person, and the thought popped into my head: “what if he steals from you?” It’s an irrational thought and not one I would normally have, but once that popped into my head, it’s been chilling in the back of my mind. I feel guilty even thinking it. 

If he brings it up again, should I straight up tell him I’m not going to give or sell him my medication? I don’t want to be presumptuous, but this is a little red flaggy to me. I’m just not sure how to word it or broach the subject myself if need be. I could really use some advice on this. If the comments really were innocent, I’d feel so terrible.  Also, I’d love to know if I’m just overreacting and blowing this way out of proportion. Thanks!

Tl;dr: since I was prescribed Adderall last week, my bf keeps bringing up that he wants to try Adderall. Am I being presumptuous in assuming he’s hinting that he wants me to give it to him? How can I talk to him without outright accusing him of lowkey asking for my prescription drugs? Thanks!",relationship_advice

t3_chpetd,I’m a surgical nurse &amp; I don’t know how to break things off with the chief surgeon I’m sleeping with without facing repercussions,"I (f, 25) have been sleeping with the chief surgeon from my hospital for a couple of years now. He was recently divorced when I met him, and I was fresh out of nursing school. So I was really flattered that this rich powerful handsome man was interested in me. 
He has bought me a house, gifts, and even gave me a credit card. 

But the other night he brought up marriage to me, and told me that he would like to have a housewife to cook, clean, and have his children. He asked me if I could see myself doing that. This really blindsided me, I would have to throw my career away and all the work and money I spent to get here would go down the drain. I told him “maybe but not anytime soon”. And then he laughed and told me that if I don’t accept his offer then I am “dumber than he thought”. 

I told him I would be dumb to throw away everything to be a stay at home mom at 25. And then he just threw a curve ball at me that me really feel trapped. He put his hand on my upper thigh and told me, “don’t make me take this matter into my own hands, I’m giving you a choice”.

I knew exactly what he meant, that he will fire me. 

I got really chocked up and tried to tell him not to put me in this position, but he shushed me and told me he will give me a few days to tell him my decision.

I don’t know what I can do. I can’t report him, because I am equally as guilty. And he would be my only reference for a new job, and he wouldn’t give me a good one on these terms. 

I feel so naive and used. I should have known this was a bad idea but I didn’t expect him to treat me this way. Please help me. I’m between a rock and a hard place.",relationship_advice

t3_chp4hy,Cheated on my GF [22] with one of close friends [22] and i have fallen in love with her,"First off, I know how bad this sounds and I do agree its the most prick-like behavior imaginable. I haven't gotten over the fact that it happen and how I stooped so low and caused so much hurt to the girl I claimed I loved. I also apologize for the length of this post, but all the details here are crucial.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 22\[M\] and have been with A \[22,F\] for a year and 6 months now, we met in uni and have had a very healthy relationship up to this point.

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory: My gf, lets call her A has been friends with B for about 4 years now. They started hanging out in their first year of Uni and got really close due to the fact that they had a lot of similar interests. B is what i would describe as a walking mess. She's selfish, a real kiss ass and a serial user of the victim card. A on the other hand is the girl next door, kind to everyone she meets, willing to drop everything to help anyone, loving and the most loyal person i know. A has been there for B through her fair share of breakups, panic attacks, university competitions and just general life. B on the other hand, claims to care and says the right words, but never actually backs it up with any real action or care.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have known B for 3 years and have been her trainer and later partner in various national competitions where we represented our uni. I'll be blunt here, I never liked B and was short of being hostile to her. I have told A many times that B is a toxic friend and A brushed it off as me being angry with no solid reason. B has always been intimidated by me (she later admitted this) but has never noticed my distaste of her( she admits she's the densest person alive).

Fast forward to about 2 months ago and the 3 of use have just graduated uni in the UK. A had to go back to our home country to take care of her dad who recently had a minor operation and was resting at home. Before she left, A and B had made arrangements to stay at my place as B's boyfriend (a good friend of both A and myself) had also gone back to his home country to spend time with family. A offered the place that i share with her from June 2019 to the end of July 2019 to hang out whenever she wished and told me that i should invite her over for meals and just to keep her company as she was feeling lonely.

Before leaving, A told me to keep my walls up and to make sure that i did not do anything stupid. Her reasoning was simple: B and I are two very similar people and if conversations were to take place, we'd both realize that we are in fact the same person. I brushed it off as her being overprotective and said that nothing would happen. She did make me promise that if anything did happen, i would tell her immediately to which i agreed.

A left for home on the 29th of May 2019 and B arrived back in the UK on the 31st from holiday. I invited her to dinner at my place on the 1st as per A's request and B accepted. We talked but always kept our distance and made sure nothing went past small talk and conversations on life and our future studies. We said goodbye and agreed to meet up the next day to get some groceries. The 2nd and 3rd of July went by pretty uneventful with the only highlight being that she had to move out of her accommodation and i helped her move her belongings to my house in the mean time.  On the 4th of July after helping her move her things once again, she went to rest in A's room which A had given her to stay while she was away. I brought her things upstairs and headed for the door when B asked me to stay and talk to her for a second. I obliged and we just chatted about life and future plans. She then told me about her past relationships and some details about her childhood. I am a secretive person by nature so i did not divulge much personal information about my private life to her. B then told me about a traumatic incident in the past where she was molested by a elderly relative (this part will be important later) I sympathized with her and told her it was in the past and that she is in a better place now. B then became affectionate and touched my hand and thanked me for being understanding. We ended up talking for hours and became really close and open with each other. She then asked me if i could massage her shoulders as she was feeling sore from all the moving. I took this as a red flag but decided that it was a harmless massage and decided to just do it. Things did escalate from there, and I ended up massaging her butt and thighs. No sexual contact was made and we both went to bed at 5am.

&amp;#x200B;

On the 5th, i had to run some errands in the city and only got back around noon, B opened the door for me and greeted me in her pajamas while on the phone with A talking about how B is so lazy to go out even though she wants to run her own errands. I smiled and headed to my room to settle down and game. B entered my room an hour later and asked me about my day before lying down on my bed. I made small talk with her while playing my games. She then came over and asked what i was doing and i offered her my laptop if she wanted to play. She accepted and ended spending 30 mins playing CSGO. B then decided to leave to A's room and asked me to follow her, which i stupidly did. She ended up asking me to cuddle her, to which i stupidly said yes, thinking it would not escalate. We ended up going back to my room as she didn't wanna ""do anything on A's bed"". In my room, i kissed her neck and felt her up as she asked me to list all the things i wanted to do to her. I ended up fingering her as she asked me to go harder. After that, we both took a deep breath and realized what we had just done. She was pretty chill at first before spiraling into guilt and regret. I told her that we should tell our respective partners to which she agreed. As A and B's bf were sleeping, i suggested we call them first thing in the morning and B agreed. I wanted to take that opportunity to call my parents and tell them what transpired ( i tell them everything and rely on them for advice and guidance). We went to bed in our own rooms. Waking up the next day, my phone was filled with messages from A asking me what happened. Apparently B had told her bf who then told A to call B. B then told A that something happened between B and I but did not divulge any details. I called A and told her the complete truth. In the next few days, i found out that B had told A a heavily biased version of events, telling A that i had molested B and she did not consent to anything. B told her bf the same thing. A then realized as i told her the full version that B had lied about most aspects and omitted a giant chunk of the truth. A told me to be careful and to gather any evidence i could to prove it was consensual. B and I stopped talking for a few days, and she began to bitch about me to A, telling her i was a psychopath that was only using her for gratification. She even likened the entire experience to her traumatic experience with her relative.

&amp;#x200B;

Understandably i was furious that she was crying molestation when i made sure to confirm with her multiple times if it was consensual to which she agreed. B's bf talked to A and ranted about how i took advantage of B. All this made A mad at B and she eventually decided to fix things with me, much to the chagrin of B and her bf. I called B and apologized for my role in everything as she scolded me for acting like psychopath. B later called me and admitted that she had a crush on me and it developed when we talked. She then headed to stay with relatives for 2 weeks

Fast forward 2 weeks and B and I are fine, with her admitting she wanted it and instigated the entire incident. She then became super affectionate towards me, giving me hugs and following me around the house. She admitted that she really had feelings for me and couldn't explain why. During this time A and I were on a break, B knew about this and took advantage of this, giving me neck kisses and acting cute around me. Nothing happened for the  few days she was there and she then left for  relative's house to stay for 4 days. When she came back again, this time around the 23rd of July, she was full on affectionate. After helping her carry her luggage to her room, B pushed me all the way back to my room and then shoved me onto the bed before making out with me. Throughout the week, we had sex once and went down on each other a few times.

B then left for Europe for a week on vacation and constantly texted me with updates on her day along with selfies of herself. It was then that i told her that i wanted to fix things with A and didn't wanna continue the fling we had. B got mad that i suddenly sprung this on her but agreed that it had to happen. When she returned to the UK on the 3rd of July, she was professional and civil with me for  2 days. From the 5th onward, we relapsed and slept with each other 3 more times in between making out and cuddles.

&amp;#x200B;

A was due to return on the 16th of July and B had to leave for another holiday with her mother on the 13th. It was a very sad day on the 12th  as B kept wishing things were different and wished she could be with me. I told that i felt the same way but i really couldn't do it to A. She agreed but we both spent the night in each others arms, almost crying. On the 13th i sent B to the bus stop as she was heading to London. As she ran to catch the bus, she shouted ""I love you"" and boarded the bus. I was taken aback and smiled before heading home. She called me 10 minutes later to apologize for those 3 words, saying that she really doesn't feel that way and that it was a slip of the tongue.

The 14th and the 15th were rather weird days, as she finally admitted that she did fall in love with me and wished we could have been together. Not once did i reciprocate by telling her i loved her too as i felt that would be a step too far and i genuinely did not feel that way for her. When A came back, B told me to delete all the texts with her in order to avoid A finding out. B also said that she would not text me anymore to avoid suspicion. When A came back she was happy to see me, but was still hurt by what happened.

When B came back to stay in the house from the 19th to the 21st of July with her mom, we didn't talk. I tried being civil with her but she was rather rude. In response, i completely blew her off and ignored her throughout her stay. During this time, A alerted me to B's tweets which were sub-tweets about how she had to walk away even though her feelings towards me were stronger than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings us to today, where i am genuinely torn as to what to do. I looked deep inside and realised i may have fallen in love with B and i know she still feels the same. Its a tussle between heart vs head at the moment but i know deep inside i will be making the biggest mistake in my life by leaving A and going with B

&amp;#x200B;

A summary of the both of them:

A:

\- Kind, gentle and a genuine soul

\- Has helped me many times when i was unable to buy food and pay rent

\-  blames herself for the entire saga

\-  has self esteem issues as she is slightly on the bigger side but is a beautiful girl

\- feels inferior to B as B is thin , pretty, and very smart

\- loves me to death

\- wife material

&amp;#x200B;

B:

\- selfish, condescending and manipulative

\- has a fake persona in front of others to get them to like her

\- hates men due to her parents being divorced

\- a compulsive liar and genuine douche bag

\- shows no remorse over her actions

\- very self confident on the outside, but lonely and sad on the inside

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like the easiest decision to make but why am I torn? I genuinely love and care for A and see a long term future with her. As for B, i don't think i could ever consider a long term relationship as she is genuinely a toxic person but somehow i am in love with her. I don't know what to do, even though inside i know that i should get rid of B and fix my relationship with A. What do you guys think? How should i approach this?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S : A does not know about any of the things that happened  (i.e, the making out, sex, etc) after the initial cheating incident \*(5th of July) I am too scared to tell her knowing that I would seal the death sentence on my relationship with her. I plan to tell her eventually, when we decide to take things to the next level.

P.P.S: I have screenshots and recordings of all my texts and phone calls with B so i have hard evidence that everything was consensual and that she admits to having feelings and falling in love with me. A knows about the screenshots but i have not shown her the screenshots from the 13th of July to the 15th where B and I admitted to wanting to be together.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR : I cheated on my gf with one of her close friends. We have now fallen in love with each other but she is an extremely toxic person. I have fallen for her but i dont want to ever lose my gf as she is an angel. What do i do?

&amp;#x200B;

DISCLAIMER: I regret my actions and these past few days have really cemented the fact that i messed up. I do not want to justify myself as there is nothing to justify. I want to do better and i want to make it up to A. I dislike B with a passion yet find myself in this predicament. I dont want to be with B, but i have feelings for her.",relationship_advice
t3_ch7jfk,I [28M married] have a taboo crush on my best friend's girlfriend,"  

Hello, fellow redditors! I want to start by saying that this was very hard for me to write, as I am oficially admitting to this crush (to you and to myself). Throwaway because some of my friends know my username.

I am married to my wife for two years, although we've been together for more than 10 (highschool sweethearts). I am happy in my marriage (or so I thought) and I love my wife very much.

However I recently developed a crush for my bestfriend's (let’s call him Robert) girlfriend (will call her Mary). Although they've been together for more than 3 years and I've known Mary since then, I never looked at her ""that way"". She is really hot but I never felt attracted to her, or to anyone else besides my wife for that matter.

The only reason I can find for me having this crush is that lately I've felt that my wife is somewhat absent when she comes home from work and I've felt lonely more than a few times, despite being next to her.

So, a little story of how this crush started: About a month ago I've met with Robert and Mary at the seaside. I was on a half business half fun holiday, and they've decided last moment to join for a couple of days. 

During their first day, I've met them at the beach and we spent some hours together just chilling and talking about various stuff. Nothing unusual so far, but the problem was that I had to make conscious effort to avoid looking at her every two seconds or to avoid staring at her perfect ass (that she may have wiggled on purpose when she suspected I could be looking). I was wearing sunglasses so I just stared for that sweet 3 seconds, pretending to light up a cigarette. Later that evening, I had to return to my hotel because I was supposed to meet some friends. I asked Robert if they wanted to join and sure enough they said they will. By the time they arrived, I was at the beach with some friends. Although Robert and Mary only spent 1 hour with us, there were some things that kept the fire going. She even held my hand to show me something (not sure what exactly, as I was pretty drunk) and I felt something... something that although I higly enjoyed, felt so wrong.

Fast-forward to us coming back to our hometown, to celebrate my bestfriend's birthday. Nothing worth mentioning happened there, except when it was time to say goodbye, I refrained from hugging her as I usually do. Getting home and putting myself to sleep I started regretting not hugging her. It was that moment that made me realize this crush is about to get serious.

And oh boy, was I right: The next two weeks (up until now) I've had big problems sleeping, I couldn't stop thinking about her, replaying in my head all the little moments we've had (like the hand touch at the beach), but more important I started fantasizing about her, and dreamt about her almost every night since then.

I've waited for 1 month to post this because I was hoping my feelings towards her will pass (In more than 10 years with my wife, I've had like 2-3 superficial crushes which went as they came: all of a sudden, no scars left). Unfortunately, the feelings are still there, and the desire is getting stronger and stronger. I never cheated on my wife and I intend to keep it that way.

I've tried coming up with solutions to transform this crush into something positive. For example, I started being friendlier and more helpful with my bestfriend (because I know her happiness is strictly related to my bestfriend's wellbeing), giving him advice (when he asked for it) on how to make her happy or simply sacrificing my time or money to spare Robert’s, so he could be next to Mary. I also started taking much better care of myself lately, using my crush as my motivation. So far so good, everyone is happy, but I am afraid that the time will come when I won't be able to hold this feelings inside, and then all hell will break lose. Not to mention that people will likely start suspecting something is wrong at some point, because all the persons involved (my wife, my bestfriend and her) are very smart and sharp-sighted people.

I've had a very happy and fulfilling relationship with my wife, I love her very much and I can't imagine myself without her, and it is worth mentioning that I never neglected her all this time. But the constant fantasizing about my bestfriend's girlfriend is something I'm not proud of.

Another important aspect is that I suspect she also sees me as more than just a friend, which makes it even worse. I have no proof for what I stated above, it's just what my gut is telling me (I tend to trust my instincts when it comes to these kind of situations). She probably also noticed something different about me, because there were a few times she ""caught"" me looking at her. Just the other day, I was telling a story about one of my friends who years back was having fantasies about someone else while being in a steady relationship. While I was telling the story, when ""hot topics"" came up like ""back in the day, my friend kept telling me: *I cannot stop thinking about her, I dream about us having sex, I look at her and imagine her naked*, I looked her straight in the eye just to release the pressure I felt all the time I kept these things to myself. It was like I could tell her my thoughts, using my friend's story as a cover.

This is also one of the reasons why I posted this on reddit, just to get it off my chest, because not being able to talk to anyone about this drives me crazy.

Please help, I am freaking out over this and it’s eating me up inside. I've got noone to talk to about this. Although I have plenty of friends, there is only one that I trust enough to tell him this story, but he is dealing with his own issues right now and I am not planning on making his life even harder.

I want to make myself clear: Under no circumstances am I planning to act on this crush, all I want is to get rid of these feelings. This crush is indeed lust-driven but I always loved her personality, her energy and her sense of humour. Only the lust is new, and hopefully it will be history soon.

t3_chmgmh,Gf (19 F) doesn't let me (17 M) touch her after argument,"So, me and gf have been together for 11 months, we have a long distance relationship so we've actually been together for Christmas and easter (15 days each) and now that's summer it's nearly a month that we are close.

Yesterday we had an argument : my little brother was in the living room playing minecraft while me and gf were in my room. I wanted to have sex and she didn't because she was afraid he could hear us. After a while I just told her to fuck off (not for real, but I can't really translate what I said). We didn't speak for a few hours and I confronted her in the evening.

I told her that I was wrong and I shouldn't have said that, but she is too passive and never took the initiative. When we started texting she said that she was an animal, and I kinda liked it but in 2 months we've been together she never ever took any kind of initiative, she claims I should have told her sooner, but I told her time and time again.

She complained that I am overaffective, and that's true, but I blamed her for being unaffective most times and so on.
We kinda made peace, but she doesn't want me to touch her so I started ignoring her also because we talked about the fact that similarly to sex, I always (and I seriously mean 95% of times) had to be the one starting a conversation when we are apart, to the point that I just disdn't want to text her anymore.

She says I should have said it sooner, but I did (Didn't put too much emphasis on it, I don't want her to text me because I said her to, and I don't want to have to ask for an hug to get one everytime)

t3_chjhs7,"Me: (30), Boyfriend: (59), Boyfriend Upset Over Miscommunication, Acting Like a Child, Deliberately Obtuse, Blaming Others for his own decision, and Thinking Ill of My Friends for No Reason, Should I Break Up With Him?","I'm a gay man. My boyfriend, we'll call him Ralph (not real name) and another gay couple I am friends with went to a concert in the park recently in my home town.

One of my friends suggested leaving the concert early to get a better table at a nearby bar. He said the good songs were over at that point. Earlier that day he had suggested leaving early to give my boyfriend and I time to get to his house and still have time to join us for cocktails. But my boyfriend and I had talked about it and had decided that since my boyfriend doesn't drink he didn't want to join us for cocktails and he also decided that I could visit later in the week instead and to spend time with my friends and have cocktails because as he said (though in retrospect I am doubtful that he actually meant it) he appreciates that it's important to me to spend time with them. I tried to convey this to my friend that we were no longer planning to spend the night together and Ralph wasn't going to cocktails, and so why not wait until after the concert? My friend said there would still be better tables if we left early. Ralph had expressed that he wasn't enjoying the concert all that much earlier and I wasn't sure what he wanted to do. I suggested that even though he doesn't drink he could have a burger but he said ""we talked about this you know I can't go to the bar"" and then I asked if it would be OK if we left early for the bar. I had thought he had heard my friend talk about how he could get a better table. He said ""OK. Just go."" In retrospect that phrasing sounds reluctant or even sarcastic, but I was at a noisy concert and I have trouble reading between the lines in the first place.

Later on he's upset. He says he never heard my friend talk about getting a better table. He says he wasn't being sarcastic when he said that thought but rather was ""Trying to keep the peace"". I told him he still made his own decision and can't blame others for that, and that he needs to be more assertive.

This is what he said a couple of times in different ways:

""the assertive Ralph will be coming out. No caring about feelings pure bluntness. I will always think of myself first."" He said this even after I said I just meant saying something like ""I rather us stay until the end."" He was being deliberately obtuse and over and over again acting like he didn't get what I meant by ""assertive"", or maybe this reflects a black-and-white view of the world where you are either a pleaser and a pushover or a jerk.

I am angry that he thought it would cause a ""rift"" (his words) had he said he wanted us to stay. There is no reason for him to think ill of my friends like that. I am also angry that he said ""OK"" and then still got upset. In my opinion even if you don't like the decision you express you still expressed it and you have no one to blame but yourself for making it.

This also upsets me because he's about 30 years older than I am, and yet I'm the one acting like an adult and he is acting like a child.

we’ve broached the subject of an open relationship but i just am not okay with it. he’s told me in the past monogamy is realistic or something along those lines. he makes me feel bad about myself for wanting to have a monogamous partnership and tells me i’m closed minded bc i won’t be in an open relationship. he also claims i am stopping him from being who he is

t3_chke6v,My girlfriend [F54] throws hatrid at me [M19] on a daily basis,"I live in a two-bedroom home with my girlfriend and we have been together for just for over a year now. Up until about a month ago, all was going as a relationship does, (and should) however over the past month her moodiness has taken a drastic turn, so much so that it is almost 'sadistic'. She takes every chance to insult me and has lost all trust for me, for no good clear reason. I took me a while to realise as I'm not at all used to being with women of her age bracket, but I think that menopause is the reasoning for this sudden change in behaviour. At the time of typing *this,* it is in the early morning hours of the 22nd of July, and the publishing of this will likely be some days later, this sporadic choice of time to type this is for good reason, as she no longer trusts my presence on the internet, that ""men of my age are the sole purpose for corruption on the internet"" and that I will be no part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I can tell, nothing I've done has triggered this negative mindset of her's, but I feel that there is a point at which the situation far exceeds *just* *the hormones* to blame. This side of her is a side I've never experienced, at the moment I'm trying to give her some time to herself, perhaps this phase will pass, or perhaps I may become so desperate that I have to resort to couples counselling (I always hated that idea). I'm quite inexperienced in the relationship aspect of life when compared to her, is this something that is normal? is she sick of me? Perhaps it has nothing to do with her age at all, and may be just a normal part of the human emotion cycle.

So I finally got the explanation from him yesterday. Turns out he was in a Discord server chat where the members all dare each other to humiliate themselves by doing outlandish things in public they'd never normally do. 

He told me he's left the group because the experience was really stressful to him. Not ""exciting"" like he'd thought when he joined. It was the first time he'd taken one of the dares. He said that afterwards he ""just didn't know what to say and couldn't believe he'd actually done it."" 

He was extremely apologetic for acting like a lunatic causing me to worry about him. We had a long talk about it last night. I genuinely believe he regrets it. He knows what a stupid fuckup it was.

Not much else to say really, just wanted to come back now that I got the answers. Thank you to everyone who tried to make sense of it in the original post, and who gave me advice for talking with him.",relationship_advice

Since then almost every time we’re intimidate he says it. This went to the point that i scheduled an appointment to get on birth control. I don’t have an issue getting on birth control but i honestly don’t think he understand what I’m gonna put my body through. I’ve explain to him already and he said I should still give it a try. It’s my body at the end of the day but I still understand his concerns. I just feel weird about this , am I being unreasonable?

t3_chj7pr,Marital intimacy help,"Been with my wife for 10 years,married for a little over 8. She is willing for the most part to have sex with me, but it has never felt passionate. 

We have never kissed passionately. It has always been very brief closed lip pecks. If I try to kiss her during sex, she promptly turns her face away and tells me to focus on the task at hand. 

She always tells me she doesn't want any foreplay/orgasms when we start our intimate sessions (which are once a month or so) but I often press the issue and 30 seconds-ish after I start stimulating her she tells me to not stop and goes for at least 10 orgasms before I'm allowed to interpose male parts into the situation. 

Oral sex is completely off the table either way. The though of giving me a blow job is revolting to her, and the thought of me going down on her is a complete no go. If I try, she cries and runs out of the room. 

I love my wife more than anything in this world. She is an impeccable mother and caring wife in all areas outside the bedroom. I would rather live a celibate life with her, than pursue anything without her.

We fight very rarely and when we do, are quick to make amends and move on. This is not a post intended to slander my wife, or make myself seem like a victim, simply looking to see if anyone else has been through something similar and has found success through whatever means

Not necessary to read this. 

Me and my ex (from 5 years ago) rekindled things recently.
I booked tickets to meet her.
Now after a minor tiff, the negative emotions came back and haunted her and she ended things.
Making it clear that the one day fight had shown her that it was a mistake to even consider us again. 

It's a domestic flight so on a cancelation, I lose 84% of the amount paid.
Postponing tickets or changing locations is also similarly expensive as hell. 

So I'm fucked.
I have no reason to go there unless she meets me.

We've stopped talking to clear our heads.
Will talk over the weekend.

What do I do now?
How do I convince her to atleast spend time with me when I'm there..

Any advice will be sincerely appreciated. Thank you.

t3_chka1h,A dilemma on me (30sM) leaving my current life behind and moving to a new city for my girlfriend (30sF),"So, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. But anyway, I met this girl about half a year ago on an online dating site, and we hit it off instantly. We both like mostly the same things, like the same type of music, movies, fandoms, etc. We met soon after and it was a great start. We became a couple almost instantly, really. She lives in a big city, while I live in a small town a few hours away by car, so I mostly go visit her on the weekends. Now, I like this arrangement. I don't mind that it's a bit expensive, and we've had a lot of fun together so far.  


The problem I'm having now, though... is that I know she wants me to move to the city to be near her (not to live with her immediately, but to try to live near her at first). I currently live in my own house that I inherited from my family, and I kinda always imagined myself living here. I made my life so far here and since I've been single for a while before I met her, I settled a bit. The issue is, she said she could never live in a house, or outside of a big city. At the time I felt like I can eventually move, as it felt a bit exciting, but recently we've been looking at job postings there and I started feeling somewhat... trapped. Not trapped as in trapped in a relationship, but trapped like a deer staring and a pair of headlights and the car that's about to hit me is this massive change in my life. I know she means well and I do like her, but I never lived in the city, and I don't know many people there as all of my friends are here. I currently have an OK job that could pay better, but it pays well already, so starting fresh at a new place is a bit daunting as I've been here for a few years now. And I do already have a house, so I'm not sure what to do about it. She said she doesn't want to wait too long for me, so I'm feeling a bit of pressure alongside the other feeling.  


So... how should I approach this? I really like her and I want to be with her, even though some of our life goals don't quite align, but it's something we potentially can compromise.",relationship_advice
t3_chk8po,"I'm in a relationship that I'm not sure I want (Me 18F, him 18M)","I have always had more male friends than female friends. I have never felt a ""crush"" on anyone, celebrity nor people my age. I always told myself I would focus on my studies and not date until after high school. In the past, some of my male friends have expressed interest in dating me, but I always politely turned them down. Until this guy.

I have a bad memory so I'm not 100% on the details, but nearing the end of 12th grade I started getting the feeling that one of my best friends liked me. He had recently broken up with his long-distance girlfriend because she cheated on him. Just before finals week, I asked him about it and he admitted he is interested in me, though was waiting to tell me until after finals so I wouldn't have another thing to stress about. After finals and the end of high school (mid/early June), I ended up agreeing to giving a relationship with him a try, because my school excuse had finally expired and he's a really nice person who I get along with well. I have almost no physical attraction to him. I agreed on the relationship on the condition that no one else know, because I am definitely not ready for the social aspects of the relationship, but the ""him"" aspects of the relationship I was willing to give a try.

Before saying yes, I had tried to do research. I always felt that if I was even in love with someone, I would know it, but then I wondered, maybe I wouldn't know it? I googled how do you know if you're in love, and it seemed like I had signs of loving him.

I have never enjoyed hugs, even from family members like my mother and sister, it's just not my thing, but he really likes hugs so I was willing to give that a try for him too. I kept giving him mixed signals and confusing and upsetting him. I was so confused about everything and I didn't know what I wanted. I wanted to make him happy and I wanted to give the relationship a shot, but I also was perfectly fine being single and had no desire to be in a relationship. Or maybe I did want to be in a relationship a little, I was and am very confused about my own feelings, which confused him even more. But whenever he asked, I always answered I still wanted to give it a try, and I didn't want to break his heart.

He had to leave for army basic training soon, so we spent a lot of time together in the few weeks before he left. The relationship escalated from ""I love you"" to hugs to kissing on the hand, no actual mouth kissing, and I admitted that it was going too fast for me and I wasn't entirely comfortable. Like I expected, he felt really bad about it, and I felt bad for making him feel bad. It went back down to hand holding and ""I love you"", though I was never sure if I 100% meant it. Yeah I care about him, but I don't know if it's really love.

He is 100% entirely in love with me, and though I'm trying, I just don't feel the same way back. There's no ""spark"" or anything for me. There is nervous excitement though. I guess I'm not sure what love is like. He told me that he has decided he will never love anyone else again after me, which makes me feel even worse. If I do break up with him, he will be miserable and alone the rest of his life, and it will be my fault.

He went to basic training, and we were able to communicate a little bit at the beginning but then he had to focus on army stuff. In the weeks he's been gone, I've been thinking on my decision more, and I really, really regret it. I have no way of contacting him at the moment so I can't break it off right now, and even if I could contact him it would be horrible to do that to him since, in the contact I had with him, he said he thought about me every day and I helped him get through the day or something.

I recently found out that he is getting medically discharged and is coming back home, because it would be unsafe for his health if he continued training. He apparently has major resting anxiety and heart problems or something like that. I really want to talk to him about how I feel, or rather how I don't feel, when he gets back, but he's so excited to see me again and it would be awful for him to come home and immediately get crushed. On top of that, what if I kill him? What if I literally break his heart, he can't handle the stress, and because of the heart problems he gets seriously injured and dies? In the future, who knows maybe I would want to try again, but that can't happen if he actually dies.

I don't know what I have gotten myself into, and I am scared. I don't like trying new things and I don't think I really wanted a relationship, but I am a person who is very easily persuaded, especially in situations where I don't know anything. I think I want to break off the relationship, maybe not even permanently, just until I feel like I'm ready to be in a relationship, but I don't want to hurt him. I know that probably isn't possible at this point.

We share so many interests and future goals, I love spending time with him, and he seems like a good fit, but I don't think I feel anything beyond friendship for him. I guess I may be bad at judging my own emotions? There are physical aspects to him that I don't find particularly attractive, but that isn't a major concern for me. He's such a great person, honestly his personality is perfect in every way, but I am not ready for a relationship and I shouldn't have let myself get persuaded into one. I know he had no ill intentions, he genuinely loves me and wants to be with me, and I agreed to this. I wanted to give him a chance, and he said that a romantic relationship is a way to take a really really good friendship to the next step.

I have been considering my options for a while now, and just decided to post on here to hopefully get a little help from someone who knows more about romantic relationships than I do. I could break up with him in person the moment I get time alone with him when he gets back. I could break up with him through call because if we were hanging out physically, breaking up would probably end the good mood of the get-together and he probably wouldn't still want to hang out anymore, and the whole thing would be so awkward. I could break up through text because I am much better at getting my point across through typing than talking. I could just keep trying to make the relationship work and hope I develop feelings, but reading through this comment thread

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cgsiov/when\_did\_fake\_it\_until\_you\_make\_it\_backfire/eukzd0k/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cgsiov/when_did_fake_it_until_you_make_it_backfire/eukzd0k/)

made me think that it might not ever happen. I could wait and see what the best course of action is after he gets back (in an unknown amount of days, probably close to a week). I could break up with him just before I leave for college with the excuse of not wanting a long-distance relationship. I just don't know, I'm so indecisive. I don't want to lose his friendship, but I don't know if continuing in a relationship where I feel like he loves me more than I am capable of loving him right now is a good idea.

Another problem (slightly unrelated but still relevant to the relationship causing me stress) is our other friend (18M), who has been feeling very depressed lately. Over time, the guy I am currently dating and I have seen that this other friend would be very not-okay with me dating this guy. We don't know exactly why, though the guy I am dating thinks it's because other friend also romantically likes me. Other friend has told me he doesn't see me in that way, and I want to believe him, but it doesn't answer why he's uncomfortable with me dating this guy. Guy I'm dating and I had been talking about when we would eventually tell people we were dating, and the topic of the other friend came up, and we are kind of worried he would hurt himself if he found out (other friend has mentioned hurting himself before, but then always says it's resolved and he's not going to, but it's still scary). Right before other friend's graduation party, he actually did ask us if we were dating, and after an awkward pause and a glance between us, I said no we're not, because I still am not comfortable with people knowing we're dating. I feel extremely guilty lying to one of my best friends, but I am also uncomfortable with telling someone I'm dating someone, and it would have ruined his mood for his grad party if we said yes.

Part of me wonders if I am asexual or aromantic. I've seen these labels on the internet, and considering I have never felt attraction towards someone and never had a crush, I'm starting to think they might fit me.

Half of me wants to break up with this guy and never tell anyone we dated, and possibly get back together when I'm actually ready for a relationship. The other half just wants to wait it out, and hopefully I eventually develop feelings for this guy who is 100% in love with me. Part of me DOES want to be in a relationship with him, because I really like him and I want the relationship to work, but I don't know what I'm doing and I kind of feel like I'm faking being in love with him because I want to be in love with him, like he is with me. I don't want that to hurt either of us in the long run. I don't know if I'm ready for a relationship. I'm so confused.

I know I wrote a lot, it's just a complicated situation and I don't know what I'm doing. I probably wrote too much, but I wanted to explain it all.

My parents live with my sister and BIL along with their two daughters (my nieces).  I have two kids and we live far away, like another country far away.  My parents, who are in their 70's, are not talking with one another. My dad has done some shitty things over the years, and my mom has had enough and doesn't want to live with him anymore.

He recently was shipped over to where we are because my mom and sister needed a break from him and during that time I have told him what the situation is.  At the time, he seems to be agreeable and is willing to apologize and do what it takes to mend the relationship.  But when he went back after a couple of months he acts as if nothing has happened and has not said much, let alone apologize. Neither of parents want to deal with their problem and it seems like they're just looking for someone to solve their problems for them.  So my sister and her family are in the middle of all this tension, and they're at their limits as well. She thinks the best thing to do now is to separate them. She's found a retirement home for my dad and my mom (who is suffering from depression and anxiety issues) will continue to live with my sister.

This bring us to why I'm here.  My sister called me and told me about the situation, and to put my dad into a retirement home, she's asking that I help out with the finances to put him there.  About $500 a month in perpetuity.  My wife is not willing, which I can understand.  Our marriage was not something my parents were too happy about.  I was helping with my parent's finances before I met my wife, and after my now wife learnt about this, she didn't want that to continue after we married as we were looking to start a family and we should be putting our finances towards that goal. My wife has been respectful and polite to my parents over the years, but she's not happy that over the 9 years we've been married, my parents or sister never called us once just to say hi or ask about her or the kids.  So she doesn't want to just ""roll with it"" and fork over $500 a month. $500 a month is not a small ask, but to her it's more about the principle of things.

Like I said, I understand where she's coming from, but at the same time, I don't want this financial burden to be put completely on my sister.  I asked my sister what would happen if I can't contribute.  Her answer was she would sell the condo they're living in and use that to fund my dad's retirement home.  I feel bad that she and my BIL have to bear the brunt of it all, financially and emotionally, but I also don't want to lose my marriage over this as well in order to help my sister out (my wife and I discussed this situation. and divorce is a likely outcome if I do decide to help despite her objection).  Please help, I'm really conflicted right now.",relationship_advice
t3_chlzy9,Friend keeps doing stupid things around women but he doesn’t learn and won’t listen to me when I tell him to cut it out.,"Ok so my friend, M, is a fairly lonely guy. I’ve known him for about maybe 4 months and some time before that he was bullied and isolated in school. I met him at a party and he seemed like a funny guy. We’ve been talking over snap chat almost every day since. He immediately seemed clingy but I don’t have any other close friends so I didn’t mind that, we got along pretty well.

Then about a month after I first met M there was an acid sesh where I tried acid for the first time. I was on 400+ug and couldn’t tell left from right and was a little freaked out so went to find a friend. I ended up sitting on the sofa with M. And then he asked me out. I realised I’d probably given him the wrong impression and tried to decline nicely. Then he repeatedly asked me out in slightly different ways, I said no each time. Then he tried to guilt me into a relationship by taking about his mental health and I got up and left. He was drunk so I dismissed it

Fast forward to two months later after exams. M is drunk again and whilst a female friend is comforting him, asks her for sex. Attempts to convince her that she should do it for his health and that her boyfriend wouldn’t find out. She obviously refuses. He later tells me  that he hates said friend and tries to make it sound like they had an argument where she was in the wrong. When I find out the truth I try to talk to him about it but he still doesn’t admit that he’s in the wrong.

During this time he’s been talking to another female friend. Flirting sexting etc apparently. We all go to hang out with her and her cousin. Things don’t go as planned when my car starts making these awful ear stabbing noises  and we drive back to her house. He just fucking sulks in the corner, not looking at us. Like how old are you again? I try to get him back into the group but he doesn’t work with me and I just leave him. Apparently it was awkward with the cousin there, but he knew she was coming so I don’t know what he was expecting(cousin was super friendly too). 
This causes a lot of tension and our friend says doesn’t want to talk to him for the next few weeks. I’m also kind of fed up at this point and cancel plans to hang out with M.

He tries to make new plans. Asking me to tripsit him whilst he takes acid. I use the weather as an excuse saying I don’t want to, you’ll overheat, you shouldn’t take it. He ends up taking 2 tabs anyway at about noon. Acid lasts 12 hours but you can pretty much function after the 6th hour. At about seven he tells me he’s going on a walk and he’s gonna do something stupid. Long story short he turns up at our female friends house(walked 2 hours to get there) knocks on her door and doesn’t leave when she asks him to. I don’t know the exact details but it sounds fucked up. He ended up walking to school then to the town centre, back and forth until his mum collected him at about midnight. He wouldn’t fucking listen to me, I was worried he was gonna get arrested if his judgement was as impaired as he claimed it was. 

I don’t really know what to do now. I don’t want to have anything to do with him anymore but he’s unstable.",relationship_advice
t3_chi43e,"My (17F) best friend (17F) dated a guy (16M) about two years ago. Recently him and I have started gaining a crush on each other, can I pursue this?","So for some background, my friend dated this guy for 3-4 months back when we were 15 and he was 14. Since then, I reconnected with this ex (with her permission) as he wanted me to DM his DnD group. I've been hanging with this group for almost a year now. 


Now to the issue, recently this guy and I have obviously started crushing on each other. I have not allowed myself to pursue this out of respect for her, but now I'm finding myself depressed by having to continuously put off a guy I really like. I sent her a message that I want to meet up (to have a conversation about this) but she has not responded yet. 

Here's the thing. She now has another amazing boyfriend, the relationship was two years ago, and it was so short, I guess I might be trying to justify by crush but I feel these are good enough reasons for me to go on a date with him. 

Am I wrong in thinking this? What should I do if she explodes on me for having this crush? Up until now it's been sorta unspoken that he's off limits but idk it's killing me to know I might be missing out on this.",relationship_advice

The police got involved for the first time today, maybe now he understands how severe this situation is and he will not do it again (for real this time).

I stayed abroad for a year, my mom is so excited to meet my first boyfriend that she invited him to our country, payed for his expensive plane ticket and for a family vacation too. I feel so sorry and I don't want to disappoint her. I spent a year thinking about all the things that I want to show him in my country, maybe we can date a few months more and then I will break up with him?

I know deep down that the right thing to do is to break up now but how do I get rid of these thoughts ? He still wants us to date and keeps messing with my head. He said that if I press charges he will kill himself

t3_chk4h3,I (32F) moved to my fiancees (33M) country and we have had issues adapting to each other.,"I (32F) am in a relationship with a (33M), I moved from my home country to be with him, I have a son and now I am pregnant with his baby. My pregnancy has been very challenging as I am sick all the time and was advised to either stay in bed or at least maintain a relaxed lifestyle, I had to stop working due to the sickness and this has affected me as well.

Our relationship started online and we held a LDR for a year before I moved here, we are engaged and we have been living together for almost a year now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship has been in a rocky situation since we arrived and adapting to the new culture and learning a new language has been a bit exhausting and overwhelming for me as well, these are some of the events that have happened since  our arrival:

\- He works in the hospitality industry and he has admitted to flirt with colleagues to make his job easier, he sent a message to a colleague with a selfie and complimented her looks. (when confronted he just said I was overreacting and dismissed my opinion).

\- Whenever I start a serious conversation he constantly dismisses my questions and when I push he says I am trying to control him (e. His spending/drinking/smoking habits). He used to drink heavily and got us into very bad moments, he was able to quit for a while, but lately he drinks every time he has a day off from work.

\- He has no interest in sex whatsoever, I thought that it had to do more with my body changing and gaining weight due to the pregnancy, he assures me that is not the case, but still won't engage in any sexual activity. Due to this I have stopped trying to initiate it. (when  I have tried to discuss the issue he avoids it at all costs or 

\- In the past he has compared me to his previous partners, things such as them being more feminine, or more skilled sexually.

\- Whenever we discuss or fight, he is unable to admit any mistakes, he gives random arguments that don't really connect to the subject and then points everything to me, either me being too negative, not being supportive enough or whatever he can think of.

\-Whenever he messages women, sometime he lies about he is doing, if he is watching a movie with my son, he will say, ""I am working out"", or whatever silly activity he could be doing instead, this leads me to believe that even when these women know about me, he doesn't want to be perceived as he is tied up, or that his actual life is now boring because of us.

He is a great partner most of the time, he loves my son as if he was his own and I do believe he tries, but I do feel like he doesn't really care about my thoughts and feelings, I constantly feel unacknowledged and took for granted. I feel as if he is only happy whenever I don't bring up any important issues into discussion or if I just laugh at his jokes and keep our relationship quite superficial, it seems as if he can't handle any adult conversation as he immediately feels attacked and annoyed. 

His culture is quite direct and cold, so it is quite easy for him to say things such as: I don't want to see you today, I don't want to talk to you, saying I ask too many questions and that I am annoying when I do so, or just getting up and leaving in the middle of a discussion.

I am not perfect and I bet it is also difficult for him to adapt to me and certain aspects from my culture and personality, I can be controlling with some topics such as cleaning and chores, but since he brought them up I have been working hardly to change my way of approaching these, or just doing the activities myself to avoid fights.

Do you think I am not taking care of myself as an individual  by accepting his dismissive behaviour and should I keep insisting on discussing these subjects that are relevant to me, regardless of his annoyance?

t3_chlwkd,Should I [30F] confront my friend [30F] about her Reddit account?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. For the past few months, my friend of more than 10 years has started to develop a toxic behavior, which eventually made me distance myself from her. During our friendship, I occasionally caught her lying about minor things, mostly exaggerating her stories to make herself look cooler/more miserable, but she usually didn't went further than that - or at least, I wasn't aware of it. I've noticed that lately, she's much more active on social media (Facebook groups, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, anything you can imagine), and she posts 10-15 times a day mostly about herself and her lifestyle. That's something that she's never done before and she even criticized people for doing that. As I mentioned, we started to drift apart around the same time this behavior started, and I have to admit that I feel much better without a daily contact with her. I was even ready to move on from this friendship, but then, out of the blue, I saw one of her comments here, and since I didn't know she was even familiar with Reddit, I went to her profile and read her history. I didn't have to scroll too far to figure out that she's a pathological liar: she lies about *everything*, her relationship status, her age, her life, her trips, her pets, and it's not even consistent, it's like she's single in one comment, and she's in a 5-year relationship in another. She also seeks attention and sympathy by posting fake stories about herself, receiving hundreds of comments, awards, all the shit. I'm 100% sure it's her, because she uploaded photos of herself and also shared recognizable details about her personal life.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I really don't know if I should confront her. One part of me tells that it's none of my business and I should just let this friendship go, but I also feel it's really wrong that she's misleading people like that, and she probably even needs therapy. I also have this feeling that I violated her privacy by reading her Reddit history, and I feel very anxious about revealing that to her. I'm kind of stuck in this dilemma, so any help would be really appreciated.

t3_chlvos,Why am I bothered when my boyfriend asks my friend to hang out ?,"My boyfriend (M26) and I (F23) moved to Europe together ( we also work together) and therefore know the same people. I pretty much just have three friends here and my boyfriend just has one buddy. He kept saying that he dislikes my closest friend because he thinks that she is always negative. 

About two weeks ago they attended a dinner for work together. (I was not there) Since he was staying at my place that night, and she lives right around the corner, they traveled home together. 
After that night he completely changed his mind about her and she keeps telling me that she wants to be friends with him as well.(and why I would never bring him to hang out. )

Now my friend keeps asking my boyfriend to hang out and to go to a restaurant they both like. 
He did not really say anything because I could see that it was a little awkward for him. (She asked him like every day, twice).

Last night my boyfriend told me that he will have dinner with her on Saturday. 
I don’t know why but it really bothers me. 
I know that they are really just friends, i‘m not worried that there’s more between them or so. 

I just have the fear that our friendship will change and that she will not be loyal to me in a way. Is that weird ? Does anyone know what I mean ?

t3_chhz1s,"My girlfriend [18F] lied to me [21M], saying that she was 21 also. Only found out after 4 months of knowing her, along with her real first name.","This girl, I love her. She loves me. It's an odd one.

I've never fallen like this for someone before, and I know that she feels the same despite these new revelations.

We met in Tinder, her having her nickname along with the age 21. We messaged and talked for months before meeting one another. We spoke about how she had finished university, ect... All the typical 21 year old stuff.

Eventually we met up and went for a few dates. We connected so extremely well. Since my ex, I have always wanted someone who is capable of an adult, sophisticated relationship which can also just sidetrack into laughing and being silly. My girlfriend is that person. I always commended her on how adult she was for her 'age(21)', seriously! She is so much more mature than I was at her age.

Both of us have difficultly showing our true colours to other people, and that's one of the things we bond over.... The fact that nobody will tolerate us as much as eachother.

And yet I now find out, through phone call of her admitting it to me whilst in tears, that she lied about her age and education. She hadn't even started University yet, she's starting in September. Her reasoning is that to begin with she had Tinder as, as its commonly used for, 'a joke'. But as we spoke more, the worse it got for her to tell. 

I even introduced her to my friends and parents! And she lied to them about her age and education also!. I adore this girl, and I know the instant reaction on herewill be

t3_chlr22,Broke up with an on again off again partner,"We(F26 and M26) met on a dating website and had instant chemistry. We understand each other well, and have a near flawless communication too. And a couple of months later, we started dating. I have always had commitment issues, so I was terrified but after having seen how understanding he was about everything, I decided to deal with them head on and be with him. During this time, we met a couple of times(time constraints because of work)and though it wasn't sizzling chemistry, but those were pretty comfortable dates, imo. I say comfortable because I am very shy in person, and he knows how to respect boundaries very well. However,2 months later he, or rather we, decided to end things because he was in a horrible emotionally downward spiral, and he was having trouble dealing with everything, and I wanted him to deal with this mental health too, over and above everything else. During that time, sometime later, he also said he started having doubts about if he still had feelings for his ex(they hadn't broken up a long time before we started dating, and every time I had asked him if he wanted to try making things work with her, he had said a very strict no). And that was when I was done.
We vaguely kept in touch after that, mainly in the form of sharing funny stuff, and asking about each others' wellbeing.

A month ago, whilst talking and laughing with each other over the phone, we realised we were stil casualy flirting with each other and were still attracted to each other. He also said he wasn't interested in his ex, it was a fleeting doubt and that he was still attracted to me. We decided to start dating again, to give it another shot, and we met again. However, he kind of went cold after that. He is not the kind of person to ghost or leave people hanging, but he thought we weren't having as much of a sizzling chemistry in person, and he wanted to think about it. I got kind of pissed because I was getting tired of constantly waiting on him trying to resolve his doubts, and even him having constant doubts, and him not being open to the fact that maybe it's because we haven't spent much time with each other in person and the only times we've met were in public, and as I said I am pretty shy, that he felt like that, not to mention we hadn't seen each other in quite a few months.

I've been thinking about a major red flag on whether or not I should go through with it and I'd like the community to help. 

She has a mild version of a rare (1/5000) genetic disease called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). This just means her connective tissues are more fragile and elastic, lending to semi frequent dislocations and pain. 

Aside from that, she's also scared to give natural birth due to unknown risk of healing and her chance of full recovery. I've always wanted a couple of kiddos and so does she. We talked about surrogacy as an option, but that seems extremely unnatural to me, not to mention super expensive. 

I'm just worried about the unknown in the future, whether or not her condition will get worse or progressively harder to take care of. On top of that, having the risk of passing the condition onto our kids, if we even have the opportunity to have our own kids.  

Is this a big enough concern or should I go ahead and propose?

t3_chga90,"Best friend found a dating profile of my S/O, and when I confronted him about it, he said someone made a fake account of him","So the other day I (19f) got a text from my best friend that had screenshots of a bumble account that had my boyfriend (21m) of 1 year on it. The account was set up to be him, and the bio used his name, photos, school, and even height. The photos on his account were taken around a month ago. So I showed these screenshots to my boyfriend obviously upset and asking him why he had this account. He then stated that he never made a profile on bumble and someone made a fake account using literally all of his exact information. A couple months ago he did get a email from tinder that someone was using his email for an account, so he said nonchalantly that “this has happened before, it wasn’t me who made the account”
Since my friend matched with his account, she texted me that the account disappeared sometime between the night they matched and the morning right before I told him about it.

The excuse he gave me about the account really throws me off and doesn’t make sense at all, since “they” not only had his pictures, but they had all of his info concerning his school, work, height, astrology sign, etc. But I get really thrown off because if he were to be lying about the profile, that means i wouldn’t of seen him being on a dating app at all for the past weeks despite us pretty much living together, and never leaving to anything by ourselves.

I should also mention that this throws me off because our relationship hasn’t been bad in any means. We’re still highly intimate, have no arguments, and still are highly romantic with each other, so if he were to be going behind my back on a dating website it doesn’t make sense because we’re not lacking anything.

I have no clue on how to bring back up my concerns to him, since we already talked and i took this excuse without thinking about it, and i also don’t want to accuse him of something he didn’t do if he is telling the truth.

So my first question is, how believable is this excuse he’s giving me? has it happened to anyone else? and if the excuse does seem suspicious, how should i bring it up to him and get clear answers on why there was a dating profile of him in the first place?",relationship_advice

Thing is I do not have a great relationship with my parents, because they don't understand or they do not communicate, peaceful or clear enough, and when we get angry, we also get angry because we do not have patience to explain,(my dad doesn't have patience at all). So we argue when we sit at the table (in the last 6 months, we had maximum 3 lunches together, and it was hard, to keep it quiet at the table), we argue when we want to renovate or to reorganise furniture, or arranging stuff in the house. Also keep in mind my dad is a horder ( Communism, made him to be like that, he always compares communism lifestyle with whatever is happening right now. Because he is a horder (he scraps yard sales, and buys stuff we do not need) our lives are affected by that, because the house is transformed in a huge storage room, for mechanics... he is difficult, if i tell him to do something, he postpones everything so hard... if we need to change something right away, he postpones again, and if we try to talk about that he gets aggressive and angry and yells. 

For instance my whole family participated in the autumn garden clean-up, he went to the yard sales and groceries... and when he came back, he was angry, he didn;t know about our cleanup, and then the discussions escalated at the point that he was yelling at me, ( you will get this house and this land, only when i am dead!!!!) - that line was thrown at my face in a such random discussion that i was shocked that he does not appreciate other people's work, or he recognises other work, if he is present there at the point of action, if he is somewhere else, he doesn't recognise that you did chores or any other activities positive to the family. 

So he keeps talking to me like i am a teenager, despite the fact that i pay my staying in the house, i pay the bills, and do chores, he doesn't see me or my boyfriend as adults, we work our asses out, working night shifts and so on. We buy things for the home...we participate. 

So i was telling the hording part, the 2nd floor in my house if full with garbage, living room too, both halls too... he keeps all the junk or shit from the past that we do not need, but he keeps it because it never knows when you need it ( NEVER) - the garden is a mess because he made 3 storage rooms and arent organised, he doesnt let no one to clean the mess, there are rats too... but he doesnt care. .. Further more i keep telling him to do stuff to prevent accidents, and he postpones so hard.... great example yesterday, my cat died in the 2nd floor of the house because i was begging my dad to fix the door and close that space down ....because it is not safe...and postponed so hard that he even had the guts to yell at me because of the cat, my poor sweet cat that died in a shitty context because my shitty dad doesn't understand to fix a shitty door, or if he finishes whatever activity is doing there, he needs to clean and close the place up. HE NEVER DOES THAT...HE LEAVES EVERYTHING THERE. 

I am devastated because of the cat, and because dad doesn;t understand that shit needs to be done in that moment,, not later...because later...is too late. 

I hate him. I didn.t yelled at him yesterday...because i was crushed...cried all day because of my loss.. but I hate him and  his parents (his parents are the worst, keep comparing us to other families, keep hurting us with comments from the past or critics or they try to say information about us but is bogus, arguing and other not so fine moments in my life, they weren;t ok with my parents marriage and they still talk about that for over 29 years, and they keep telling us little stories from the past that are not so pleasant, anything that they are saying is not pleasant) ....

I absolute hate them, they are the worse people. Nothing kind, no love, just pressure, judging and unpleasant conversations bringing the past in the present.... 

1. what should i do with my parents ....?
2. how should i talk to them, reasoning peacefully, (my dad's parents...i totally ignore them, because there is no reason in conversations)
3. i am hurt and crushed about my cat's loss...
4. if you spot other wrong things... please help me with advice. 

Thank you so much. 

I want to do good and to be happy and live peaceful....but instead i get...arguing, tears, loss, and other not so good moments with my parents...

We keep avoiding each other just not to argue. 

I hate him so much because he didnt put his priorities straight with the house. After 21 years the house is not finished....he also doesnt want to sell some land, just to finish the house, and be happy with my mom. We moved in that house in 2004...no electricity, no bathroom no heating...i did my homework at the light of the candles, in the 8th grade...for instance...All the house improvements went so slow....also he refused to sell the land despite the fact it;s value was 6.2 mil eur ....before the 2008 economic crisis... I do not want his house or money. We slept in cold rooms way to many years, and since 2004...we argued about basic conditions in the house... last year we managed to have all utilities but this costed us some fulltime arguing, because i was back home...almost 10 years of my life i spent it living somewhere else because of that. 

They start projects and they are not capable to finish them...

I have a lot of my plate. I had depression, a lot of time ... i;ve just went to work and did my chores... but deep down i was way too down... (sorry about my english) .",relationship_advice
t3_chimqc,My (20M) girlfriend (20F) of two months went on a pretty long tangent about how attractive she finds another guy,"Backstory: We spent the night hanging out at her place with a few of her friends, just sitting around a fire bullshitting. It was two males (including me) and five females (including her). Eventually someone mentioned said guy, we’ll call him Steve. My girlfriend immediately started confessing to her infatuation with Steve. I wasn’t really apart of this conversation, a few of her friends would mention me and my looks of discomfort from time to time, but it was mainly her swooning over Steve while her friends encouraged it. Apparently my girlfriend lived in a co-Ed house with Steve and some other people during a past summer (seems odd).  Some key lines that stick out:

“I would never talk about my husband the way I do Steve.”

“The day Steve hugged me will forever be the best day of my life.”

“Steve might be the second coming of Christ, guess I’m a Christian now.”

She displayed obvious jealousy of his girlfriend at multiple points in the conversation. Eventually the discussion moved on, but I was pretty disassociated for the rest of the night. She mentioned it when I was leaving, but I just shrugged it off and said I wasn’t worried. I still have no idea who Steve is or what kind of relationship they have.

My main issues: She has never spoken about me like this, and I don’t want to bring it up because I’ll look insecure. It just feels disrespectful to have such a conversation right in my face.

t3_chjskp,My partner has been very passive aggressive how do I get him to talk like a civil person?,"A few days ago he found out I was tweeting careless posts, acting as if I was still single. Mind you, we hadn’t made anything official and have been talking for 7 months. Yes I admit I was wrong and I only acted like that bc I would let my insecurities get to me and think it was suspicious of him to not ask me yet given I had found him messaging another girl. 
When he found out he flipped bc we were doing so good. He has  been passive aggressive ever since.

Do you know how when you finally find someone worth risking it all for and you do just that? After a string of from what I can call the hurt and heart break story of my life. I know it's sounds like woe it's me, but I can honestly tell you I've had it all, from infidelity to every type of abuse you can list from previous partners. It took me a long time and a lot of therapy to recover from and years on my own. I found my one. He is truly wonderful when we are together, even when we are apart living the life of LDR when needed for different reasons. When we are doing the long distance it just makes me appreciate him even more. But, yes there is a but! Sometimes, I should identify when he is going through hard times in his life like the loss of a loved one or his own medical issues he just shuts down and there is no contact. This could be a few days or weeks depending on the circumstances. He doesn't like asking for help but I always offer. I hate the no contact. If I'm feeling vulnerable I want him around. I know everyone is built differently and some people need time and space to process. But at what point do you no longer shut the person that you love and respect out and allow them to support you?
Is it normal for someone who is the alpha of their family to shut people out? Not want to show their vulnerable side?
How much space to I give and for how long?

t3_chiktu,Issues with being thoughtful,"Hi reddit. My boyfriend [24 M] and I [20 F] have been going through a strong rough patch lately due to some of my own issues and some of his. 

I have been working in my issues (mental health stuff) for a while and know how to handle them when they cause issues between us. He on the other hand does not know how to handle his issues and thats what I’m here to ask for help with. 

We have been together for a little over two years.  My boyfriend seems to struggle with what we have blanket termed “thoughtfulness” the most. He struggles with thinking about things he says to me and how hurtful they can be, doing small actions that can be see as thoughtful things, and with thinking of things I would like in general. These are all things I do for him and try to explain to him how I am doing it but it doesn’t seem to come through to him. 

I can provide specific examples of these things if needed but I just want to find advice for him to follow that’s not coming directly from me. Just how to work I’m being more thoughtful in all aspects without forcing it.

t3_chjrnx,"My ex told me i was ""controling"" because i aksed questions?! Was I??","Sooo my (M,25) ex(F,24) of 5 months broke up about a month ago. The reason for this was because she thinks we're not compatible. But she said some other things too. Like how i aks a lot of questions. She told me she thaught this was the case in two instences. 

One was when she went to the gym(she started going there rescently) and i asked her what machines she used, if she had fun with her friend and if she and her friend talked about anything spaccific. Dont get me wrong but my intention here is showing interest in your life and nothing else. No hidden scheme. No hidden agenda. Just, ""hey, how was it? did you have fun?"" I wouldnt even be able to tell you why asking these questions is considered controling by her or her friends. And yess, appearently she talked to her friends and they seem to think the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

The other insctence when she thaught i was controlling her was when she sat outside with her mom and a friend one day. I asked If she was having fun and if they had anything new to say. I dont really care what they talked about, im just trying to show interest in your life. But somehow this is controlling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it? Is it controlling to ask questions about how your day went and if the people in your life had anything new or fun or sad to say?? Its not like i keep hammering the same question over and over again either. I ask once every time she does something without me. Did your mom have anything to say this evening when you were sitting in the living room? Did your friends have anything new or fun to tell? I cant possibly comprehend why this would seem controlling??

&amp;#x200B;

Im just one of those people that asks a lot of questions...

I have a feeling someone in her life might have implanted the idea that i was controlling. Her mom always liked me a lot so i dont think its her. She gets guidence from a professional for her aspergers that told her she needed to break up with me before because ""she did not seem happy"" (newsflash, NOBODY IS HAPPY AL THE TIME). And lastly, her friends (i only met two of them and they both liked me) might have been like ""why dont you spend time with us anymore"" and gf blaming me because we had a lot of contact.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe relevent?: 

During this time she also told me that i was the reason she spent less time with friends. We had a lot of contact which is normal during the puppy love beginning stages of a relationship ofc. I always encouriged her to do things with friends multiple times but in our 5 months together she only did this 2-3 times. She always had other stuff to do or didnt want to go or was to tired which is fine to. But dont blame me for something that is out of my control. Your old enough to go have fun with friends yourself. I did stuff with friends during this time. Less then before the relationship ofc but i saw them twice to 3 times a month. So why am i to blame? You are your own person with your own life, do what you want to do and go have fun. I would love it if she did fun things with her friends too.

I asked her multiple times if she was happy and if she wanted to change anything about the relationship. Relationships are dynamic and people change over time so i wanted to make sure we both got what we needed from eachother. She was always happy, nothing had to change, it was perfect! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now she might have been feeling guilty about doing things with friends because i would be all alone then, waiting for her until she got back and we could talk again? That might be what she thought at this time. But im fine without her, i dont mind. I like to do my own thing but i like to do things with you even more. I didnt need her there all the time. I see why she might think this is the case because we talked a lot on whatsapp and i saw her almost every day in our internship where we would spend time together too. But i thought that this was what she liked (i asked her multiple times) and i liked it to so i went along with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

All this happend in 3 weeks. Where i was the love of her life the weekend before, she suddenly broke up with me 3 weeks later. Ofc this happend during a stressful time and it seemed like she did not trust me anymore for some reason (i was always honest and upfront with her) because she was scarred. I tried giving her time and space as best i could during this time because i could feel this was what she needed. It might not have been perfect (remember, we saw eachother every single day so that makes it hard to give that space to someone) but i gave it my all. When i asked her why she did not tell me these things before she told me that she did not want to hurt me or make a scene. But thats not how health communication works. Thats not how relationships work.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for my questions:

Was i controlling??

I have a feeling someone in her life might have implanted the idea that i was controlling. Could this be true?

I think that she felt trapped in the relationship and needed some space but was not able to communicate this with me. Am i wright?

Are these things my fault or is she to blame becaus she did not comunicate propperly?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My ex and her friends think i was controlling because i asked her questions about her and her friends lives to show interest?! Was i??",relationship_advice
t3_chg5y3,"Why can’t I [24/F] trust my bf [28/M], don’t know if it’s my insecurity or gut feelings?","Tl;dr: when my bf and I are together I feel like I am the center of his world. When we are apart I get so anxious about our relationship I want call it off and look for reasons not to trust him. 

I’ll try to keep this organized. My bf and I have been together for about 5 months now, and this is my first healthy relationship (which I think plays a big part in how I feel). 

When we met, he was still living with his ex. After our 3rd date, we slept together. I found it off that he never would invite me over, so I pressed him on why and he immediately explained that he was living with his ex while he looks for a place to live, and they had a dog together. He was hoping to move out quickly and not even have to tell me (he hinted on our second date that he was looking to move to be closer to work.) I explained to him that I understood why he didn’t tell me on our first date, but wish he told me before we slept together and do not feel comfortable being intimate again until he moves out. He understood, apologized, and respected that choice. 

About a month later she asked him to leave (he was dragging to get out of there). During this time he was almost always talking to me, and if he wasn’t at work, we were hanging out. I truly in my gut felt like he was being honest that it was over between them because:

1. He didn’t speak ill of his ex, he says their break up was amicable and that he respects her - they just fell out of love, and he even asked me to help him look for apartments and went to a couple roomate meetings. 

2. He spent literally every single day off he had with me (he works around 50 hours a week)...probably didn’t help him in finding a place. He also recently admitted to me that he never lived on his own, so he’s nervous to take that financial step. 

3. Whenever I asked him things he didn’t get defensive, he’d explain and answer. 

Overall, I felt that I could trust him. She told him he needs to go (she started seeing someone else) and he moved home. Right now, he lives an hour away from me. On his days off he will take one, sometimes two trains to spend time with me. All my friends love him and he even came to a wedding with me where all my coworkers liked him. 

He is so patient with my depression/anxiety, our sex life is very good, and we communicate well. 

So this is where I don’t understand wtf is wrong with me. Lately I’ve noticed a pattern that by the third or fourth day I haven’t seen him, I will start to get irrationally angry with him or get this feeling in my gut like something is off. For one thing, I catch myself constantly looking on IG to see what he is liking. Mostly dogs and art, but there is this one girl who he likes every single one of her pictures. I asked him who she was, and he didn’t get defensive, simply said it was a girl he met at a concert and that they haven’t hung out in years (fine, it’s not like he hides his phone from me or takes it with him when he leaves the room). Another thing I go in circles on in my head is that I am the rebound. His ex and him had not been intimate for months before we met and broke up in November, and yet I get this idea in my head that I’m the girl he cheated on her with. I also get upset that he hasn’t introduced me to any of his friends so I feel like I don’t exist to anyone he knows (his mom knows about me though). I asked him about this, and he explained that he has no problem with me meeting any of them, but realistically he only works and spends time with me and his family. In our entire 5 months, he has gone to one concert with a friend, and seen his best friend twice (his ex didn’t like her, so they are mending their friendship slowly). Almost all his friends and the people he follows are girls. 

The biggest thing is that I feel he rarely opens up to me the way I do to him. He is Mexican, and I know that a big part of his identity is feeling like the “provider” and being a “strong man.” He tells me that he’s told me things he never even told his ex of two years, but still I convinced myself that I feel like I barely know him...

Even as I am typing this, I know that I finally have a great guy and that these are all things brewing in my head. I’m in therapy now and on lexapro, but still I feel like I need to just block him off. I’ll even create these scenarios in my head where he cheats on me or I catch him lying. 

I guess my ask is if anyone has gone through something similar? How did you make it stop? Am I too insecure/not ready to be in a relationship? Do I need to give it more time?

I don’t understand what’s wrong with me, I kind of feel like my brain is damaged goods 😔",relationship_advice
t3_chlj2g,"my new gf keeps seeing her ex, but not just that.","Hello reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

my last month was a total mess, I broke up with my ex, moved out of my flat which I still pay for, so I'm basically homeless (I initiated the break-up and didn't want to throw her on the streets just like that and since she's short on money... Oh hey chivalry ain't dead I keep saying to myself). I really said to myself I have to stay alone for a while and at that moment suddenly this girl appeared, we are both 28, share the same energy in life, same stage in life, we understand each other in almost all important aspects of life (and the body, oh man, fuck chivalry at that point). She's also really fun to be with and beautiful, the chemistry works outside of all levels I have ever had with a girl/woman.

&amp;#x200B;

but,

&amp;#x200B;

she doesn't have many ppl in life, she's gone trough a very rough time of depressions and crippling anxiety, which left her with very few friends and those she keeps very close, one of them is her ex. He lives about 200km from her and they see each other on regular basis, in the way that she visits him and stay for few days they go for a walk with her dog, go on a trip somewhere, watch movies, generally everything good friends does together sometimes, but they extend it to a period of few days... In which they share one bed. Which is like... uh, wtf, omg lol, tell me I'm dumb as fuck now and I will have nothing to defend myself with. She keeps reassuring me they don't have any physical contact, there's not the taste nor hunger for it. Even some of her friends and family (yes I know them) told me they are just friends, but since none of them really have any proof and only her and him knows the truth, i ain't going to blindly believe that. so I just accept it as it is, she either sleeps with him or not, don't care, not now, when my had is mashed potato from past few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, most people would probably saw the red flag and ran away, I decided not to and go for it, leaving me with only one fear and one question in particular.--

&amp;#x200B;

Are they secretly in love with each other, just waiting for the other to make a move?

&amp;#x200B;

She told me they broke up with these text messages

A: ""dude, it's not working out, we can't be together, let's be just friends""

B: ""yeah, I agree, fine""

&amp;#x200B;

She told me, why she can't be with him, he is too shallow, too rational, she is very live person. From what I see, she had a problem with him, not him with her. What if he suddenly realize he's hiding behind a  mask of rationality and falls for her, let the emotions go and give her what she didn't recieve before? What if she's just waiting for this moment?

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever been in  this kind of situiation? .. so far I'm not investing very much emotionally in this, because of these unanswered questions, she also didn't answer them when I asked her other than ""jesus noo, that's bullshit, really, u gotta know him to understand it's not possible for him"". Well quite frankly, I think it might be possible for him and if it is, and he does it... what happens next?

&amp;#x200B;

t3_chigjb,Me (24M) am having horrible anxiety over apologizing to my ex. (30F),"Compared to many other posts on this sub, I understand this isn't the end of the world and I understand the significance of this relationship opposed to others, I've just been stumped for two weeks and don't know how to proceed.

Background info: Me and my girlfriend were together for 8 months, and she had a child with a previous man (not in the picture). We both suffer from mental disorders such as extreme anxiety and depression (who doesn't, right?..)

Of course, things were great at first; unlike many of my friends I wasn't interested in chasing woman, I've had a good career and wanted to settle down for a while now.

One night at a local pub show, I met my (now ex) girlfriend. We instantly hit it off and saw each other Fri-Mon due to conflicting work schedules. We only live about 20 minutes from each other. We always made the best of our time together, and it felt very special (mind you, I've been in healthy relationships that lasted years, so I have a general idea of what love feels like).

Events occurred, revolving around her lying regarding substance abuse. She wasn't sticking needles in her arm, but I expressed to her that I've lost too many friends/family to bear the thought of losing someone else I love, and I'd like the occasional exception to never occur. When admitting to this lie, she expressed a genuine apology and has (last I heard from her) has been doing well.

Things got really rocky from there. We tended to argue, stemming from many insecurities I gathered from that lie as well as previous baggage from a rocky relationship. We broke it off around the 6th month mark.

I stopped contacting her for a week after that, and one day she called me and I admittedly gave in and went to her house to console her and see her because I missed her. She didn't want to be together due to the arguing that led us to where we were, and I continued to be her friend. **I know that was a mistake.** You can't have your cake and eat it, too..

We continued to see each other for another two months. July came - I took her and her son to gatherings from July 3rd - 5th, and we spent a few days enjoying each others company before we both had overtime coming up. A few days later after saying ""Love you, talk to you soon"", we had another argument, and the next day I expressed that it's hard for me to be emotionally invested in someone who can't be emotionally invested in me. She replied with ""I don't think we'll ever be each others puzzle piece, I told you I wouldn't know how I would feel after so long "" among some directed hurtful messages.

I had been dealing with many personal and family issues this week that she wasn't made aware of because i'm horrible at communicating. I ended up getting drunk (I was almost a year sober, but was never a big drinker) and having a meltdown. Not to mention I forgot my medication effects alcohol tremendously.

She texted me again hours later, telling me that she doesn't want me gone but doesn't want to string me along and possibly never reconcile. That's respectable, right? I responded like a prick. I was drunk and so manic that my friend took my phone and said ""Stop texting \*\*\*\*\*\*"". She replied with something along the lines of ""Lol okay mystery person, mind your own business"". The next morning, hungover, I texted her and told her I had to respect that she doesn't think we belong, and I felt hurt, and I hope she's feeling okay. I never got a response, so I mailed her belongings to her a few days later.

It's been two weeks today since she's answered the ""mystery person"" text. I haven't reached out due to my anxiety. I feel like such a piece of shit for some things I said. I have a big heart and I feel so awful I caused such a loving, and beautiful woman the degree of pain to end our relationship. I showed no remorse for the things I said to her and haven't heard back from her in two weeks.

I want to send a clean slate message to apologize for hurting her and how it must've made her feel and that I hope she is okay. I know we didn't work well together, so I don't want to be in a relationship for her. However I have bonded with her and her son quite a lot, we share the same friends, and I'd like us to be able to look at each other in a civil light at least. I've been sitting here for two weeks with an apology text waiting to send. I just don't know how to click send.",relationship_advice

t3_chjnvf,Friendship / Relationship Help,"So my best friend (m) and I (f) have been best friends for over 10 years and back in the day our friendship was based on a typical high school crush... we were both super into each other, but never did anything about it because I was too shy and he later came out to me as gay... guess it all makes sense now! haha He has had gay relationships in the past but has never been in a relationship / not interested to be with a girl. The other day, he mentioned to me that he is completely open to being with a girl and wants to explore this option in the near future... this shocked the bejesus out of me because he is as gay as they come. 

If he weren't gay we would 100% be in a relationship / married because we are so compatible and similar it would just make so much sense... so much so that friends of ours are like can you guys just get married already?! The other day we were looking at engagement rings on instagram (lots of our friends are getting engaged at the moment) and I was like ""oh I love that one""... his response was ""don't worry babe, I'll buy it for you one day, but let me get a promotion at work first so my three months wages will get you what you deserve"". 

I'm very conflicted about what is going on here... is this just him creating a fantasy of a life he would like to live but cant because he's gay or what.... thoughts are appreciated!",relationship_advice

t3_chlfu1,A ton of nudes hidden on bf’s (28m) phone.,"My boyfriend (28m) and I (22f) have been together for close to three years soon. I just found maybe 50 nudes of girls, some of the same girl on his phone. 

They seem like someone screenshotted them on their own phone and sent them to my boyfriend because one of them has that little notification at the top showing that my bf texted them as they screenshotted the nude. Also, three are like a video screen recording of someone going into their Snapchat and recording what a girl sent of herself naked. But why does my boyfriend have this? 

There is also a picture of a girl in a bikini at a bikini car wash nearby and my bf’s work truck (his boss use to go there with the landscaping crew he is on to get the car clean... but it’s weird he would take a picture?) 

Now I find it more funny, weird, and confusing that all these are saved on the files app on his iPhone... so iCloud? But not with his regular photos. Also the date and time on these nudes are all today, a few hours ago, between 2-4 am.

I know my bf will lie when I confront him about this. But am I over reacting? What would you do? I don’t understand why someone would send him nudes of someone else and him save it... which is what I’m assuming is the situation but I may be wrong.",relationship_advice
t3_chlfrm,Irrational desire to sleep with one particular woman,"I've been with Rose for two happy years. 

Unfortunately, I've been cursed with this unholy lust for a girl named Kate years before I even met Rose.

It is completely irrational as I only know Kate through a friend and she lives thousands of kilometers away. Kate and I only had two encounters. Both times we almost had sex but were cockblocked by unforeseen circumstances. 

But Kate and I, since we were teens, have never talked about much else besides sex. And maybe that's why my obsession grows but recently it has become downright unhealthy.

I don't even watch porn anymore. I feel life's greatest adrenaline when I think about Kate. I'm sorry for the details but I literally see stars when I'm done fantasizing about her. But the moment I'm done, I hate myself and want nothing to do with Kate.
 
I wish and pray I wouldn't feel this way but I can't get her out of my head.

So far I haven't let it ruin anything with Rose. Our sex life is good. I could be more honest to Rose about the specific details of my problem with Kate but I basically told her a good chunk of it. 

Rose is very understanding and she said she doesn't know how she might feel if I did sleep with Kate but she wouldn't count it against me as long as I told her. While some may see this as a greenlight, I don't want to see Rose's true reaction when I tell her. I want Rose to be my everything but I also feel this monsterous greed and lust for Kate.

So I'll take any advice on how to be rid of this curse. Thank you so much if you read everything; I had to get it off my chest. I feel like nobody around me has a problem like this and I feel alone.",relationship_advice
t3_chjmf0,I (M20) am having a hard time during break with (F20) Gf,"To start things off, me and my gf lived together for 5 years. We spent almost every single day together, the only time we didnt is when I was in the hospital or when I was away at a friends camp. In feburary we both went to our parents houses, and tried doing a long distant relationship. 

For the most part it was okay, until my insecurities kicked in when she was being distant because of her depression. Admittedly I made the mistake of taking her actions personally and assumed she had to of been talking to another guy because she wasn't talking to me as much. I even ended up trying to pretend I didnt care **about the false scenario i thought of in my head** and saying I would just talking to a girl at the job where I lived ""because shes already been helping"".

I 100% take the blame for my gfs actions because after that she started to distance herself. We eventually ended up talking about things and for the most part I understood her stance. She wanted time to think but still wanted to see me. So although I felt like she put walls up. I believed her saying nothing changed and even though I was an total idiot *and other unkind words*. She still felt the same way. I was learning to deal with my insecurities and distance issues and she was focusing on herself more.

Things were starting to get better until one day we were supposed to hang out and last minute she told me she had to work. I was disappointed but accepted it. Only to find out she went to a rave instead.... before I wouldn't have minded, but she was very adamant about how she felt like raves were for wh*res. We argued for awhile and I eventually accepted this was apart of her finding herself and just trying things.

Then she changed her phone codes.. and my insecurities were brought back up only because now she started having more guy friends. I felt like it was very odd timing and admittedly logged into her snapchat only to find she was now talking to a guy and she ""didnt know how he got her snapchat"". To me that felt like a lie, and it worried me because if shes lying about something so small what else was there. 

I feel like I was wrong to go on her snapchat, but at the time I convinced myself that since shes done it so many times,  I was allowed. Regardless I know it was wrong.

Then she went to another rave but this time wore a very skimpy dress, I bought for her to wear during sex. She convinced me she wore it with a bra and that guys didnt even say anything. I dont believe her. Shes gorgeous and has a really nice body.

Then one night I slept over her house, and in the middle of the night her phone went off. I contemplated for about an hour whether I should look or not. And eventually I woke her up and tried to talk to her about it. It was another guy and this guy sent her a letter Kenney meme. Now this was where it all went downhill. Earlier last year I tried to show her letter Kenny and she was annoyed at how they talk. When I notice she started watching it again this year I asked her what made her watch it she got really defensive.. I didnt think anything of it at the time but it clicked once I seen that. It turns out that guy convinced her to start watching it and now they talk about it all the time since ""he cant talk about it with anyone else"". To me that sounds like another excuse. Only to find out alot of the times when she was hanging out with her friend he was there. 

After weeks of arguing eventually I tried to let it go. And for the most part I did. But now she lives with her friend. I feel like hes there all the time. And I cant talk to her about anything without it becoming an argument no matter how I approach the conversation. It's gotten to the point where shes angrily said she doesnt really care about how I feel anymore. 

After she said that I told her okay, I'm finally at the point where I feel like I can let go. Whatever I had to do to move on I was gonna do and again like every other time I tried to just end the break and move on she said that's not what she wants. It's so hard because she used to be the type of girl to get worried when I said ""I love you"" differently. Now it's seems like she doesnt even want to talk to me all of our conversations come from me starting them. It's gotten so bad I've had to block her on all social media and even snapchat because I would just sit there and watch her score go up. 

I don't know what to do because every night I just cry myself to sleep because I have no one to talk to about all of this and seemingly no options besides lose her and wait until shes ready to either leave or get back together... 


TL'DR: I said something that caused My gf to say she needs a break and go from super affectionate and ""needy"" to not even caring about talking to me. I'm not sure what to do. And it's hard because everytime I've gotten the courage to break it off shes said she still loves me and wants to be with me but wants to figure out her life.

Sorry if this is incoherent, I'm just very distraught and cant even think clearly at the moment.",relationship_advice
t3_chlet4,"I (19F) have been dating my boyfriend (21M) for almost a year, but I think I'm falling for someone else.","I met my boyfriend at the beginning of my freshman year of college, and we've been dating basically since school started. Things have been great, but sometimes I have doubts and worries about the relationship. From pretty early on, I've noticed that I've felt a lot of pressure from him, our friends, our families, and myself too, really, that this relationship was the end all be all for me. This has thoroughly terrified me, especially recently, leaving me feeling pretty trapped, but I've been just riding it out hoping it would go away. 
Then, this summer happened. I made a new friend, and we started hanging out more. I quickly realized he thought it was more than friendly, but my intentions were never as such. After hanging out more, however, I've noticed I'm starting to feel a little differently about the situation for a multitude of reasons. For example, I've been noticing lately that, as I've been struggling with some newly discovered mental health issues, my boyfriend's not the most understanding or comforting when the time comes. He usually just brushes it off with a sarcastic comment meant to laugh it off. The other friend sent me this crazy thoughtful message the other day when I talked out a problem with him. It was honestly the nicest thing anybody's said to me in a really long time.
I've consulted with lots of my friends, and I know I should wait it out until the school year starts again to really address what I want to do with my boyfriend (who now also lives a few hours away), but I'm not sure what to do. We're in the same major, we have lots of the same friends, it would be so hard to end it if that's what it comes to.

t3_chd1al,"I [17M] am already uncomfortable with the amount of animals living at my dad’s house, and feel like my concerns aren’t heard, but my uncle, [40sM] has “gifted” us an adult pitbull.","Recently my cousins [3F, 4F, 7F, 13F] have been staying with us, their mom is not in the picture and their dad is incapable of caring for them. He (my uncle/stepmoms brother) often appears randomly bearing gifts and such for his kids, anything from a jungle gym to a fake shrunken head to a goddamn skeleton like you see in the doctors office. Well, today he appeared once again bringing with him a fully grown pitbull, not a puppy, but an adult pitbull. This might have been fine if we had only a dog or a cat, but we have 4 dogs, 7 fish, a parrot, and 2 cats, plus about 10 neighborhood cats that we end up feeding. I cannot handle another animal, they pee, poop, and are constantly chasing each other in the middle of the night, I often can’t sleep. I’ve brought this up with my dad who has said that I “need to just deal with it”. I have a theory that my stepmom uses animals to deal with her untreated ptsd and anxiety (that’s a whole different story).  I talked with my uncle when he appeared with the pitbull and told him that I don’t think we need another animal and that it wasn’t cool for him to drop such a commitment on us (especially after dropping all of his children on us unexpectedly). He told me to stop being a whiny little bitch and shut the fuck up. I feel like I can’t deal with anymore animals honestly and feel like my input on the animals is completely ignored. The last time we got a dog I was at rehearsals for my school’s play and got a call from my dad asking if I thought we should get another dog, I said no and listed my concerns with it, he said ok, my brother was also asked and he said that he never wanted another dog. Well I came home and we had gotten the dog anyways. This exact scenario has happened every time a new animal appears. Now is there any way I can address these issues and be heard or be silenced?

t3_chhavf,My [19F] dad [47M] does not listen to me or my mom [40M] and this has become a huge problem in our lives. We don't know what to do anymore.,"I'm not gonna go into detail otherwise I'll be rambling about all the stupid crazy stuff my dad gets mad about. This is more like a rant. But all my life my dad has never once admitted he was wrong, not to me, not to my mother. It doesn't matter the argument, even if it is obvious he's in the wrong he'll find a way to turn it around and blame us.

My mom used to tell me to just listen and stay quiet when he threw fits at us. He's never been physically violent but he yells and screams a lot. I got tired of this when I was 14 and started fighting back, which lead to us arguing even more and that's when my relationship with my father first deteriorated.

Last year I started university in another country which helped me get away from all this madness at home. I came back this year for summer break and in the first week my mom talked to me about how she wanted a divorce. It's not the first time she mentioned about divorcing him, but it was the first time she actually sat me down and talked. She told me how they would fight almost every week and he would get insanely mad over little things like a dish not washed. I support her in the decision, of course, as I came to terms that they did not love each other anymore since I was a child. But my mom never went to college. She never worked. The few times she tried to my dad would argue with her and make her drop out of college or leave work because she needed to ""take care of me"". She couldn't do much about it, he had all the money after all.

Now, onto the issue that made me want to write this post. We are going to travel in a few weeks to visit his father, who lives in another country. My grandpa always plans our trips, every second of them. My mom and I gave our opinions about this in the past but it would always cause the worst of our fights, so we let it go. Now it's different. I have a boyfriend who is from the same country as my grandpa, and we were planning on meeting up there. I asked my dad if he could tag along on our trip to the countryside (we usually stay in the capital but this time my grandpa wanted to spend anfew days in a different city) and my father agreed. This would be the first time my parents and my boyfriend meet. He said the trip would last 5 days. My grandpa scheduled it for two weeks. Out of our 21 days trip. 14 days in the countryside.

Naturally, my mother and I complained. And my dad lost his shit. He started yelling and calling me and my boyfriend names, saying that I was the most disrespectful bitch and told me to go to hell. Not once did I mention my boyfriend. Me and my mom wanted the trip shortened and we went to talk to him about it. My dad did not care, and kept calling us names and told us that we shouldn't even go to the trip at all.

We can't live like this anymore. But we don't know what to do. My mom doesn't work, all her money comes from him, I'm studying abroad and I have no money on my name either. But we can't live like this anymore. We're so tired. We don't know what to do. We told him to go to therapy and sort out his anger issues in the past, in the nicest way we could and he still got insanely angry. We try to reason with him but he always turns it around. Words don't seem to get through his head. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: My dad is an unreasonable POS that thinks he's always right and my mother and I hate him. We have no money since he is the only one that works and he cannot be reasoned with. We don't know what to do.",relationship_advice

t3_chlbu6,"I [26M] invited a girl [24F] out for coffee, but postponed, because I got rushed to the hospital. Now I am out of the hospital, but she’s leaving for a holiday. How not to be annoying?","TLDR at the bottom.

Hi sunshines.

A bit of background - my ex-girlfriend dumped me, two days later I bought a car and got hit another 2 days after that, and the day after the crash I got laid off.

Now, imagine the pressure I’m under.

I actually decided not to be saddened by all of this, but I wanted to try and remain positive. I knew I would need a bit of help from friends, cause I am an over-thinker and because of this I... overthink (duh). And this last part... is not helpful.

So, the main part of the problem - One Friday I was going out for dinner with an old friend of mine, so that I can vent and stuff, and there I got introduced to a really cute girl. She took my friends’ and my Facebook, cause we are all into board games, and I didn’t think anything of it.

But on Monday I decided to message her. She told me previously she liked cats, so I did the most “original thing” - sent her a picture of a friends cat and said “you’re gonna love him”. From there we didn’t stop talking the whole day and around the end of the day I just said “well, this must continue over coffee”.

On Tuesday morning, my lung collapsed. Oh, the fun. Oh, the pain. Oh, the words of my doctor “Hospital, now, you don’t have time to go back home and pack for it.” I got rushed there by taxi, cause the ambulance would be slower (the irony in this sentence). And I stayed there for 9 days, undergoing surgery and stuff.

In the meantime, I told this girl we would have to postpone the coffee, cause I’m in a different mood (mood, ha). I tried joking a bit, cause the hospital is no fun. She wanted to come visit me, but I just declined, because I wasn’t well and didn’t want her to have the impression of me as a victim. In the same time I was in pain for days, so I wasn’t up for verbal conversations - even one word per breath was difficult.

We chatted the whole week and today I left the hospital. I’m still really tired though, so we decided not to meet today.

Tomorrow she’s leaving for a 10 day holiday with friends to the sea and actually invited me several times. I was thinking of coming the second weekend, but after consulting with the doctor, he told me it’s better not to - an open wound, sand, high temperatures, and salty water - those things don’t go well together. (Strange, isn’t it?)

I want to message her, cause our conversations are always long and sometimes really flirty, but I know I overdo things a bit. I also don’t want to be That Annoying Guy.

After that we’ll meet up, and she said something about stealing my pyjamas while I’m wearing them. I told her that in this case I’d steal the clothes, that she’s currently wearing, cause it’s “eye for an eye, pyjamas for...” and she just said “Agreed”.

Can you help me in how to interact with her the following 10 days without being annoying?

TLDR - How not to be annoying to a girl in the next 10 days, while she’s on holiday? We agreed to have a date after that.",relationship_advice
t3_chi9az,My [25F] friend [25f] has revealed to me that her boyfriend’s [27M] long term mental abuse has turned into physical abuse and I don’t know what to do.,"My friend has recently revealed to me through text and pictures that her boyfriend has begun to physically abuse her. She said that he “just tried to push her out of the way” but the bruises all over her arms say otherwise. Upon prompting her a little, she finally told me that it wasn’t an accident and it wasn’t the first time. They were recently on vacation and he wouldn’t let her leave the hotel in 30+ degree weather unless she was wearing a sweater (to hide the bruises)

I’ve suspected for a while that he was becoming physically abusive but she always denied it, or had an “excuse”. Like the time she fell down the stairs when she was 6 months pregnant and had to be rushed to the hospital was just an “accident” and he didn’t mean to push her.

For about 2 years now (about 5 months after they started dating) he has been manipulative, controlling and cruel. 

I begged her to leave him before something happened like her getting pregnant (which ended up happening), or before he became violent (which also ended up happening). But she would always stay. I once successfully convinced her to take all of her things out of the house and leave while he was at work (so he couldn’t hurt her) and as we were frantically packing his stuff he was calling her telling her if she wasn’t gone when he got home from work (he left early) he was going to “choke her out and make her regret it”

I was so happy to have her finally leave, to be told she had gone back with him to live in his house 2 days later. Soon after, she became pregnant and once again I begged her to leave, but this just caused her to distance herself from me and in turn become closer to him (I’m one of her only close friends she goes out with)

After the baby was born (3 months ago) we became very close again. I noticed all of her stories of verbal abusive had come to an end, but she just wasn’t telling me in fear of me trying to push her to leave or in fear that I would tell someone.

I know she has told some family members of the verbal abuse, but they won’t do anything. From what I can see all of her sisters are also in verbal or physical abusive relationships, so it must be common for her to experience these things or hear of others experiencing these things.

I guess she finally cracked, and she told me of the actual physical abuse that has begun. They are back from vacation now and she is avoiding me. She swore me to secrecy and I don’t know what to do. I feel responsible for the safety of her and her child and I’m afraid if I don’t do something he will hurt her more badly, or maybe even the baby. I’m afraid I do something and she doesn’t want me to it will end up going no where and she will push me away and become more strongly attached to him which is what happened before.

I have told her time and time again that at any point in time I have a place for them to stay, I will come pick them up or help her sneak her things out of the house again. Anything at all I can do to help. But she continues to stay. 

I need advice. What do I do? 

TL;DR my friend is being physically and emotionally abused by her boyfriend whom she has a 3 month old baby with. She doesn’t want help, but I feel like I need to do something I just don’t know what to do.",relationship_advice

t3_chgfxe,My pride is ruining anything fun in my relationship,"My boyfriend [29M] and I [27F] have been dating for 3.5 years. 

I have pre-existing depression and anxiety and as I’ve gotten older, they’ve both gotten worse. I think I’ve had them my entire life but when I was younger I had a defined role in society as a student and was great at it. I also had a pretty strong extra curricular life, especially with soccer. Those were things I knew and was good at and was better than most people. It made me feel confident even when I had pretty shaky self esteem otherwise. Once I graduated college and had to become an adult, I no longer excelled at anything anymore and was totally mediocre. That sounds really dumb typing it out but depression has hit me hard. 

I only bring that up because I’m pretty sure that’s the root of why this current issue with my boyfriend is even an issue. 

He’s better than me at everything. He’s a better cook, he’s better at sports, he has a better job, he makes more money, he doesn’t have crippling anxiety when he’s in social situations, he’s smarter, he has drive and motivation. 

As awful as it is to say, it makes me hate doing anything with him. Even if he doesn’t make something a competition, it still feels like one. Even if it’s a brand new thing that neither of us have ever ever done, he still somehow manages to be better. Every. Time. He wins every game we play and always knows a better to way to do something than I do. 

This is 100% a me problem. I have zero self esteem and I take everything way too personally. I never want to ask him for help on things because I interpret any of his advice or criticism as condescending or him feeling sorry for me so I usually end up having some kind of meltdown over it instead. I completely shut down any options to grow as a person because I constantly play the victim and throw myself a pity party because I’m not as good as him at anything. Instead of trying to better myself I just quit altogether. 

This sounds so juvenile, but I think it’s going to ruin my relationship. What can I work on individually to stop acting the way I do? I get embarrassed showing effort and I’m terrified of him seeing me fail at trying. For once, I’d like him to ask me for help on something and I’d actually feel useful.",relationship_advice
t3_chla5g,My (21F) boyfriend (22M) hates my nickname and only calls me by my full name. Is that weird?,"So for reference, my nickname is Gigi. My full name is Angelina, pretty long for a kid to learn to pronounce and write so I have been going by Gigi since I was little. No one really calls me Angelina. Some people say the two sound so different and it doesn’t make sense but oh well. 

I met my boyfriend in college and he saw me signing next to Angelina so he was basically like oh hey I’m Tyler, you’re Angelina right? I thought that was so weird since no one calls me that so he couldn’t have overheard my friends or something. Lol then I realized he was creeping on me when I was signing the attendance sheet lol. We started talking so I told him he can call me Gigi and he was just immediately so turned off. He said that was such a baby name like it wasn’t a real name, it was just baby talk.

I was like ok whatever but he keeps calling me Angelina. It’s weird. It annoys me. Only professors and people at the DMV call me that. All my friends and family call me Gigi. He pretty much refuses to call me it which is so weird since it’s my name. He just thinks it’s so babyish and weird. I told him to not call me Angelina anymore and he started calling me you or girl. Like “hey you” or “what’s up girl”. Like what the fuck? He refuses to call me Gigi. I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. It’s just a name. I feel weird when he calls me my full name, that’s what strangers call me. We’re close enough now where he should follow what my friends and family address me by.

The reason it ended, despite us both having strong feelings for each other is because I was overcoming a sexual assault trauma and was beating myself up about not being able to move forward in the relationship (he had tried to kiss me-- I freaked out, things got awkward and I wasn't ready to explain). 

Anyway, fast forward a couple years to now. That same past boyfriend (now M21) and I have somewhat kept in touch, we have many mutual friends and didn't end on bad terms so we started talking on and off about a year (or maybe less) after the breakup. He is the type of guy that is always in a relationship so after we broke up, he immediately started dating again. For the past two years he has been in a relationship with another girl and they were engaged + moved in together about 4 hours away from me where she is going to college somewhat recently. 

When we first started talking again, it was mainly about our mutual friends but occasionally he would come off quite obviously flirty but I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so I never called him out. Recently, he has expressed to me that he is quite depressed and unhappy in his relationship. He came down to visit (without girlfriend) and I hung out with him in a group with our friends. There were times where he would text me separately when we were with everyone else and make jokes. It seemed like he was constantly looking for my attention and looking at me while we hung out. 

As for me, I have never stopped having feelings for him-- we only broke up because of that trauma and since then I have grown and changed. However, when he got into a relationship again, I of course cut off all hope of us trying again and decided to just be his friend. 

Anyway, at the end of the night after we all hung out he dropped everyone off one by one and I was the last to go. He said some things I considered quite inappropriate like that his girlfriend asks him frequently who is prettier between the two of us and he told me that he ""out of obligation"" said she was. Very strange. Afterwards, we had a fight over text that I won't get into (it's unrelated but lead to a conversation about me not saying how I really feel) and I confessed that I still have feelings for him. He responded and said he felt the same way and wants to leave his gf and come back. It was a very emotional conversation and he basically said he never stopped having feelings for me either, and feels like he settled. Later, he told me that they ""basically broke up"" and he is sleeping on the couch and will be moving back in March when his lease ends (I think?). 

I really don't know how to feel. I feel that the way he acted towards me while he was ENGAGED was not appropriate and I find his supposed break-up somewhat suspicious. If he does move back down we would both need time (I especially think he needs time by himself) but if we ever got together again I'm not sure I could trust him. If he acted like that while engaged how would he act in a relationship?

Sorry this ended up being so long! 

P.S. he also just texted me and said he is coming back down again this weekend and wants to see me. I don't feel right about seeing him one on one while he is still living with her but I don't know what he is expecting. What do I do?",relationship_advice
t3_chjfsl,"Trapped in my living situation, please give me advice.","I’m a 21 year old female and I’m currently in nursing school. I have about 2 years before I finish and am able to get a job assuming I pass my nclex. I currently live with my father. When my parents got a divorce about a decade ago, he fell into a deep depression and has let our house completely fall apart. There are rat holes in the walls everywhere, fleas from him not taking car of his pets, a broken stove/oven, no dishwasher, and halfway ripped up carpet. We only have a gas furnace for heat and one air conditioner for air and my room being in the back of the house, stays freezing and unbearably hot according to the season. I know people have it worse but I can’t stand being here. It’s impossible to do any studying or homework with the sheer temperature of my own room. There’s also no living room furniture except for a chair the dogs have torn apart. I love my dad and I’m grateful for a place to live but I am at my breaking point with him refusing to pick up his life. (This is not a money issue with him.) My mom recently offered to pay for a one bedroom apartment. I cannot fully pay for this or even come close with my school schedule and the hours I can work. Where I live it would add up to about 850 for the cheapest place we could find. My mother is only a teacher and I’m concerned with how she will actually pay for this or wether she really will. When I was 16, she kicked me out of her house because she wanted her new boyfriend to live with her and he didn’t want me around. It’s been about 5 years and I have only seen her face to face 3 times since then. I obviously am astonished and grateful by the offer to pay for an apartment, but I don’t know if I trust her to pay that amount for 2 years (it would add up to about 20 grand.) I don’t want to get myself stuck in a bad situation. I also have a boyfriend who I’ve been dating for two years who is also 21. He currently has a really great job and now would be a perfect time for us to move out together. He however isn’t wanting to at the moment even though if we split the rent, I could afford it without my mothers help. He keeps saying he wants to move out when he turns 22, which is in 7 months. He hasn’t made any real plans with me or started saving though and I ask him if I should wait for him all the time and he says no..... even though a 7 month wait to save thousands of dollars is something I would do in a heartbeat. I’m feeling really trapped and unsure of what to do. Do I touch it out with my father (which will undoubtedly diminish our relationship and put me deeper into depression that I’m already in living there), trust my mom who has screwed me over many times before, or try to wait on my boyfriend who shows no real signs of wanting to actually move out (this could also ruin our relationship, putting pressure on him.)


Edit: I am not mad at my father. I love him very much and I beg him to care for himself and our living situation, but I’ve done all I can and I can’t keep living in a world with constant reminders from him that the divorce ruined everything. I also want to say that I’m not mad at my boyfriend, although I do feel hurt, I don’t blame him for wanting to stay at his clean loving home. I just overall feel trapped and hopeless and wish everything was different. Also I have tried for months to find a roommate, but have had no luck. All I want is a clean place to live.",relationship_advice
t3_chi47q,What is cheating?,"So, I’ve been in a long distance relationship for a while now and the person I’m dating seems to have a different idea of what cheating actually is since she says she’s never cheated on me. Now I’d normally just not even bother asking anyone about this and just assume I’m wrong but this is different and I’m not who I used to be. According to her, kissing, touching, and basically everything except for sex IS NOT cheating. The only thing she sees as cheating is sex. The reason why I’m asking is because she has had physical relations with two other guys but they haven’t had sex according to her, and since they haven’t had sex she hasn’t cheated. I guess what I’m wondering is if my idea of cheating is wrong? Any advice or help would be appreciated. Thanks",relationship_advice

t3_ch9uka,My brother in law compares his long distance girlfriend to me and I feel bad for her.,"Context: BIL moved from his home state a couple of years ago and wasn't happy so my boyfriend told him he could come stay with us in a state about 2 hours from their home state. BIL has an on again/off again relationship with a younger woman. My boyfriend and I are going through a little bit of a rough patch and he's staying with a friend and his brother is still living with me until he finds a place to go. 

Now for the issue, I commented a little bit ago praising my dad for teaching me how to work on cars and do home repairs/maintenance. My whole childhood he told me ""you're never gonna NEED a man"" and I don't, but that comment sparked this post. My BIL didn't like me until he came to live with us. He realised his brother is going through some shit, I call it his midlife crisis coupled with some mental issues, and ended up on my side a lot. We actually became friends. The girlfriend type thing and him argue a lot, pretty much every time they talk and I've heard him say things like ""you can't change oil on a car. You don't know anything about plumbing or electric. You've never cut the grass. You can't cook more than tuna fish. You barely know how to run a vacuum cleaner"". The time I realised what was happening was after I changed out a part on the car (faulty fuel rail sensor) and a day or 2 later he asked her if she even knew what a fuel rail sensor was. He got off the phone with her and I told him it wasn't fair to compare her to me like that. He tried to tell me he wasn't and I said maybe compare isn't the best word but this isn't the first time I've heard him bitch at her for not being able to do something that I can and it's not cool because I got lucky and had a dad that taught me everything from gun safety to reading blue prints. He still makes comments to her about things that I feel bad for. 

Personally I think that relationship is over but obviously it's not my place. I don't think he has feelings for me or anything but I do think he's a little jealous of his brother. I'm just asking how to make him stop without me having to stop fixing shit, lol. Every time I hear him say something I'll tell him to stop when he gets off the phone and now his response is usually something along the lines of ""what? She's so spoiled and she needs someone to do everything for her"". The thing is that she's a really really hard worker. She has 2 jobs, she's good with money and she can pay people to do things for her. Plus with working 2 jobs she doesn't really have time to even learn how to do those things. She has her shit together, at her age we were all junkies (boyfriend, BIL and me). I know it's not a good idea to message her and tell her not to take those things personally and idk why he's doing that and I feel bad. I know that she would get the wrong idea and it would make things worse. 

Sorry if this turned into a rant. I'm just at a loss because I feel so bad that she's defending herself for shit that she shouldn't have to and she doesn't even know why.",relationship_advice

t3_chl6wq,One of my ex girlfriend is trying to leech off another one of my ex girlfriend..,"I [m/25] dated two different girls at different periods of time. The first was a friend prior to the relationship, and I broke it off after a few months as I discovered she had various issues ranging from cheating to heavy drug abuse and even more. The second girl was introduced to me by a friend and we hit it off like fireworks on the 4th of july and during the initial few months things were out of this world! However, I soon discovered she too, had various issues ranging from mental to cheating so I broke it off with her as well as I didn't wanna be associated with such a trash person.  After dumping both, I refused any contact with them and requested them to move on although as months passed they would continue to try and get me back which was honestly sad to witness and on the advice of the girl I am currently seeing, I decided ignoring her would be the best way to get her away for good. 

Lately I was made aware that both these women have recently gotten to know each other and I suspect I might be the common denominator for this. What worries me is girl1 is absolutely toxic; she; wait for it, believes her damn astrological sign (scorpion) is her excuse to behave like an abusive psychotic maniac and ever since they've met, girl2's work performance has dropped to never seen before lows. She was loved all over the workplace and her hard work was always admired and was destined for even greater heights but ever since girl1 entered her life it's like girl2 has turned into a shell of her former person. Even her face has begun showing signs of stress which breaks my heart; I presume due to the fake stories girl1 spreads to her about me as girl1 always wanted to see me fail as she was always jealous of me. When me and girl2 were together, I did warn her about girl1 and how she is the biggest leech without an ounce of morality and honour who can go to any level to bring others down as she never had the talent and determination to reach their level in the first place; but it seems she didn't pay much heed to my advice.. and is now withering. Girl1 is also very conniving and sly in her ways of leeching and makes it really hard for someone to realize her true intentions and it is really sad to see girl2 like this; as no matter how trashy she was she still had a good heart. How in gods green earth should I tell girl2 to straighten the hell up and screw her head on back in place? toodles..",relationship_advice
t3_chjbiu,Am I [F19] only good for sex?,"So, honestly, I feel like the only thing people ever want from me is sex. I have a FWB, but that’s a whole different thing honestly that I’m okay with. But other than that, I feel like people only want me for my body and nothing else. Every single guy I come across that’s potential for something real, it’s all about sex. 

Like, my first boyfriend I ever had, he always used me for sex. My ex-fiancé, talked about sex 24/7 and it made me feel so mentally exhausted. But whenever I come across a guy that seems genuine, he ends up just using me for sex and then never speaks to me again. I tried the thing where I tell guys that I don’t want to have sex right away, and immediately they lose interest in me and the conversation. 

It feels like no matter what I do, if I don’t put out, then no one would ever give me the time of day. But once I do, they use and discard me. What do I change about myself to make myself more desirable? How do I just make myself that girl who’s not just “easy”? Because honestly, just thinking about it breaks my heart. I don’t like knowing that I’m the easy girl. I want someone to see the real me.

She has a guy friend that has repeatedly asked her to marry him over the course of time. She has told me not to worry and that she doesn’t want to, he’s ugly because of his Treacher Collins, etc. But just a few weeks ago she was depressed and super stressed out and wouldn’t talk to me, which led to my being blocked because I kept trying to figure out what was wrong. Today I find out they are “engaged”, but she says she won’t marry him. They have been “engaged” since before we even met. Hmmmm come again?! I hope this is a joke.

Things were pretty hostile when she had blocked me, but talking was peaceful today. I don’t know if she’s still coming to visit, her plane leaves tomorrow. She always tells me she isn’t coming home, or is very cryptic, because she doesn’t like to feel pressured.

I love this girl, this past month has been an emotional rollercoaster and disaster for me. She says she loves me too but simply don’t know what to do, do I pursue this girl and hope to win her over? Do I cut and run? Do I just remain FWBs?

This is not taking into account that we both have mental issues and things can be pretty tumultuous between us, but we do understand each other because of that.

I've been in a relationship with this one girl for a while now (About year and a half) and some time ago we started having some issues. Basically, she started acting more distant. At first I thought it was me, but then I learned that she was having some family and college related problems that she had chosen, at first, not to tell me about.

I told her I was there for her should she need someone to talk to, but she told me she didn't want to burden me and I didn't insist. Shortly after that, she told me she didn't feel the same way she used to towards me and said she needed time to think. I agreed, and we ceased contact for about a month.

When we started talking again, things went great. We went out, had fun and the chemistry was still there luckily. But, it only lasted a couple days before she started acting distant again. For the next two months, everytime I asked her out she had a different reason why she couldn't meet me. I asked her if everything was ok and she again told me she was having a really hard time dealing with everything going on in her life, but that she really wanted me to be a part of it and reassured me she was not making excuses.

Eventually, we managed to set up a date, but about two hours before meeting she called me and told me she wasn't gonna make it. After waiting for so long to see her again, I was starting to feel she was stringing me along and I told her. Needless to say, she got angry and later apologized, as did I for accusing her. We ended up seeing each other for about half an hour that day, during which she actually offered to meet again a fews days later. The next day I texted her and got no response. I waited a couple days more and yet again got no response. I got worried something was wrong and so texted her again. She replied, and basically told me she felt as if I was suffocating her, that she needed space and so I backed away.

About four days later, she texted me apologizing and telling me she wanted to meet up to talk and fix things, she offered last Friday and I agreed. Friday came along and about two hours before meeting, she postponed. I agreed and then she proceeded to postpone two more times after which I asked her what she wanted to talk about, but she wasn't very specific and simply said 'about us'. I told her I had a feeling she wanted to break up with me and she didn't answer, simply said 'I need time to think. I'm going on vacation with my family on tuesday and I'll have a possibility to think clearly'.

On tuesday morning she texted me and told me she would be gone for about two weeks and that she would contact me once she was ready. I guess my question is simply how do I deal with this situation? Should I just assume it's over and she's just posponing the break-up for later? Is there any hope things can be fixed, and if so is it even worth it at this point?",relationship_advice
t3_chj5k8,I don’t feel like my boyfriend loves me anymore but anytime I go to leave he gets mad and asks me to stay because “he can’t lose me”,"Basically what it says, the past month has been horrible relationship wise. I found a Snapchat he had been hiding for porn, or so he says. Ok I finally got over it and let it slide. Fuck it, whatever, but he refuses to spend time with me or pay attention to me, or even have sex, and if we do he doesn’t finish. I should also add I’ve been with this man 2 years and live with him. He constantly wants to play a video game or is on his phone playing some bullshit. I’m about to start school here soon for Pharmacy and attempting a doctorate in three years (accelerated program). I don’t know how much I can take and feel lonely and lost and don’t have anyone to talk to or friends because I pushed everyone away to be with him, and to make him happy. Even when I have an aunt come over sometimes and she tries to talk to him he’s devoured in a video game or YouTube and will completely ignore anybody around him, and she even said it has to be embarrassing on my part, which it is. Idk why either, I have changed or gained weight, I like to think I’m not ugly. I just feel like I should feel loved and wanted and I don’t think I’m getting that, but whenever I bring it up I’m being dramatic, or he’s sick and tired, which is an excuse I get all the time. Am I overreacting? Is he in the wrong? Do I leave? I would love to make it work with him but sometimes I feel like he don’t care.",relationship_advice
t3_chg236,Tomorrow is my Birthday. 5 years in my relationship. Could you leave your partner on your birthday?,"Been together 5 years last week.  Engaged for the past 4.  Have had horrible fights lately and he recently moved the wedding date 9 months from now.

Fights are pretty much daily.  We are both crazy i'm sure... but of course, I see the fact that he's just so mean to me.  Last night was one of the worst.  He said I've ruined his life,  that I ""harass him"" by texting him during the day, control him (by asking him to work in bed at 1am instead of on the couch), act like it's the ""military"" because I asked him what I could get him at the grocery store at 4pm before his workout and he said that he wanted to go out to eat (EVERY FUC\*ING NIGHT) because he won't know what he will be hungry for in 2 hours.  Said that I'm ""insane"".  That i'm selfish.  That he doesn't believe I have any concern for him -- that life with me is a disaster and that I'm crazy.  

&amp;#x200B;

He asked what promises I could make to change -- or else he sees no reason that I would want to be with him and he might as well leave.  He threatens to leave me during 90 percent of our fights because he says I don't seem loyal or excited enough about being wth him.  And that I'm not appreciative enough.

&amp;#x200B;

He spent a lot of money to take me on a bday trip.  And after this horrible fight last night he kept asking to buy me things today....in advance of my bday.  I met with a family member today who told me I need to get out of this toxic hell.   And I feel paralyzed and scared of being single.  Tomorrow I'll be 44 .... 

Should I just leave him on my own darn bday?  Or make it through...and deal with it later this week.  I like to delay and dismiss and put my head in the sand....",relationship_advice

I've been dating my boyfriend for a year and 2 months. We get along incredibly well, same interests, same goals in life, etc. So much in fact that we are moving in together! Should be amazing, right?


Not so simple. I'm excited to move in. I love this guy with all my heart. But I'm struggling a lot emotionally.


Things I'm struggling with:

1. I have a slightly higher sex drive. I love him enough to try to work around it but it really effects me. I get very depressed and feel unloved. Despite him constantly trying to remind me.


2.  We talk every night over discord playing some game like battle block theater. I crave this time with him but sometimes I just feel numb when we play, like I don't get any enjoyment out of it



3. When I'm at work, we send each other texts once an hour, and sometimes text whole conversations for like an hour



4. I'd rather hang out with him than other friends, and I don't make an effort to make new friends since I have him



5. I know this one seems a bit obsessive, but I made some sim characters that I like to play and it makes me feel better. I think I'm depressed (suicidal in the past) and this makes me feel better about my future.



6. It feels like he's my only escape. I live in a low income family, my mom's a hoarder, and my house in disrepair. I get to see him on Saturdays. And I usually get upset and don't want to leave his car when he wants to drop me off because of what I have to go back into. (he lives with his dad and stepmom in a super nice upper-class home)
 


School starts up for me in August, about 3 weeks. We don't have a place solidified, and I really don't want to make a 3 hour total commute everyday.  So finding a place has been a strain on our relationship as well. 


We are awesome at communicating . Probably why we minimize disagreements compared to my other relationships. But we haven't been able to talk this out. 


I think I have depression, anxiety, and my boyfriend says he thinks I have ADHD too. I'm going to start seeing a therapist in the fall when I have free therapy from my school. I just need some peoples opinions.",relationship_advice

Tl;dr girlfriend chose alcohol over a trusting and loving relationship.

Edit: so why it ended the first time was because she invited me to meet him and they were flirting the whole time (she told me he was her ex) I asked her wtf was that about and she said for me to leave. They got fucked up and she admitted that he convinced her that ""I loved her too much"". I asked her when she was going to tell me if that night never happened and she said she wouldn't have even though about breaking up with me for more than a couple weeks.

t3_chht0a,Help with relationship dealbreakers or ultimatums?,"I (22F) have gotten to the point in my relationships that I refuse to tolerate crap and toxic people. I understand that people are nuanced and nobody is perfect and some days will be better or worse than others. I am trying to figure out how to discuss my dealbreakers without it seeming like ""emotional blackmail"". 

Some people say you have to communicate with your partner or friend that their behavior is a dealbreaker and will not be tolerated. On the other hand people regard that as emotional manipulation because it's ""threatening the relationship"". But I believe people cling too hard to their toxic behaviors and claim that's *who they are* and that you're trying to *change them*. I never believed asking someone to be more considerate or communicative is ""trying to change them"" but 🤷.

Anyway, you could tell people these things and they ""change"" but then resent you? Like, someone help me with this because I feel a bit lost as for what to do.",relationship_advice

L and A were dating lot of time ago, L got depression and low self-esteem time before breaking with A and he used it to his favor, made A to give him things in her birthday, A was in a psychiatric hospital, L convinced everyone to get him out, and we'll A got out of her life. Time later, I started dating L but she was so traumatized that she always inserted A on conversations, and made me mad about it and wanting to punch A on the face. A year or so ago, G entered our lives as a friend, made a pair of gift drawings to L, L saw her as a friend, and I didn't talk to her too much.
Time ago, G ""revived"" and old OC which was in its first new drawing really lookalike L's OC, then when L checked G's friend list, there was A with a secondary account, this made her paranoid about it, making her think G wanted to steal her OC, G talked to L wanting to convince her that she wasn't trying to steal the OC, but this paranoia about A blinded L making her to talk a lot about that theme, I insisted G wasn't trying to steal anything, and to forget that theme because of that, making L to acuse me about defending G.
Well, a pair of days ago in the middle of one of those conversations, L insisted a lot but I mean a LOT to making me talk to her to convince G to use another OC she made and was using before this OC of the controversy, and telling me to say ""where so you want to go with this"" phrase that started all the problems.
G And L started to send a lot of messages calls and voice messages, but L was in that moment really depressed and crying about the theme so all that messages were felt as threatening and G finally blocked L not before telling all this theme to A, who was blocked by that time, and then A well, messaged L asking her what was happening, because L and A talked via Telegram sometimes, A said a lot of hurtful things about L and then started to insult me, just because G told A that I was dating L, thing that L hid from A to avoid him trying to damage me, then G blocked after sending me only a like emoji.
I would like to ask before all, should we ask G's boyfriend to help us to get everyone out of this? She told in a group where she was talking about this theme ""I fear to tell this to my boyfriend, because I think he would take this in a bad way""I mean, G went to L's Ex to tell everything as an inmature way to defend herself.
Or what we can do about this, forget everything and say bye to G or take time and try to be more civilized and do a more coherent thing?

But I don’t want to dump all of this on him at once, that doesn’t seem fair.

I’m not suited to nagging about stuff every six weeks, so I swallow it. And take care of myself, and him, and the house.

We are both 27.

She looks like an adult (she looks older than I do).

I feel really upset because I was sexually abused by an older man (late 20s) at around 15-17 and he knows this. I feel like it's disrespectful to how I feel and the shit that still traumatizes me and the shit I will carry with me to my grave.

I've had discussions about this with him before (this isn't the first time or first dubiously aged instagram ""model""). He knew how I felt about this and did it anyway. At least he had the balls to admit it and be honest, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

We have been together 4 years and moved in together (my place, he would have to leave). Our sex life is basically lacking hardcore (mostly because he is unenthusiastic and like a dead fish, for reasons I can only begin to imagine).

t3_chkvla,"Me (17F) and my friend (17M) complicated relationship, I don't know how should I do about this","We are in the same school but he just graduated this year while I'm an upcoming senior. I first talked to him solely for advice for school stuff. After that, we started to chat and become closer. He started to bring personal things to the chat and told me his secrets here and there. He is funny to me and sometimes quite kind and thoughtful also. However, I know he has a girlfriend (14F) so I try to make things straightforward. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just in the start of summer, me, him and a mutual friend (17F) of us in my class went out for a movie with him. Everything was fine, so just last week we went for another movie again. However, this time my friend was suddenly busy and couldn't go, so it was just me and him. Now, things started to get weird. Because we went to a not-so-famous movie so there were very few people in the screen room. At first, we just watched normally. About half of the movie, he started to lean over to me and touched my body, his elbow touched/pressed on my chest. I wasn't quite sure if it was only an accident or he really meant to do that. Later, he turned his body over to me and his hand grabbed my boobs. I felt weird so I pushed him out, but I didn't tell him to stop by words (Idk why maybe because normally I am a quite shy and insecure person, and there were also people in the cinema). I also tried to tightly hold his hands to stop him touch my body but he kept coming for more. I used to jacket to cover my body and pushed him out. Finally, he stopped and we just watched til the end of the movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day, he apologized me and regretted doing that. But, he also revealed that he didn't touch or did sth like that to his girlfriend before as he thought she is too young. He told me he gets turned on around girls and wants to touch their bodies and stuffs like that if there is no one else, he said other men are the same. I thought this explanation is b.s but can't say anything about it. I told him his behavior was too extreme and if he couldn't control himself, he should meet a doctor or a psychologist, but he also said he already went and they said it is normal nature of men(?)

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I tried to bring that up again but he didn't take it seriously. When I asked him whether he will be embarrassed or weird out if he meets me again, he said no. I said I do, and he tried to convince me time will make me forget it eventually. Still, he still trying to initiate a conversation and chat like normal but I then cut it off.

 

I don't really know what did he want from me. Does he even spend his time talking to me for this or this was really an accident as he said? I stop talking to him a week already but didn't do anything to our relationship yet. How should I resolve this issue because I dont want to hang it there like nothing? Should I entirely cut off this relationship (he is quite beneficial in terms of experience and information for my senior year, but I feel not right talking to him) or should I maintain this at a certain level? Should I continue to keep this a secret and pretend like nothing happenned?

He is quite popular at our school actually and generally a kind and helping person to everyone.

t3_chiy7p,Wife (28F)thinks aliens are going to abduct her. What do I (24M) say/do?,"This is a serious post. 

Just for a short backstory, my wife has always believed heavily in spirits, ghosts, and things like that. She said she grew up in a haunted house and has seen ghosts, demons, and other things make their presences known to her. Apparently, one time when she was driving down a mountain road, a “chupacaba” or devil dog stood in front of her car an attempted to attack her. She made her way out. 

To make things more complicated, she is a recovering drug addict. Sober for 4 years from everything. But she used to be addicted to meth and heroin. Which could contribute to some of her “abnormal” ideations. 

Anyways, I’m going to get to the MAIN point here. 

She apparently has seen the word “alien” many times the last 2 weeks. She is paralyzed in fear because of it. 

I have known whenever I mention aliens as a joke she has to put her hands over her face. To the point of tears. After this happened I never did it again. But today she saw the word alien on a tv show poster, and freaked out. I work nights and I’m at work now; she had to go to her sisters house and won’t come until I get there because she’s too scared. She genuinely believes she’s going to get (in her own words) “killed by aliens”. 

I tried to console her about all of this and remind her that we’re in no danger, aliens don’t want any part of our lives. (We also have a 2 month old son.)  She didn’t absorb a word that I said and went to her sisters when I left for work. Especially with all of this Area 51 raid bullshit, she is paralyzed with fear. I’m afraid it’s going to effect my child.

t3_chiwok,My(19 M) girlfriend (19 F) broke up with me to get back with an ex.,So everything was fine until one day my girlfriend says she wants to break up because she is confused. Two breakups happened again after that almost back to back and she started saying she had no feelings for me anymore (nevermind that she said after the first breakup how much she cares for the relationship and how meaningful it is to her and wants to keep moving like that). On the final breakup she told me that she had strong feelings for her ex of 2 years because they accidentally saw each other one day and it made a spark. And now I am asking first was I wrong to try until the final moment to put some logic into her thick skull and also what do I do?,relationship_advice
t3_chaenf,Roommate (35M) Confessed Romantic Feelings for me (30F),"So I (30F) was set to move in with a friend (35M). Before we agreed to share a place (just to save a little extra cash), I told him explicitly that I did not want anything to change between us (pretty sure those are the exact words I used) and he said okay. Leading up to moving in I've felt like he's texting/talking way too much, and he's been commenting on how ""withdrawn"" I am (take a hint!), so finally we had a talk about that maybe 2 weeks ago and he was like ""okay so I need to back way the hell off"" and I said ""yes.""

Then a week ago (9 days to move-in) he tells me he has feelings for me, would regret it if he never told me, etc. I told him I wasn't interested, though it was an awkward conversation. He even said there was no risk for me since ""I could always move out"" if things didn't work out. 

I took a few days to process. During that time he started to try to text/ask lots of questions (the reason I told him to back off in the first place). Every single one of my friends who I mentioned this to echoed my first instinct which was to get my own place. So I recently told him I didn't think we should move in together, since I feel really uncomfortable with the whole situation now. He says I wasn't giving good reasons for feeling uncomfortable, that I've been really withdrawn and haven't given a good explanation for that. He appears to blame me for ruining the arrangement and says that everything would have been totally fine if I hadn't overreacted to a non-issue. 

There are details to our lease agreement, breaking it, etc., but suffice to say that I need to find a new place to live since I'll be technically homeless as of moving day, while he's able to stay at the new place (where he already resides) and pay the rent himself (he can afford it, or get a new roommate).

Questions: 1) what on earth did he think would happen, given that I told him to back off not even a week prior to his confession? why did he not think it was a terrible idea to say this right before I move in? 2) is my decision to not move in an overreaction?",relationship_advice
t3_chhjom,How do I (M20) get my mom (56) to divorce her sociopath husband (55)?,"Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to provide a lot of detail so you all know how terrible this guy is.

So my  mom has been married for 12 years to someone who is a complete sociopath (or at the very least, a massive dick). He's basically ruined her life; she gets drunk a lot more than she used to, she can't go on a vacation without him stressing her out, and he's constantly getting in her head over everything. Sometimes he's fine (probably just being nice to get her to stay) but other times he's the absolute worst. Some of his actions include:

Getting mad at her over spending time with a family-friend, and suggesting that he was trying to steal her from him (he's currently passed away). He was a super nice guy, he was like another father to me.

Saying I was retarded and autistic behind my back when I was little (I, at the time, showed signs of autism).

Drunkenly threatening divorce if she flew to the west coast to visit my brother (who hates him more than you can imagine). She ended up going, and he obviously didn't divorce, but he called her every day she was with him, which really bugged my brother (that's what husband wanted).

Essentially calling my dad useless after he had passed away (he was a very good person, he just got himself in a bad spot in life).

Being a pathological liar.

Mom owns a restaurant, and he likes to waltz around like he owns the place (he doesn't). He also insists that he can do some basic construction projects around the place, but he doesn't get to it for a long time. When mom says that she's gonna ask someone else, he gets pissed off. He just wants to tell people that he's planning on getting stuff done when he actually is not.

Very recently, he essentially lied to mom about something I said to him in a way to get pity from her, while making me look like the bad guy in the process. It was a complete lie. Fortunately, she's on my side, but all the drama ended with her getting very drunk that night and the next (guess who had to take care of her?)

This guy is a fucking nightmare. Not one person in my mom's family likes him. My brother refuses to visit her because he's around. I will probably do the same once I'm out of college in 2 years and more independent.

I can't do this anymore. My brother one of my sisters have tried to get her to leave him, to no avail, and I feel like if I don't get her to divorce by the time I'm done with college, she never will, and her life is basically ruined from that point on.

So how can I get her to realize that divorce is the only way she can get her life back?",relationship_advice
t3_chivs3,Why is getting married young so looked down on?,"I (19) love my boyfriend(21) so much. We love each other, we’ve been dating almost 3 years.

And I see so many people in bad relationships and with people that just aren’t right for them. It’s only shown me MORE how lucky I am to have my boyfriend and what a good guy he is and to never let go. We are very open with each other if something is bothering us or something is wrong we talk immediately about it. And then I also see people in relationships for so long and they just fall out of love, and that scares me bc I don’t want that. I know 3 relationships in my area who have been together as long as high school. I know the statistics aren’t in my favor but it is possible... right? Reddit makes me feel stupid for feeling like I have true love. We are like the perfect match and everyone we know always say how they think we will be together.

She currently has a boyfriend so I haven’t done anything yet but I’m starting to get unsure if I should push this or not. I started to notice that every time we go out as a group, she always pulls me to the side and makes it so we are separated from the group. Thus, my initial crush on her coming back. I asked my sister if I was just over reading because I have a crush on her or if she’s noticed somethings going on too. She told me that everyone has noticed and made jokes about us being together because she constantly wants to just be alone with me. Recently, she’s texted me privately to go shopping and get food together instead of messaging in the group chat.

t3_chit2d,My [26f] boyfriend [25m] doesn't talk to me for days when he's mad,"Okay so TL;DR, boyfriend got mad at and called me a liar because he believed I was still upset out previous argument when I got him I was in fact not upset, then got mad, came me childish, does not talk to me for 2 days.

I went on a trip with a friend last week and asked my bf of 2.5 years to watch my cat (I told him I was going on the trip maybe 4 days beforehand and reminded him the night before (it was a weekend trip, 4 hour drive). I recently moved into my first place and he lives about 15 minutes from me. He did, and even slept at my place with her while I was gone. I texted him all the time telling him how much I appreciate him for doing that that how much I missed him and loved him. 

We were texting when my friend and I were driving back home and I told him our eta was 7:50. He said cool. I asked him if he could meet me at my place for my keys (it's a gated community so I can't get in without them). He said he didn't have enough gas, and we basically argued about us doubling to his place/him meeting us. I ended it by deciding to meet him even though it meant my friend had to double back after a 4 hour drive. Traffic was a thing and the sky started pouring, so you know, delays. I told him the eta, which was now 8:50. He then freaks out and says he has to go to a thing with his brother that's first come first serve and also said that he told me this last week and that he can't wait that long. I told him that I didn't remember him telling me that/forgot and that if it was that imperative, why didn't he remind me before we left today? He got pissed off and as usual showed zero accountability and blamed me for forgetting about it and said I couldn't take the blame for forgetting even though I literally said I forgot... okay whatever. After that second argument in less than 30 minutes, he eventually apologized and I got my keys from his place (left in mailbox) and arrived home, went to bed.

I didn't get a lot of sleep during the trip, so I was feeling pretty groggy and sleep deprived the next day, but I had errands to run and my cat unfortunately can't do them for me. :( My bf called before I left seeing if we could hang out, but then an hour later he said he couldn't come by because he (still) didn't have enough gas. I simply said ""okay"" and he asked ""just okay? I feel like you aren't okay with me :/"" and I ""yeah"" and shortly after headed out. :( He was texting me on and off and I was responding while being out and about picking up furniture for my studio and whatnot. When I got back home, I was busy setting up my new pretty furniture and was texting him throughout that. When I was done, I lied down and woke up to a text from him saying:

bf: ""the gym smells like trash""

me: through tired eyes ""ew that sounds nasty and distracting""

bf: ""that was an oddly specific response lol"" 

me:""it probably is nasty and distracting though"" 

bf: ""yeah but it's a very generic/specific response lol""

me: ""okay..."" *with my best Nick Young face* 

bf: ""alright I’ve come to the conclusion that you’re not entirely okay right now with me even though you say you are"" 

me: *heavy heavy sad frustrated sigh* ""bf I just woke up from a nap and responded""

 bf: ""no gf you’ve been giving me rather dry responses all day""

me: *getting more annoyed* ""you really needed to stop looking so deep into things, I'm not wasn't upset, just feeling in a weird/zen/zombie state of mind and was running errands all day and am just tired"" 

bf: ""It’s rather convenient that you act that way after we fought but okay""

me: *over the entire conversation* ""and I was hoping you'd say, ""oh okay my bad 😅 but alas, here we are. text me when you're not upset because it seems like you're the one that still has an issue. I'm good. *shrug*

bf:"" see that’s the type of shit that makes me mad you just shrugging your shoulders like a child f this""

me: ""I'm not upset, I'm not going to lie and say I am just because you think I gave a 'specific and generic response'. so yeah, I'll shrug because I'm done arguing like I said a few weeks ago and I was so so serious. this isn't worth an argument AT ALL but you keep going rather than trusting me and taking my word and moving on with the conversation. did you have a bad day or something???? like I said, I'm pretty tired and feel kinda wonky from the sleep deprivation and have been running around all day, sue me if I'm not giving you cheerleader responses. it's like you want to be mad and argue. i'm not doing that anymore bf""

And he didn't respond and hasn't talked to me in two days as usual when he's mad.

I texted him today to please come to my place and to bring my stuff with him and he just said ""um, ok"". *sigh :(*


What do I do? Did I fuck up? This happens a LOT and I'm honestly ready to throw in the towel. We argue so much and talked about communicating better, but he does this kind of stuff all the time and won't talk to me for days. What should I say to him tomorrow? Please advise.",relationship_advice

He has a full time job, and gets really tired so he goes right to bed after work, which I understand, but I don't think 10 minutes of his time is a big deal.

t3_cgw77v,"My (32F) boyfriend (35M) got in an accident in my car, didn't tell me, and now refuses to do anything about it.","Throwaway because this shit is embarrassing af.

I have been with my (32F) boyfriend (35M) for a little over three years.

Every once in a while I will let him drive my car when his is low on gas or if he has the good parking spot and doesn't want to move etc etc. A couple weeks ago I get a call from my insurance company letting me know they need a statement about the accident.

Um. What?

After a solid 45 minutes of adamantley proclaiming this lady was full of shit and that there was no accident the insurance rep said, ""Well we have a report that (boyfriends name) was in an accident in bla bla parking lot on this date claiming he was driving his girlfriend's car"". Oh.

I call my boyfriend, he denies up and down that there was no accident. I explain the call I received and he replies with, ""ooooooh yeah I forgot about that"". Apparently he had been dodging calls for over a month and did not tell me any of this was going on. There was no damage to my car, so there was no reason for me to think anything had happened. So, yesterday I was trying to work out with the insurance company details, get him to make a statement, and its impossible. He stopped responding to my texts about the situation so I call him. He clears it. I call him again. He clears it. He texts me, ""I am with my parents."" Okay, but this is a serious situation and I need to speak with you about it can you please answer? ""I don't want to fight with you in front of my parents."" This isn't a fight, I need details about the accident from you! He won't take my call. So, I send him kind of a shitty text something along the lines of, ""You can't even show me the respect to take my call about something serious? This isn't even a real relationship to you."" Silence.

Finally after about 2 hours of radio silence (and me very very upset) I call again. He says ...

""I don't have the energy to do this with you right now. I'm painting. I don't want to talk.""

I say ...

""What about my feelings? What about me?""

He says ...

\*scoff\* ""what ABOUT you?"" and hangs up. I haven't heard from him since. I know he is waiting for me to break down and contact, as that has historically been the case.

I need some help drafting my response to this situation. I am frozen in shock and pain and am at a loss on what the next step is.

\*UPDATE\* it is 12:15pm my time, and still not a word from this fool. He gives no fucks. I am done.

t3_chkn9o,I’m (20F) bored of my SO (20M) and feel I have outgrown him.,"Hi. 

For some background, I work in a high powered environment. It is a stressful job which includes studying for a degree. It has made me have to grow up and mature, meaning I have quickly outgrown a lot of my friends. 

My SO works in a much less stressful environment. He does not have to study. He goes home and plays video games all night.

My issues began just a few weeks ago. I believe coming out of the honeymoon phase really made these stick out for me, but I’m bored of so many different things that I want to know if it’s still fixable. 

I am personally not somebody who relies on people. I enjoy my own company and am very much independent. My SO loves to be around people and wants to see me most days. I cannot do this, mainly due to studying but also because I really do just like to be on my own sometimes to catch a break. He understands when I’m studying, but doesn’t get it when I say I want a night in to myself. It results in me always going to see him, because I know that I can leave when I want to rather than have the awkward case of somebody not leaving when you want them to. 

I realise this is a me issue, but he knew about it getting into a relationship with me. 

The second biggest issue is the sex. We constantly have to have sex in his car, or in the woods or at my house, because he doesn’t want his parents to hear/never has me over when they’re not there. It’s frustrating and makes me not want to have sex with him, because it’s the risk of getting caught by police which could seriously fuck my career up. 

It feels like we are kids sneaking around rather than grown adults. He’s happy to try and dominate like an adult in the bedroom and continue with kinks I have stopped him doing before (such as choking with breath-play, which I have to hit him to get him to stop as he’s stronger than me and I can’t pull his hands away and can’t say stop) and yet he can’t realise why I don’t like getting fucked in a car. 

Not only this, but no matter when he sees me he wants sex. I just feel like he’s a horny teenager and this entire relationship revolves around him getting some. 

I just feel as though I’m bored. He’s a good guy but the longer I date him, the more I realise why I used to stick to older guys. 

Apologies for length, just want some opinions on whether this is fixable or whether anyone has gone through a similar scenario?",relationship_advice

My family has always been violently dysfunctional. My mom has always been physically abusive towards me and my oldest sister, who we'll call L, (29 F). My middle sister (24 F), we'll call her J, was somehow skipped over on the abuse. Once when I was maybe ten, I threw a tantrum and my mom started screaming at me and in an effort to get me to shut up, shoved a pillow over my head and kept it there for a few mins until J pried her off. Another time, when I was even younger she stepped on top of my stomach, and kept her foot there saying she was going to shut me up herself if I didn't stop. As L got into her teen years, she started to show the violent streak in her. Cops were called numerous times because she was screaming and breaking things in the house. She has taken a knife and swiped it around us, threatening to kill us before. She has also doused the living room in oil, held a lighter and told us she was going to set the entire place ablaze. Once she hit my other sister so hard she needed to be taken to the hospital for stitches.

When I hit my teen years, I was a bit of a self harmer and generally very angsty. Anyways I also started dating this boy when I was 15. I was stupid and I snuck him into my bedroom at night. When my mom caught us, it was hell. That entire summer, I was locked up in my house, not allowed to leave. I dont mean it dramatically. I mean she literally put a two way lock on the front door that everyone had the key to except for me. I remember when she found us, she spat on me and called me a prostitute and a hooker. She mockingly asked me if I was going to cut myself again.

L and I got two cats last year. We got into another fight a few weeks ago. Her problem was that I didn't broom everytime I scooped, like she did. I just thought it never looked dirty enough and I was the one who always took the dirty litter out. I told her fine, if she has such a problem with it then I'll put my own litter box in the communal bathroom. She said no, I wasn't allowed to do that. L showed off her violent side again. screaming expletives and saying things like ""if you put your box in this room, I swear to god I'll kill you"" and ""dont put it in there or else."" I returned her expletives in kind. She said I'd never get into medical school with my grades and I told her at least I wasn't 29, still living at home and still throwing tantrums like I was still 17. It went on for a few hours, my mom came down to kind of mediate and my sister was still screaming so I said ""at least I dont leave bottles laying around."" We are conservative and drinking isn't allowed at home. She got incredibly pissed and said ""you don't want me to start outing your secrets from this year."" My secret? I got raped. I only told my two sisters. I regret it now. She also went onto say that if I died, no one in this house would give a shit and everyone would be glad. On some level I know that she's probably right.

The fight ended with my mom taking my sisters side. She always does. My mom has always been too scared of her to have a backbone.

I tried to leave the house (it was 1 am) so I could cool down but my mom wouldn't open the door for me. She coldly told me that I the biggest mistake of her life and that she always knew I would end up a prostitute. I started screaming at her and told her that she was a horrible mother for abusing me so much and she kept saying that I was a huge mistake. So since that fight, I have been staying locked up in my room. For the first few days, I barricaded myself in with furniture because my sister has knocked my door in so many times.  

There has been a huge heat wave and we lost electricity ONLY in my room. I demanded my mom call the electricity company as my phone was dead.  She told me to stop acting crazy because it wasn't that hot (95+ degrees). She had the AC on. So I went to the main switchboard and switched off her AC to see how long she'd last. Asshole move I know. She came barreling out of her room and shrieking after about five minutes. She started screaming and again said ""why dont you just fucking die already youre not doing anyone any favors by staying here."" I said the exact same thing back to her and she kept hollering this until she went back to her room.

Its been a few days since and my sister came to pick a fight with me. She insisted my cat was using her litter box which is a fucking lie because my cat doesn't leave my room. I told her to fuck off and she started screaming as did I. I shut the door to my room and she threw something against it.

It has been almost three weeks since the first fight. I haven't left my room except for one week in between when I was on vacation. Ever since returned, I've been spending my time locked in here. I have literally lost five lbs because I can't go upstairs because everyone hates me and I'm starting to hate them. 

I dont know. I just always thought things would get better. I'm part of the problem I KNOW, but I never act like this when I'm dorming and far away from them. I swear I could've been a better person. But I lost it all somewhere along the way. When I went on vacation, I was so sad because I met such kind and wonderful people and it hurt so much that I'd never have that. I know on paper all of it doesn't sound that bad but after years and years of hearing things like this...it really just kind of kills your will to live, a little.

I read this really stupid quote once about how you should find someplace where everything tells you to stay. But I've never felt that. If anything, all I've felt is that everything in my life is telling me to leave. Nothing makes me want to stay. I don't feel anything except rage and anger when I'm home.

I don't have the financial ability to move out. The only thing I can think of is changing the locks upstairs so the entire basement is mine and I can pay my dad rent. The basement door is steel reinforced so I don't have to worry about my safety. I don't know why I should care so much about people who don't care about me. Its been a sad summer, Reddit. Nothing makes me want to stay anymore. Please help me.

tl;dr my mom and sister have been abusive most of their lives. Ive been shitty to them too. I'm miserable and don't know what to do anymore.

Does anyone with similar experiences have advice for how to deal with this situation?",relationship_advice
t3_chffdo,30 F - my BF(39) is socially awkward and it’s driving me nuts !! Help!,"So i (30F) have been with my boyfriend (39M) for 2 years now. He is the sweetest man ever, and treats me well. I love him so much. We have amazing sex too. 

But he has shortcomings and flaws that have really gotten in the way of happiness in this relationship for a while now. For one thing - although he Is really intelligent in a mathematical/ scientific and academic way, he doesn’t have the best social skills. He is definetly not shy - actually very outgoing which is good. The problem is that he seems to struggle with social cues or reading people’s reactions, As a result I can tell he sometimes annoys people with his inappropriate sense of humour, or bores people because he doesn’t know when to stop talking about something that the other person doesn’t wish to discuss in depth. He doesn’t necessarily always know how to have social / leisurely conversations with people. He has trouble cooperating with a group dynamic. Many people are too kind to say so. Some of our friends even tease him a lot, but I don’t even think they are joking a lot of the time.  He even got kicked out of his gaming group. 

I hate this because I want him to get along with people. I’m really shy and have a lot of trouble making friends or keeping acquaintances. So I don’t want him to scare the ones I do have away or make them not want to hang out as much. I feel really uncomfortable sometimes when he is there and like I can’t relax because I’m worried what he will say or do next which will embarrass me.  My family likes him because they think he’s sweet and have somewhat learned to accept his quirks. Mostly I think they are doing it to make me happy. 

To give an example of what he might do: one day He said a really weird thing to me and my brother at a terrible time. We went to the vet because we unfortunately had to put down our cat which was really sad for us. My boyfriend was sweet and offered to come, and he drove us there and stayed while we waited. I see this and acknowledge the good part he played, but somehow in the exam room, he started to go on about some politically charged topic regarding a woman trying to make a dramatic link between abortion and masturbation. I still don’t even understand what he was on about- but it was really stupid because we were grieving and I was really pissed  off. my brother even though he likes my BF agreed it was really weird. I told my bc to stop talking about it, and he did, but I hate that I have to TELL him this stuff! I just want to relax  and live my life and trust him to not do that stuff. 

And in some circumstances, I really need him. And he doesn’t always get that I need support or how he should give it. I think he eventually always comes through... but I need to explain it before he does. This I think I can cope with - but not the aforementioned social awkwardness. It’s getting exhausting! And it’s taking away from the other wonderful qualities he has. 

I find myself having to repeatedly have these discussions with him. And I’m becoming this controlling person which I hate! I think he might have some kind of ADHD, or aspergers - I don’t know! But how can I talk to him
About this ??? 

I love him and I want to make this work, but I don’t know how ! Or if I should. 

I’m feeling so sad because I want to marry this man and have children. I know he would be a good dad, and he is the sweetest person. But this has to change. It’s driving me nuts!!! 

Any advice on how to speak to him about this? I want to try and talk to him in the least hurtful way.",relationship_advice
t3_chimbi,I love my best friend should I tell him?,"I'm 26(f) and my best friend is 24(m). We have been friends since I was 12 and he was 10. I apologize if this isn't the correct sub for my question. I've seen him go from a boy to a man. He has helped me a lot in life and we have been there for each other when times were tough. Just this year he sent me money because my dog needed surgery to save her life he was my last hope. Hes stationed in Afghanistan currently he found a way to get the money to me to save her life. Over the years we have always stayed in contact and typically talk on a daily bases sometimes for hours. Anytime he has had a gf it has broken my heart but I could never tell him. Hes only had two ""serious"" relationships when he was with them (separate times) he loved them but there was always something in the way for them to love him fully. He always tells them about me  I am not a threat because I'm unfortunately fat and ugly. They do understand I come first. Its not one of those things were the guy has a female best friend and another woman feels like hes cheating or something crazy like that we have only ever been friends nothing more. The other two women had separate issues which would take a long time to explain but I can go into detail if needed. I myself don't date because being around him for so long has set the bar very high for me as to what I like in a man. I want to tell him I like him but I am terrified I'll ruin our friendship. Because of his personality he doesn't tell woman he likes them the last woman that was in love with him told him how she felt and he thought about it and realized he liked her as well its weird I know ha. I feel like if I tell him he'll mediate on it and realize he doesn't like me like that. He mediates on things because he has always said a relationship is built its not created. Meaning he looks to see if both people were equal in making it before something started. I hope all of this makes sense. I was thinking maybe I could lose weight become pretty and when hes out of the military I'd tell him I like him. I don't know I know it sounds like an odd situation.",relationship_advice
t3_chkklh,My (22M) gf (20f) is becoming more unstable the longer we’re apart and it’s ruining our relationship,"My gf and I are in a long distance relationship and have been for a little over a year.  We talk everyday and skype often and we were even planning on one of us flying over to one another, we have been flip flopping who goes where first as of now.  Everything is great when it’s great but, especially this week, they have become awful when they’re not.  She struggles with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and has been before I knew her due to a past relationship and I have done everything I believe I can from my location.  As of now she has not received any psychiatric help on any of this, though I have been encouraging her to schedule for almost a year now.  She has made an appointment but she didn’t go because she took a shift at work after the fact and has not rescheduled.  Knowing her, she may be avoiding it.  We have broken up because I felt that her mental health was causing a rift between us and that she wasn’t doing anything about it, but that didn’t last.  We both spoke again and we promised that we would try to start over and fix everything and make it work.  After that, everything went great for about 2 weeks.  

Situations elevated when I have had to cancel a flight we had planned because out of all days to have it, my dad has surgery on the Thursday I would have returned and that is something I need to be there for.  Things have gone down hill since and she has become more unstable.  She will be fine and then she will dwell on feelings of separation and fear of another canceled ticket.  She often says that she needs to walk outside way after midnight and that she is leaving her phone at home, which i can understand for some but in these states of mind I worry.  She declines calls or she ignores them altogether and refuses to speak to me in this state.  She has told me that she wants to die and that she may not come home, which is something i take seriously so I’m immediately there for her, but at times I have a feeling I am enabling this behavior.  This has been taking a toll on my mental health hearing the one i love the most wanting to die over and over.  

Just the other day, I told her I needed to pick my sister up and that I was getting her mcdonalds, she texted me if i still want to be with her while i was driving, so I couldn’t answer.  Next i get a “okay fine i get it” and then several texts saying that she might not show up for work because she might kill herself.  My sister believes it’s manipulative and i just don’t want to believe that, but its a thought that sneaks on me.  It especially has me almost believes she’s manipulating me when she says things like “i love you forever,” “i hope that we stay together and get married,” after we make up on the bad days because i think she is solidifying that I may be stuck here.  This has happened 4 out of the last 7 days and I don’t see it getting better any time soon.  I don’t want to believe she is manipulating me but a lot is pointing towards my worst nightmare.  I don’t know how to deal with this situation and I know I have to leave for my own sake but I don’t know what she will do.  I feel drained and lost and I’m typing this right after another situation.  I apologize if this is hard to read, I didn’t proofread it but I am desperate at this point.  I feel lost now

t3_chfcni,Girlfriend broke up with me,"Hi, I'm 18 and i was in a long distance relationship, we were doing good yesterday, then she told me her ex added her on snapchat, she asked if she can text him and ask him why he added her, i said yea its fine. They got to talking, i told her to juss ask him get her answer and then unadd him and stop talking, she didnt do that, i logged in her snapchat account, seen that they were having full conversation with each other, she didnt like me logging into her account all of a sudden and changed her password which made me feel like she was hiding sumthing. So she told me she unadded him and by that point when i got her new password i logged in and i couldnt see the messages anymore since she unadded him, hours pass and we were cooling down from arguing about that, we were going to hop on a game we play together at night when all of a sudden she decided she didn't wanna play anymore and i said alright and she texted me outta nowhere saying ""i dont think im ready for a relationship"" because she needs to ""love herself first"" which i understand we've talked about breaking up to figure stuff out within ourselves before, but she broke up with me hours after she talked to her ex so i assumed she did it because they started talking, i started coming up with possible scenarios in my head, one scenario popped up and that was maybe she exchanged numbers with him and thats why she didnt want me to see her messages with him on snapchat, so i asked her a couple hours later if thats what happened and she said yeah, she said after they got off snapchat, he gave her his number and she unblocked him off her phone and he texted her on there about 2 hours after they got done talking on snapchat, she lied and said they stopped when she unadded him, she didnt tell me she was still talking to him it took for me to pry it out of her. She didn't want to tell me because she feared she would lose me. 

So now lets get to the point as to why she's still talking to him, we got on the phone last night after i blocked her on everything she ended up emailing me asking for me to call her, so i did, she was crying, she confessed to not being completely over him, she said her reason for talking to him is so it can help her get over him, which i dont see how that will help, she says she wants answers as to why he pretty much didn't treat her right towards the end of their relationship, she said she tried talking to him about it when they were on the phone last night and he even told her ""its the past let it go"" but she says she cant let it go. She says she cant get over him because ""it's prolly cuz he's my first love"". She says they dont want to be together, they told each other that supposedly, but i asked if there's a chance they might and she said ""i cant predict the future but as of rn all i know is i dont wanna be with him"" which tells me there is a slight possibility that there might be a chance of them getting back together. So today we was arguing about that.  And she ended up blocking me because i was being ""negative"" about it and ""not supportive AT ALL"" with it. She said this isnt the end for us but i find it extremely hard to believe she's going to get over him anytime soon considering he's still going to be in her life now. I just can't understand how talking to sumone you've been broken up with for months almost a year, and who didn't/doesn't care to talk about anything with you is gonna help anyone get over sumone. I can't understand how dealing with sumone, having sumone who caused you pain and who ur still in love with is going to help you get over them.",relationship_advice
t3_chaq10,My [27F] roommate [31F] submitted my personal information to a 'big data' collection site without my consent and I don't know how to approach her about this and other issues,"We have a unique-ish living situation in which I own the apartment we live in, so my mortgage is subsidized by her renting the room. In other words, it's not a traditional landlord-tenant relationship and although I've been very transparent with her and fair with her in our ""lease"", as I understand it, it doesn't fall under tenant protection laws. We've lived together for two and a half years and she is moving out next week, I believe.

She has been struggling with a drug addiction for many years (I've gathered from numerous conversations) and the past 8 months or so she's gotten really bad. I've noticed her gone all night, weeknights even, staying in bed all day, calling in sick on Mondays, missing social events with my family (we've grown close since she moved here from far away). I tried numerous things - giving her space by staying with my bf, inviting her out and trying to be home more, then taking her on a day trip to talk (nothing talked about), planning a trip away that she agreed to and then bailed on - but she grew increasingly distant and shortened our interactions as much as she could to the point where she got downright rude. Slamming doors, sighing loudly whenever I was in a common area, talking loudly in her room on her phone about me, shit like that.

Finally months later she asked to talk about something that was bothering her and we did. Then she immediately became ""cool"" with me again once she felt heard. Said it wasn't a problem. I then proceeded to ask her a number of questions about her behaviour, which she deflected. She ""didn't want to know"" what she's like intoxicated. She would work on herself in her own way.

It became very clear to me from that conversation that she was interested only in herself and partying, she made it clear she 'doesn't really think about' me and is 'happier than ever'. She described how she's emotionally void of feelings. I explained that I'm quite the opposite, I've been worried sick about coming home to find her OD'd or getting a call that she's in hospital or dead. I think she was trying to bluff but she said she had been considering moving out for a couple months now, and then had a look of ""oh shit"" when I said that would be best for both of us. I don't think she realized I was 1) going to ask her to move out anyways and 2) was not dependent on her specifically to afford my place. This apartment is my home and my trust is broken, I don't want to come home feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome in my own space. I would rather struggle financially for a bit than continue to provide a space in which she can afford this party lifestyle. I don't support her drug habit.

Anyways, there was no movement on her moving out. In fact she 180'd and tried really hard to be my friend again and acted like she was sticking around. Then a month later she 180'd back to being rude and distant. I messaged her when she was late paying rent and she replied that she ""hadn't got around to it"" to which I asked when she was planning to move out and she replied with a very vague timeline. So I said I'd prefer July 31st and she agreed. It has since been very awkward, she stays out most of the time, only talks to my boyfriend when she's home.

About two weeks ago I recieved an email from this tenant screening company.  They said she had listed me as her landlord, with our address. So immediately I'm annoyed, because she didn't ask me if it was ok to be a reference. I have never, ever, ever, been contacted by someone to provide a reference without prior knowledge. To me that's like the basic level of respect you owe someone, ask if it's ok to give their information out. 

I dragged my feet a bit but then said fuck it, if it means her finding a place and being gone, then I should do it. So I filled out the form and at the end it said the standard ""by submitting you are agreeing to our privacy policy"". So I open the privacy policy and was floored by what I was agreeing to. I said absolutely not, then replied to the original email and said I have no problem providing a reference but no way am I agreeing to you keeping this info. Which opened a can of worms.

Right now, I'm waiting for this company to ""scrub"" my information from their system and I'm trusting they do this. They were pretty clear that she had consented to having my consent to give this information. I'm trying to contain myself but I'm absolutely livid that she put me in this situation. Yes, she probably didn't even think twice about it. But that doesn't make it ok, especially since the property doubles as my home, and now some database somewhere may still have my full name and physical address and email. If she had just asked, I would have felt better knowing I agreed to it, but to find out this had been given away without my consent is infuriating for me.

I want to talk to her about this at the very least, and explain how wrong it is. I am open to maybe also putting into words how much these drugs take away from her life and how shitty of a person they make her, but I don't even know where to begin because I've never had to deal with an addiction situation. She doesn't do well with face to face, so I am thinking it best to write her a message once she leaves. Not looking for a reply or acknowledgement, and I'm especially not looking to repair the friendship. It's too far gone. The privacy invasion situation is mostly taken care of, but I do want to let her know it would be best she always asks for someone's permission before giving out their information.

So, what can I say that will allow us both to move on and go our separate ways, and possibly give her some insight to what she's done to me so she doesn't repeat this situation with another person? Because I do mean well for her, I want her to get better and change and grow. I just don't want to be taken advantage of anymore. 

Or should I say nothing at all?",relationship_advice
t3_chkj44,help with sadness and pain (18M),"i’m in college and towards the end of my freshmen year met this amazing girl (21f) who really hit it off with but didn’t make official or make moves or anything 

for a month during the summer we talked and eventually started facetiming like every night for 2 hours at a time and got really close. eventually she visited me (2 hr plane) paid for hotel, stayed there w me and we ended up doing stuff. i asked her to be my gf the last night and thought she was the one.

for the last month now we’ve been doing long distance. i really thought everything was perfect, texting and calling, but then this week she’s in NY for work and has been super busy and tired. i was getting worried about the less calls and all day no responses so called her yesterday, i asked if i did anything wrong but she said no, then she suddenly started saying all these issues in our relationship like she doesn’t feel i know the real her and she doesn’t want me to depend on her and she’s been faking cute sometimes and is sick of me being cutesy sometimes 

today i was really sad and depressed. couldn’t really do much. is it my fault for wishing she texted back within the day? she posted on insta today of some stories of eating out with her work friends but didn’t reply to my text from morning. i got really sad and deleted all my social media. i’m taking this rlly hard because it’s my first real relationship and i don’t it to all go to shit because that’s what it’s starting to feel like 

i just think that no matter how busy i am i would at least text her because she’s that important to me. maybe i’m not to her. i’m thinking of asking her for a break until we see each other in person in a month at school. i’m just tired of drinking myself to sleep and tired of feeling lonely and insecure.

When I met him we hit it off instantly and he asked for my phone number because he wanted some ‘help with work’ but I knew it was really so he could get closer with me. We hung out a lot and he spent the night in my dorms a few days. We basically started dating and my feelings for him have gottena lot stronger.

Then I found out that he’s not even 18 yet. He’s so young and I am much older than him. I’m kind of scared of facing judgement from other, but I also feel guilty now.

t3_chihxc,How to contact a childhood friend of the family without being weird?,"I don’t know how to phrase it, so apologies if it’s long winded -

When I was a kid, my uncle’s bestfriend had a son a few years older than me (not 100% sure, but I’m 22, and he’s *probably* 24 or 25). I only saw him at parties growing up, and never really thought anything of it.

My aunt has these stories of things I don’t remember - when I was two he hid all the balloons from me, and I went and burst them all and made him cry. When I was a bit older (like 6-7), he used to follow me around sometimes, apologising for his sister “annoying” me. His sister was a year younger than me, and my cousin’s best friend, so at parties we’d play together. He used to always go out of his way to be nice to his sister if it involved me, and he asked my dad permission to talk to me when I was being moody.

I don’t remember when I stopped seeing him, but I was roughly 11-13? Over the years, my aunt brought up stories about him and his sisters, like when they graduated school, when he graduated college, got a job etc. I know he was bullied quite bad as a teenager, and it made him extremely shy and not very sociable.

When I went to university, I moved in with my aunt and uncle. I saw him again when I was 17 and realised he’d gotten really cute. I only saw him for a few minutes here and there over the years when he dropped his dad over, or picked him up. I moved to another country when I was 21 for uni, and when I came back wasn’t living with them anymore.

For some reason he’s been on my mind a lot lately, like random dreams and random thoughts. I can’t find him on social media, I couldn’t even find his sister (my cousin would give me his sisters contact info if I asked, but then I’d have to ask her).

My aunt loves to gossip, so I can’t really ask her. She’s really nosy, so when I was like 17 and he’d been over she’d ask if I thought he was handsome (she does this with all unrelated males). She also had a list of potential friends-of-the-family that she imagined me or my cousins marrying - because of course she did.

From her gossip it’s very likely he’s single (and I genuinely just want to talk and maybe figure out wtf I’m thinking about). I think he (probably) had a crush on me as a kid too. I’m too embarrassed to say something to my aunt or uncle, and my cousins are male so I’m not going to mention it. I feel like there’s some missing connection with my childhood and why he’s on my mind - doesn’t necessarily even mean like relationships. My aunt is the type who’d call his mum (she’s gossipy too) and order wedding catalogues if I even mentioned his name (she bought me a box to store an engagement ring for my 21st even though I’m very young and very single). I’m living with them again, so he might randomly show up again at the house. I also don’t want to seem creepy if I did contact him.

Tl;dr - had a childhood friend/acquaintance who I’d like to contact. I don’t strictly mean it in a relationship way, but it’s possible. He doesn’t have social media, and my family are crazy gossips so I’m not sure how to non-creepily contact him.",relationship_advice

He said it was cool, but then a couple of days later, he made a depressing post on a Snapchat story complaining that he’s not good enough for people no matter how hard he tries.  I got the impression that I inadvertently caused his online meltdown, and I haven’t said anything about it yet, but I’m debating if I should.

t3_chkhpg,Can i trust him?,"

Can you give me your honest opinion on this situation?

My bf and i have been together for 10months. He is the sweetest and most loving person, he involves me in his gatherings with family with friends and tries his best to be involved with mine. Our lifes are very intertwined cus we make effort to be together. And he is with me everyday

But he has this past with this woman for mayb close to 4 years. The woman is still married with kids, however they started this affair because the woman feels very unhappy with her marriage but in the end she decided that she will not go through with divorce for her kids and she has formed a bond with her husband’s family. So they ended the affair. But my bf loved her and told her that he will take care of her if ever she decides to leave his husband. He told me all of these before we got together and that they were past it now they are friends and she is supportive of him finding happiness in someone like me.

But i’ve always been abit mindful and uncomfortable of how often they text each other. Actually mayb just afew exchanges thru the week

However afew weeks ago..  he left his phone at home for about 3 hrs and i decided to snoop which is very bad! I am not proud but i did it. And i found that.. even tho he hasnt been meeting her and there was nthg physical. . But he did mention things like she was very impt to her and she would update him on her life and complaints about the husband and send my bf selfies. 

And i even saw him say  that she is still important to her that he will always have her in her heart and his relationships will always be dysfunctional because he has her. 

I was sososo upset and I confronted him. He told me that she was in a bad place and bad marriage and he didnt want her to feel alone. That everyhinng he has said to her was a lie. That there were no longer any romance and that he’d never leave me for anyone or anything. He also promised that he will stop contacting her. 

But he did clarify things with her by saying that he has intention to marry me and that ive made him feel whole again. And she did seem supportive

He has been assuring me everyday since it happened last month.

Can i believe him?

Can i believe him when he says he has no feelings for her. Just that he was trying to let her down slowly? That he rlly only has me in his heart? When he says that he will never consider a future without me.

t3_chkh6n,How do I help my friend leave her abusive relationship?,"I (22f) have a wonderful friend (26F). She has been with her boyfriend for about 7 years and we’ve been friends for about 4 years. They live with his parents about a 2 hour plane ride from me so I see my friend a few times a year at best and her boyfriend even less. He seems a good guy but he’s pretty shy and has quite bad social anxiety so I haven’t really had too much to do with him. Anywho. 
Mid last year, my friend (let’s call her Amy) was in her and her boyfriends bedroom and was giving it a good clean when she discovered a camera hidden near the dresser. She got a funny feeling as her boyfriend’s dad had been acting sort of funny for the last 9 weeks or so. She didn’t say how exactly just that he was not quite right. She put two and two together and confronted her boyfriends dad. He was filming her getting changed and also confessed to filming her in the shower and toilet. She was completely horrified, devastated, upset, as one would be! Her boyfriends mum was shocked and told her husband to get the hell out and not come back till she said so. He did so. The boyfriend never said much about it and would get upset when asked what he thought. The mum did her best to support Amy and after a week or so the dad came back home, apologised and started some sort of therapy. Boyfriend convinced Amy not to press charges but the mum said she would understand if Amy did. Time went on and everyone kind of brushed it off and it was never really talked about, the therapy ended and no more was said but Amy has not trusted the dad since and is still really shaken. 
Anyway. 
I got home a few hours ago and had a message from Amy saying things had exploded (she didn’t say what exactly happened) but the incident had came up and her boyfriend and dad told her to get over it, harden up, etc. the mum was disgusted and took Amy to the supermarket so they could have a chat. The boyfriend wants to break up with Amy because she can’t get over what happed and is so uncomfortable being in the same house as the dad (all very understandable). For tonight, the dad is staying elsewhere and Amy is still there. Amy’s Mum lives close to me but she’s very mentally unwell and toxic, her dad lives in another country and there isn’t any relationship there. I’ve offered her to come stay with me, said I’d help with the plane fee and pick her up any time from airport if she can pack a bag and get here. She can stay with me as long as needed, away from her (IMO) shitty boyfriend and his dad. But she’s reluctant and doesn’t want to cause waves. (Note- I was in a bad relationship when I was 17 and I was hit, raped etc and eventually managed to leave) so I know the dilemma and the feelings, to an extent anyway. 
Reddit- how do I help Amy leave her crappy boyfriend? I’m so so worried for her; she’s so so unhappy there and is afraid of what the dad will do next (I am too). Any advice is greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_chkfcr,23[F] girlfriend talkin with other guy,"Edit: Thank you for the answers.I want to give some additional info.I am sure she is not cheating and that i am not plan B.We are always going out and sleeping either at her place or at mine.She wouldn't have time to meet up with him.

I am not doubting her being faithful, i am doubting what she feels about the relationship and i cannot grasp her reasons for talking with the dude.
Does she like the attention? Does she like to feel wanted?That guy was kinda mean and somewhat rejected her, does she do it to get payback?

She said she is 100% sure she doesn't like him and she is doing things like planning trips for 3-4 months in the future, i met all of her friends , went on double dates and she said she is going to tell her parents about us and asked if i will tell mine.She offered to lend me a pretty big amount of money for a couple of months like it was no big deal (i am in some trouble with money and just started pursuing a masters degree and have to pay the university taxes).
 It looks like she is serious, or am i just a blind moron?

My first instinct was to just distance myself emotionally and continue in a very cautious manner.But i wouldn't want to screw up the relationship for something that might not mean anything.

Any other opinions?Anyone had this happen to them?I am in a really bad place and don't know what to do.

Thanks again for the replies!

Hello, throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Tl;dr: gf replies to guy she used to hook up with who contacts her on messenger, what's your take on this?

So, as the title says, my[26M]  gf [23F] talks on messenger with a guy she used to hook up it and i don't know how i feel about it.

We are in an exclusive relationship for 4 months, and this has been going on since the start.
 
The first time i saw her texting him, i asked her about it and she says that if it bothers me, she can stop it because they were never friends or anything like it.I don't think controlling who she talks with is a good idea and it gives a bad vibe so i told her it's ok, as long as she is honest about it.

She used to tell me when he would message her, but i got visually upset because he would ask her to come over to his place, and a little teasing would go on between us.

The thing is, she says she never contacts him first, and i trust her.She also told me that in the beginning (first 1-3 weeks of us being together) she still felt something for him, but it went away.

We would just joke about it, until this week, when i saw her talking to him at 1 in the morning while she was at my place.That's when it really bothered me, i am sure she wouldn't have told me about it if i hadn't seen it, she even tried to hide it i think.

She told me again she didn't feel anything for him and that she won't reply to him anymore if i want that, but she did it in a pretty irritated tone.Again, i said there is no need to do that.

Now, what bothers me is that she keeps replying to him, i shouldn't have to tell her to stop, i think this should come from her.I don't understand why she keeps replying to his messages and i don't know what to do about it.

I am taken 2-3 steps back everytime i find out she is talking to him.I love her, but i am starting to lose feelings because of this.I know he never had a major impact on her, they hooked up 3-4 times, but never had sex.We were good friends before being together and she told me that before we started dating.
 
How should i go about this?why does she keep replying to him?should i tell her to stop?",relationship_advice
t3_chfy6z,I [22F] met my online friend of 4 years [25M] in person for the first time and caught major feelings and now I don't know what to do with myself.,"I met this guy on one of those stupid chatting apps in 2015, and we have been close friends ever since.  There have been ups and downs/periods of talking more or less/etc., but we have consistently been in contact the whole time.  I have always thought that maybe I liked him, and at some points I thought maybe he liked me too.  There has always been sexual chemistry, and we would flirt, etc. during times both of us were single at the same time.  We have both seen other people throughout our time being online friends. 

This past weekend, I traveled across America to meet him, and it was honestly an amazing weekend.  He was even better than I thought he'd be irl and we both agreed it was a ""transformational"" weekend for both of us.  The only thing is... now that I'm home, I miss him so goddamn much it hurts.  I told him that I had strong feelings for him, and he said that he thought I was amazing too, but logistically it would be very hard for us to actually be more than friends for the time being.  He is always traveling between two states for school, and has no idea where he will ultimately end up, I just started a career where I am... it would just be really hard.  The end date would be near impossible to define at this point and I don't really know if I could handle it either. 

I just don't know what to do with myself.  I want a chance to be with him but it's impossible.  I can't be where he is right now, and vice versa.  We both made a pact to work on improving ourselves, and I can't help but feel like I want to do it for him.  I don't even know what kind of advice I'm asking for necessarily, I just need someone to help me make sense of my feelings.

TL;DR - I met my online friend of 4 years in person and may be in love with him, but it's logistically not possible to be together right now and I'm losing my mind.",relationship_advice
t3_chibd0,My Fiancé of 6 Years is Drinking Again,"TLDR down the bottom.

To start off I want to give a little background about myself. I’m from a family where my mother was/still is an extreme alcohol abuser. She was like this my whole life and once I got out of the home I promised myself I would not go back to that. 
Due to that, I’ve always wanted to have a partner that would have a healthy relationship with alcohol, or even better not drink at all. I met my fiancé 6 years ago and she was a non-drinker when we first started dating.

However, when things started progressing she started to drink a little more, but nothing that seriously bothered me. It was usually at social occasions. But then things changed again, she would get incredibly drunk at social occasions and started to drink a couple wines after work. I love her so much so I was willing to look past it and at that time we were in our early-to-mid twenties so I kind of brushed of my feelings as unreasonable and to let her be, as she was still young and should enjoy life.

Just to let everyone know she knows more than anyone the expanse of my mothers alcohol abuse and what had happened to me when I was younger. She also knows my stance on alcohol and I have brought it up to her several times that I didn’t really like her drinking alcohol. But things remained the same with her drinking until about a year and a half ago when I noticed she was drinking too much (IMO). My breaking point was when I noticed she was drinking more than a bottle of wine a night. There were times I would come home from work (I work late shifts at a factory) and she would be drunk all by herself. Every time we had a party she was the drunkest girl there. It was too much, I sat her down and said she needed to change or I will end things with her. I felt it was harsh but it’s my true feelings. I really don’t want this to be my life and I honestly have zero patience with alcohol.
She promised me she would change, but after a week of reduced drinking she was back at it again. I tried to end things with her, but she begged me to stay and promised that she will change. She promised she would stop drinking during the day and even stop drinking at social occasions if I wanted that. She said that she didn’t really envision herself as a mother in the future being a drinker (we were thinking about having kids after we were married). After all this I relented and gave her a second chance, I felt she was the love of my life.
Which brings us to now, it’s been four months and she’s being sneaky, drinking when I’m not home. She tries to cover up the evidence, but I can smell it on her and also it’s hard not to see the empty wine bottles in the trash. Mind you it’s not as bad as it was before. I noticed it was about a glass here and there during the week. And in about three weeks that changed to about maybe 2 or 3 in a night. She’s also drinking during social occasions, but again not as bad before. When it started it was a glass or two at a party, but last time at a family function she had about a bottle of wine to herself.
I honestly do not know what to do. Am I over reacting about this? It’s not as bad as it was last time, but I really don’t want to look back at this point in time a year or so from now wishing I had done something about it and just left. Please give me your advice, it will be much appreciated.

TLDR: my fiancé was drinking a lot and I asked her to stop. She didn’t then I broke up with her. She promised to change and then I took her back, but now she’s drinking again, some drinks during the night.",relationship_advice

t3_chkavi,A guy (21M) just told me (21M) I'm his closest friend and I feel like I've been dishonest to him,"I transferred in to a different college last year, and so I've known him for a year or so. I met him pretty early, and since then we've had mutual friends but never really hung out just us. He seemed like a good dude so I made efforts to become good pals with him. Even then, I wouldn't see him around every day cuz we're doing different courses but over the past year he's been one of the few people I feel that I can trust and be real with.

&amp;#x200B;

my one gripe is that he's fairly quiet and doesn't share things, stories or feelings as readily and openly as I do ( even when I prompt him to), so I don't know as much about him as he knows about me. makes me feel like i've just used him as an ear without providing anything in return. few days ago he told me out of the blue that I'm his closest friend, and I said likewise. I guess he's mine too? Like I tell him the most stuff and am the most real with him, but I don't even interact with him often at all. Out of the people that I consider my friends he's for sure the nicest guy and knows the most about me but he's not the most fun or the person i have the most laughs with; its quiet sincere with us although we joke around sometimes. Our friendship has pretty much only consisted of talking and gymming sometimes and we haven't really gone out and done things.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel that thing where i'm like 'yeah he's my bestie' and so I feel like ive been dishonest with him in that regard. Now that he's told me he feels im his closest friend I feel this strange guilt and obligation when we hang out.

&amp;#x200B;

t3_chftvz,My (27f) boyfriend (29m) and I are on separate wavelengths when it comes to communication and how we process anger. He left me on a hike and doesn't see the issue,"
This is a huge ramble and to be honest I don't know what I'm looking for but here we go. 
Me and my boyfriend have been dating for a few years now and for the most part it's been pretty breezy, but over the last year things have gone south. We went out for a day in our local forest. We got into an argument about something small, me having the object he wanted to use. He got mad that I sat in the middle of the small river (maybe 10 feet across) on a rock and had the thing we were both using. He never onced asked for them. When I looked back to him after 5-10 minutes of using it, he called me selfish and thoughtless for not giving them to him sooner. He then got dressed, packed his stuff, and left me in the woods while he walked to the trailhead. When I got upset about him leaving me alone, he says he had every right to leave and I should have asked him to stop if I wanted him to. Never did I think a significant other, friend, or whomever, would leave someone like that. That's something that I would never do, no matter how mad I am at them. It seems excessively cruel to do to someone you love. The subject came up unexpectedly a few days later with me crying, saying how hurt and humiliated I was by him walking away from me like he did. He said that I treated him like shit at the river and by my not asking him to not walk away was me being complacent. He essentially said I gave my permission for him to walk away by not stopping him. I don't know what to do at this point. Anytime we argue, everything appears to be my fault. And he says that everything is my fault because I'm an asshole. I don't think someone can be wrong every time, though? 

He can be so caring and loving, but will rarely apologize for hurting my feelings in situations like this. I shut down if someone raises their voice or curses at me during an argument. He knows this. However any time we argue he continues to curse and yell, and If I bring up that he's yelling, he will say it is not the right time to bring it up and say I'm changing the subject to myself instead. If I bring it up at a later date like he says he wants me to do instead, the conversation goes nowhere and it's back to me being selfish. And I apologize for ever bringing it up. I don't know where to do from here. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells most of the time. Is there any saving this? I love him to death and want nothing except to make him happy, but I feel like I'm losing parts of myself. Is there a way to resolve this? Any tips on how to improve communication?",relationship_advice
t3_chi8bo,WINTAH To want more money cross post.,"I posted this in Am I the Asshole and was suggested to ask you fine folk as well. Fixed the title but direct copy paste of the post below. 

.........

Well Reddit, longtime lurker who loves this subreddit and on mobile, please have mercy.

So I know I shouldn’t do it, but I did business with family. I bought a house for my sister and her now ex to live in. They have paid under market rent for years. Now she wants to buy it and our mother has gotten involved and is orchestrating the sale. Mom wants me to sell the house just above expenses so sister can afford it. She says I would make a lot more should I sell it to a stranger but ‘I’m not trying to make a profit off my sister’

I’m torn, I’m not set to lose money on the sale, but sister would get a lot of house value out of the sale.

Here is the kicker, she is a single mom with a son with autism. I have a good paying job and do not have financial issues. The profit for the house would be a bigger deal for her than me.

So, WIBTHA for wanting more of a fair deal than just getting what would have been interest from keeping the money in the bank.

........

So the question I pose is, do I take the lower price and keep the peace in the family, or stand up for myself and ask for a fairer deal and risk causing problems?",relationship_advice
t3_chi8ae,Am I (22F) in a one-sided relationship with my partner (24M) or am I expecting too much from him?,"My partner and I have dated for over a year now. I love him and I know he loves me, but there's a few things that are weighing on me lately. I feel like I make a real effort to show him how I feel. I tell him how much I love him and little things like buying treats I know he likes when I go shopping to show I'm thinking of him. The thing is, it doesn't feel reciprocated. I honestly get so sad listening to romantic songs and watching romantic movies because the guy is always saying that he would do anything to show his girl how much he loves her, but I feel like I have to jump through hoops just to get my partner to do anything like that for me. I have talked to him about this before, and I've expressed that I wish he would be romantic with me or at least just reassure me more that he loves me. He just says he's not good at the romance stuff and he'll try harder, but nothing ever changes. 

Another thing is that I just don't really feel like I fit into his life. I really do understand that people are busy and people in relationships have their own lives as well. It's just that it's always seeming like he will choose anything else over me. Whether it's working out, hanging with his roommates, or anything else outside of work. He'll say something like ""I'll pick you up after I shower"" but 2 hours later and he texts ""sorry, I was hanging with my roommates and got caught up"" (or insert anything else he was doing that wasn't showering.) 

I guess my main issue is just that I am not feeling validated enough in this relationship. I have always thought that when you really love someone that much you would make small sacrifices to make sure they know you love them, because I know I have all the time with him. Right now it just seems like he wants to live in his own life and that I'm just a small part of it. I don't feel like a priority to him and I don't feel like he understands how much it would mean to me for him to show a little more affection.

My question is, am I just overreacting?? Am I expecting too much? Or, is it fair to be upset in my situation? I can definitely accept if I just need to chill out and let these things go, but on the other hand this has been making me sad and I don't want to stay in a relationship where I don't feel like it's 50/50 effort-wise if there's something better out there in the future. Any advice is appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_chgt65,Do I need to get a new ring before I propose again?,"First post so apologies if I make a mistake but I just wanted to ask some advice.

I proposed to my girlfriend about 4 months ago. I surprised her the night before she was going away for a couple of weeks to see her family so I thought it would be a great time so she could tell her family about it. We have talked about marriage and it was both something we want.

The night I proposed I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. She got very emotional and cried but shook her head and said no. She was sorry but just couldn't do it. She went on her trip and we didn't speak much at all for the month that she was gone. I was pretty devastated at the rejection and I cried most nights she was gone.

When she came back we talked it over. She said she was sorry but just needed space to deal with everything. She said she was not in a good mental place at the time due to stress and work, which is why she wanted to take the month away at her parents to recharge (I didn't know this, she just said it was for a visit). She said she was not in the headspace to say yes, and that saying no just made it worse for her.

To make a long story short, things are great with us now. We are still together, she is in a much better place and still wants to get married. We have had a lot of time to talk it all through. She said that next time I ask she will say yes. So, I am back to planning to propose to her again.

Where I would like some advice, is do I need to get a new ring, since I already proposed with the other ring? It was pretty expensive (at least to me) and it will take me a while before I can save enough to afford another one. Would it be ok if I propose again if I don't have a ring, or does it ruin the moment? 

Any suggestions or advice? Thank you

t3_cgzhxo,Update My gf was caught cheating I am turning the tables on her before she blames me.,"Thank you for the kind support. This whole thing got out of hand. I never responded to questions or posted again on FB after initial posts. That kind of back fired on me as friends were asking questions on FB then calling, texting, some even dropped by the apt. The original thought was let the pictures do the talking. Then my FB for my Photography  Business, in my name, was under assault from well wishers and those that wanted  to know more. So I shut it all down. That has turned the spigot not all the way off but to a trickle now. I did not know I knew so many people.

You kind people asked for an update so here it goes. I went no contact with now ex as far as text and phone. I hid out next door the last 2 nights. I then blocked ex and her best friend on FB so they could not post anything on my page. This was yesterday. The best friend picked up her stuff. There really wasn't alot. I was waiting for her to say she didn't get her 70 in tv back or some madeup shit like that but it did not happen. 

When I got home tonight she was in the parking lot waiting for me alone. We sat in my car and talked. She wanted to go inside but I said no. She apologized for being stupid. This whole thing started about few weeks ago when the 30 days should have been up. I had called her about extending it a while longer. Even though she said she was ok she was really depressed because we had not been doing things together except for the wedding shoots. Her girl friend suggested that she tag along with her and her bf. She did, thats when she met the boyfriends friend. Now I would be okay with just hanging out but then it turned into dating. I told her that they must have been out quite a few times if he thought he could hug her and rub her ass. It took me several dates before I did anything like that. She admitted they have been out alot. I did not ask if they slept together, does not matter. 

She asked about why I went about the way I did on FB. I told her I had seen where things get turned around and the poor guy that got cheated on loses all his friends and the cheater just goes about their life. It was not happening to me. She asked about the pictures I posted, she had not seen some, did not know when I took them. I told her I had a few hundred of her. I take a camera most places. Never know when a good shot will come up. I sell pictures to magazines and other places to make a few bucks here and there. She asked about the vacation we were planning. I told her I am absolutely going. We were going to be near the ocean. The place is already paid. She then asked about the wedding band, if I was going to propose? I told her no but thought that we should maybe start talking more serious about it. They whole time there are tears flowing from both. She then asked if there was anyway to salvage this. I said no. She left shortly afterward. She did ask me to unblock her so she still could follow me. I said in the future but not now. Thanks again for the support.

The thing is however, that I live 40 minutes away from her, and it’s a 30 mile drive. I have sacrificed at this point, so much time and gas money driving to her that I’ve lost track of the numbers. 

Reason being for me driving so much to her house, is because her mom doesn’t believe in her coming to my house. As stupid as it sounds, it’s true. I have come to a compromise at least that whenever she comes over to my house, I have to drive halfway to get her. Do you know how stupid that is? I sacrifice everything to get to her house but her mom hasn’t even been halfway close to my house in my whole 6 months of dating her. And I don’t get any breaks from driving. It’s all one sided. Even if I meet her mom.

This has been obvious to me for a while now. But this I believe is a result of her mom not caring at all for me. Her mom ruins our plans to go hang out, she ruins most of our date plans, and she makes me sacrifice my plans to accommodate for her plans on a whim. If you ask me it’s really selfish, but she doesn’t care. I truly question at times why I sacrifice so much for this girl. But so far my relationship with her has been worth it. 

However, the thing is, I’m leaving for college in a year, and I truly think her mom is trying to drive a wedge between us. Possibly because she has a year more of high school than me and maybe they don’t want her heart broken when I leave. 

My girlfriend tells me all the time that behind my back she tells her I’m not good enough for her, and her mom is for lack of words a rich snob. I don’t have the money her family has but I’m nowhere close to being poor. She’s constantly ruining our plans and every time I’m around her, she’s just a fake bitch. Like it disgusts me to to talk to her because she’s fake to my face, when I know secretly she wishes I was out of her empty and meaningless life, that money bought. 

I just don’t know how long I can put up with it. As Luke Combs says in his country song When it rains it pours: “I don’t have to see my ex future mother in law, anymore” and that seems very appealing to me. 

What should I do in this situation? Is it even worth it to keep fighting for a relationship that seems doomed to end?

[tl;dr] My girlfriends mom is trying to break me up it seems, and I don’t know what to think about it.",relationship_advice
t3_chi5l1,I read my girlfriends journal and it mentioned she was curious about casual sex,"My girlfriend is 9 years younger than me (29 and 20). We have been dating for 1.5 years and its the strongest connection either of us has ever known. 

We both lead adventurous and spontaneous lives. We had just had the most magical, romantic and beautiful six days together on a little island and then she mentions what she wants to do for the winter - go to this one place and learn to surf and build her own surfboard etc. I asked if she wanted me to join and she said she didn’t know. I was a little apprehensive as to why she wouldn’t want me to come but we had talked about this sort of thing in the past. She has never been on her own to do her own thing. She has never been able to live solely for herself, making decisions for herself and not affected by anyone else. She desires to know that she can be on her own and thrive. Shes been in long term relationships for 5 straight years. Has never been on her own as an adult. So I get it, she needs to be free to do her own thing and we always said we’d support each other when that came to be.

So anyway, we have that conversation and i agree she needs to go and do this alone and i totally get it. I might have been a bit sombre looking but i gave her my full blessing. I go to the trailer and sit by myself with my thoughts for a bit and when she comes in she kindly breaks up with me, saying she needs freedom to be herself, alone time to be with her thoughts, try new things and grow and see who she is. I said but we always discussed that we would support each other through that and this is our first opportunity to do that. We haven’t even tried. But anyway that was that. We had a bunch of break up sex and went to bed. I couldn’t sleep so i got up really early and just sat at the coffee table heart broken and pensive. I saw her journal and in a rebellious “fuck this if its over i want to know why” sort of attitude i opened the journal. I probably shouldn’t have because now i can’t stop thinking about it. I didn’t look through it too much but flipped towards the end. One of the last pages had a title “questions about my sexuality” and it mentioned finding other people attractive, not being 100% honest about her sexuality with any of her partners in the past, not ever having casual sex and so on. I should add that our sex life is totally unreal. If i had a dollar for everytime she said, “i think that was the best sex we’ve ever had”

Another title said “questions about my relationship” and mentioned how she has been in long term relationships for so long, wanted to be able to focus on “her tribe”, never felt true pain or rejection and other things. 

Anyway, through all of the breakup conversation we had she had been saying i dont want this to be over. This isn’t over. I love you and want to be with you after this and have your kids. You are my human. She was even crying saying she hopes i dont fall in love with somebody else while shes gone to this place. In my opinion she has all the intentions of staying together, she just really needs her space and freedom like anybody that age, i totally get that. 

But if she was breaking up with me, and her journal said that, i didn’t think i could deal with it to wait for her. So i said when i was leaving, i love you and i understand you have desires and questions that i cant answer, understandably i just dont think i can handle the pain to be your friend during that time. (Totally attempting to sly reference the stuff i read in the journal)

And then i was off. I caught the ferry over and during that time our friend called me first, offering land for lease on a farm, to farm it. I told him the situation and he was bummed. But he called her and told her the same offer. And she was so stoked. She really wants it. She wants to go to this place, learn to surf and build a board and fully commit to coming in the spring to farming this land together. She wants us so bad to do it together, she would even pay rent over the winter while she wasn’t there to secure it. Because she had been thinking a lot about what i said about how we had never even attempted this support while she seeks her alone time and freedom and she agrees we obviously should. 

So we are good now. Back to amazing normal. But i cant get what i read in her journal out my head.

I know i need to fully support her when she needs to go and do her own thing. And she needs to have a chance to be on her own, to be alone and show herself that she can be alone and be independent and be with her thoughts to grow and become her own person. She cant do that if we are always together. And like i said her and i both travel lots and have hobbies that take us away. We are adventurous at heart and dont lead 9-5 lives.

She wants to be together. She said when i told her we couldn’t be friends it felt like i was breaking up with her and it felt like her heart was breaking in to a million pieces and her mind went numb. 

My biggest question is, what do you think? Should i suggest opening the relationship up so she can experience the casual sex she mentioned? It kills me to think about, i dont like it at all. But the more i think about how if she came back after all that then it would be so true and such a bond that it would almost dispel any future insecurities! But it would kill me none the less and i just feel like i would try and hook up with others to make me feel better. But heres why i think i should suggest opening it up, even though i have NOT broached this subject with her yet and i dont actually have any clue how she feels about it. (I’m also EXTREMELY curious how i can bring it up and other subjects from her journal without her know i read it)

I feel like I need to be strong. The risk is so high that i will be so hurt. But she is worth the risk. And she is worth fighting for. And if i had to, that would be how i would fight for her. By being strong. By giving her what she needs. Because every human needs what shes asking for and it was not easy for her to speak her truth. It was courageous, because shes terrified of losing me. I cant see anything else to do. If were to react any differently i would lose her. If i let her go, i may get to keep her. But letting her be free like this is sort of like the ultimate test in ridding possesiveness. Unconditional love means loving my partner and best friend through all of this. Thats kind of where my mind is going. And its getting easier for me to say it, but i am so so terrified of not living up to the reality

TLDR: read my gfs journal it said “...never experienced casual sex.” Would opening our relationship be a logical thing to do and try and preserve our relationship or how to i approach this? I have no desire for casual sex with other people but understand why she would be curious.",relationship_advice

So me and my boyfriend only see eachother like 3 times a week, he works a lot we always see eachother the second we get the chance.

He on the other hand has, when he hangs out with his friend who i can say is pretty much a “delinquent” i don’t like his friend or trust his friend, his friend hangs out w a lot of shady people and all the stories he’s constantly talking about ( which pretty much annoys me) are never good ones. i feel like he’s low key doing that kind of stuff on purpose to get a reaction out of me. i tell him nothing when he goes hang out i don’t tell him i’m sulking or try to made him feel bad or anything. A lot of things only go one way like when it comes to the hanging out thing or when we play around like insults he gets really moody when i play back because he’s “going through some things” i don’t know how to talk to him about this because he is a great guy really, i just feel like he needs a lot of improvement and that he should realize that himself.

t3_chk5kq,Friend breakup after 7 years.,"Me and my friend {both 18F} finally ended things tonight. It’s like a breakup with a long time friend. I thought this girl would always be there. We’ve had lost of good memories, but the friendship had been rocky to say the least. She ignores me, uses me and only come to me with her problems. I’ve known her since we were 11, but I felt obligated to stay friends with her, and I don’t know why. Honestly the friendship should’ve ended years ago. 

She was always upset with me. When I was 15 I fasted a girl for a year and she wouldn’t even talk to me because she thought it was weird I was dating a girl. She didn’t talk to me when I started dating my current boyfriend and she HATED him and didn’t wanna talk to me for months after that. It’s constantly like this. We’ve taken breaks from our friendship countless times. She’s used me too. She only comes back into my life when she has a problem. 

On Friday I wanted to hang out with her and this other girl but they ignored me and sent me snaps of them hanging out without me. Eventually she texted me back but I felt upset and hurt because they ignored me only to send snaps of them together. Tonight I finally confronted her about it and she told me I was being childish and shouldn’t feel bad about being excluded from our friend group. 

Things went down hill quick. She invalidated my feelings right off the bat. I called her out on all the times she’s blown me off for months, told her I was upset about how it seems she only comes back into my life when she needs it. I explained to her that I felt like she didn’t care about our friendship and that I felt like she was too prideful to admit her wrong doings. She basically told me that I was wrong and to have a nice life.

I know I’m a pushover, but I would’ve given her another chance if she’d apologized. It’s been years since we were like good friends, but the friendship was still important. I feel like I made the right decision because she’s toxic to me but I’m also sad and upset that she didn’t even try and fight for our relationship. I just can’t tell if I made a good decision by ending things.",relationship_advice
t3_chk5dq,I [22M) had sex with my best friend [23f] of 5 years. Fearing it will end our friendship,"Some context: We’ve known each other for 6 years and met online. The first time we saw each other irl was 3 years ago. Other than that we’ve met up twice and then again when she visited me in my hometown this Monday through Wednesday. Our friendship as always been very deep and emotional, we’ve talked about pretty much everything on any level and has both had different boyfriend and girlfriends during this period. Our friendship is the type where we can go several months without talking but pick up right where we left without anything being weird. Just to note, we’ve never kissed, held hands or anything. She admitted once that when we first got to know each other she had a minor crush on me but it didn’t last long and that was it. Never have we had any romantic feelings for each other.

To the story: We’ve talked about her visiting me for a long time in my hometown for a few days to chill and go sightseeing here and finally found a time which suited us both which was this Monday. She asked to stay overnight which I said she was more than welcome to. We went out Monday sightseeing and spend the evening watching movies and drinking wine. Came bed time around 1am, we tucked in in my bed and both agreed minutes later we couldn’t sleep. This eventually ended in more wine, then going to the beach to skinny dip at 3 am and going back home to drink more wine. Suddenly (as I remember, we were both really drunk at this point) we started kissing and one thing led to another. We did it and then went to sleep afterwards. The next morning when we woke up at 1pm no one said anything and it was awkward to a degree until i asked to go grap something to eat downtown, which she agreed to. After I said that, it was like nothing ever happened and the awkwardness wasn’t there anymore and we continued to enjoy the day. The rest of Tuesday went by like any other time where we had hung out, laughing joking etc. Came Tuesday evening we watched some more movies, went to bed at 1am, talked until 3am and then just went to sleep. Then Wednesday morning she went home and all was fine. 

Now I’m just sitting with a fear for this to destroy our friendship. We haven’t discussed what happened at all, not even a mention, but things *seem* normal to me. But then again, she had the opportunity to go home Tuesday but stayed a day more just so we could chill. If it really would destroy our friendship, wouldn’t a good sign of this be her going home Tuesday instead of spending another day here? She texted me when she got home and we had a normal chat, nothing out of the ordinary.
I’m feeling conflicted whether to bring the subject up, since I fear it could only lead to something bad. Has anyone experienced the same where the friendship stayed in tact?

TL:DR

Had sex with best friend of 5 years. Awkward in the morning, but otherwise not. She chose to stay a day more than planned. Fearing it will impact our friendship.",relationship_advice
t3_chi2m3,I'd like to be a better partner to someone who is depressed,"I (22F) have just started seeing someone (23M) who has confided in me a bit about his depression. I have just gotten out of a relationship with another person (25M) who was severely depressed. I am wondering what people who aren't depressed do for their depressed partners.

&amp;#x200B;

For background: I myself am not depressed (been to a therapist for plenty of things, but never bad enough to require medication or anything serious). My last boyfriend was INCREDIBLY depressed and was on medication for it . I think he was also bipolar (not diagnosed, but proposed by his doctor). He would have bouts of depression that would result in an immense inability to take care of himself: he wouldn't shower, clean dishes, clean his apartment, throw out old food. Honestly, it was really hard. It was hard to see someone I loved not taking care of themselves. It was hard to be in a home that was so dirty I stopped wanting to sleep there. It was hard to go out to nice dinners with someone who hadn't showered or cleaned his clothes in I don't know how long. It was hard feeling like I couldn't understand what he was feeling. I stayed with him because I loved him a lot and left him for his reasons other than the depression. However, I never felt like I could completely handle/help with/support him in his depression. I simply didn't know what to do, what to look for, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is not a relationship killer for me, but thinking back on my relationship with my ex, I am hesitant to get back into one with a depressed partner if I am not better prepared. Hence, why I am here:

I have recently started seeing another guy and he is *great*. Charming, smart, funny and he's ""wild"" about me. However, he has recently been telling me about his depression. It does not seem anywhere as severe as my last boyfriend's, but I am still hesitant about what to do. I know his depression is not my problem to solve and I will not cure it for him. I would just like to get some advice from others who have been with depressed partners on how they made it work?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I've started seeing someone who is depressed and I would like some advice on being a good partner in this situation as I don't think I was prepared last time.",relationship_advice
t3_chi26y,I (19M) stole my Dad's (60M) whiskey after a physical altercation and I'm not sure if I should feel guilty,"I'm an almost-20-something with a 7 month old child. I moved out of my parent's house the day I turned 18 into a trailer with my now-fiancee.

&amp;#x200B;

On my 18th birthday, during an argument with my dad, he grabbed me by the neck and I pushed him to the ground. I was so scared of how angry I got in that moment, like I would seriously harm him. I don't handle being physically challenged well, I get very pissed off and just start screaming profanity. I kept yelling ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"" and I felt so bad because my mother hates cursing and heard it all.

&amp;#x200B;

At the trailer, I ended up getting my fiancee pregnant and lost my job, so about a year later I had to move me and my fiancee back home with my parents. I tried to avoid arguments as much as possible with my parents but it was inevitable. Couple weeks ago, one of those arguments surfaced between me and my mom. My dad immediately began trying to take control and assert dominance, yelling at both of us to shut up. I said don't tell me to shut up, I'm not a child, yadda yadda. He didn't like that, and got up in my face. He's always had ego problems and loves to try and act macho, like a bully. I actually started laughing and said why are you in my face like this right now? He shoves me as hard as he can out of the room, and right then and there I decided I couldn't live with my parents anymore, or ever again. I said ""that's it, I'm leaving."" And everyone began to cry, they knew the only place I had to go was with my fiancee's parents, 8 hours away in another state. It might seem like I was overreacting, but I knew if I ended up staying that I was probably going to hurt him next time an altercation got physical. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I injured my 60 y/o father.

&amp;#x200B;

I was so pissed because I was reliving my life from a year ago when I moved out the first time. I had/have so much anger towards him for driving me away my whole life, and as I was getting my things I grabbed the bottle of whiskey he had kept in the cabinet. It was foolish, but I wanted to get drunk as a bitch and vent the anger towards my father with some liquor.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out that bottle was my grandfather's whiskey, which he had been keeping since 1974. I didn't care. I never got to meet him. And I rationalized that he deserved it. I never have ever retaliated against my dad my entire life, except for when I pushed him off of me and this bottle of whiskey. My whole life he has called me a pussy, a dumbass, everything under the sun. He barely taught me anything, was basically just an example of how not to treat a woman and how not to treat people in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it was wrong to steal, stealing is always wrong and two wrongs don't make a right. But I feel as though I do not owe him an apology. I drank that fucking whiskey and it was delicious. He has never apologized to me for bullying me a day in his life.

&amp;#x200B;

I know he'll likely never apologize or come to me first, so our relationship will likely be severed if I don't try to be the bigger person. He hasn't talked to his other son (my half brother) for 2 years because of his personality, and I feel like that's an indication of how our relationship will end up.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to never talk to my Dad again, but I'm tired of just pretending everything is normal every time he acts like this. He treats my mother like shit still and it's getting to the point where I resent him so heavily I don't even want to see him.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone help me navigate what I did, and how to move forward with a father like mine.

t3_chi1qb,I [23F] feel like I’m maybe the crazy one!,"I feel weird posting on reddit about this, but I don’t have any friends I trust to talk about this with so anonymous strangers will have to do! 

I’ve been with my husband [23M] for 3 years. 1 married. We were friends years before that. 

I’ve been unhappy for years for one reason or another. I’ve suffered from depression, though I consider myself having high functioning depression (I work full time successfully, keep my house decent, etc). Whenever I moved in with my husband three years ago, my life got so much worse...I noticed about a year in that he had much higher expectations for me than he had for himself. Aka, he expects me to do the housework, cook dinner, and is constantly being bossy (asking me to get things for him, etc). I shrugged these feelings off because I’ve not wanted to let my ego get in the way of our relationship. However, if I ever bring up issues I have with this, or frankly anything in our relationship, it ends in him raising his voice and me shutting down. My mind goes blank when I’m yelled at, essentially. We split bills, but he’s constantly throwing in my face how he makes slightly more than me, and uses that as an excuse to sit around and relax when he’s not at work. He also doesn’t like me to hug or kiss him, and only kisses me if I’m still asleep when he leaves for his job in the morning. He asks for sex very bluntly, and I never feel in the mood because I feel very frustrated constantly around him. I get no pleasure from sex, and he makes it very clear he believes it’s entirely my fault for not making an effort during sex. It’s clear to me, though, he doesn’t want to be intimate. He just wants get his rocks off. 

If I try to bring up an action that bothered me, or we get on a topic we disagree on, he eventually says ‘I just don’t care,’ and exits the conversation. He literally ignores what I say on the topic any further. When we argue, he makes me feel like I’m the crazy one who is being insanely unreasonable, when all I want is for him to pour his own glass of tea.

I know this all sounds petty, I’m sure, but at this point I’m not sure I can stand another 50 years of this. My family is very religious, and I believe in sticking it out, but I’m not here to be emotionally abused every day. It’s gotten to the point to where I’ve stopped trying to make conversation with him so I can avoid conflict. I know that contributes to the issue, but I don’t know what else to do. 

Also he’s refused counseling citing a ‘bad counseling experience’ from when he was a child.

How do you shut that off? I guess it’s a time thing. I just don’t know how to prioritize myself...",relationship_advice
t3_chk2z5,Boyfriend’s lack of affection is really getting to me. Does this sound like he’s just with me out of convenience and doesn’t even want to be with me?,"I was trying to give this relationship some time. I found out he grew up in a somewhat abusive household where his parents were not very loving and affection was never shown to him. I thought as our relationship progressed, he would be able to express it more

We will be together a year in September. Both have children, about an hour distance from each other so in the beginning, it went very slow due to the time restraints, distance, work schedule, custodial schedule, etc. and saw each other once a week. The VERBAL affection, and I capitalize that because that’s something I’m not getting, and is important to me, was present. Maybe the first month, three stopped, then I got a little bit of it in month 3. And it wasn’t a lot to begin with. I would get a text here and there with a sweet emoji, a “good morning beautiful”, “good night, sweet dreams”, “I can’t wait to see you”... just a sweet text that didn’t take a whole lot of effort but meant so much. Nowadays, I get NOTHING. Absolutely fucking nothing, unless I say something first then he reciprocates.

Here are the positives though- and they’re pretty big. We spend 2-3 overnight visits together, the kids have all been introduced recently so we get to spend that time together. He’s met my parents and other family members (I haven’t met his parents because he doesn’t get along with them). But besides his kids, I've met his grandparents. He also seems to be putting a lot more effort in terms of spending whatever free time he has, with me. Which is big because he’s a workaholic and works long hours. And also very important- when we are together alone, he’s very affectionate. Still not verbally, he could very well be a robot. But physically. He holds me, kisses me, rubs my back, just makes me feel desired at least. We don’t go out often because we are homebodies, but when we do, he just doesn’t go out of his way to even hold me hand.

I’ve talked to him, yes it may have been a while ago, but I don’t want to bring it up again because I don’t want to seem like a nag. I’ve brought up that I wish I would hear from him more because that was a major issue for me. And he’s made the effort the past couple months. I just don’t want to come out and say “hey I’d love if you would say sweet things to me” it just sounds silly.

I thought maybe it was just his upbringing and have been willing to overlook that and deal with it because he is truly a wonderful guy otherwise. But nope. He’s certainly capable because he calls his daughter “baby” all the time, holds her hand just when they’re sitting watching her iPad, comes up to her and just holds her. Now I want to be straight that I don’t expect that level to be the same with me because I have kids too and show so much love towards them. But I’m only using that as an example to state that the guy isn’t incapable. He is, but he just never ever calls me baby. He calls me by my first name. He never goes for my hand to hold it. When we’re standing around, he doesn’t just come up to me to hold me by my waist. It’s just my last boyfriends have had no problem doing it, yet he does so it makes me wonder if he even desires me. 

Like I said, when we’re sitting on the couch or laying in bed watching TV, he’ll put his arm around me, hold me, kiss me, motion to have me lay my head on my chest but he fucking sucks otherwise. He can’t even call me babe, and it’s so natural for me that I just call him that while he calls me by my first name that it sounds so much like a friend or a business associate.

Does this sound like a guy who might just be with me out of convenience and really doesn’t care or want to be in a relationship?

TLDR
Boyfriend of almost a year doesn’t show any affection unless we are alone, and even that has limitations. And absolutely zero verbal affection. He’s not incapable of showing love because I see how he is with his daughter. Is he just with me out of convenience?",relationship_advice

t3_chjz4c,I [19M] have problems with my GF [20F] because of trust and thinks I'm a mediocre,"Hi everyone, I write this post because of the recent difficulties with my GF. So, here comes a story...

&amp;#x200B;

I started having trust issues when she blocked me from all social media somewhat 2 years ago, she told me she deleted her accounts, but I discovered her (but didn't confront her because I supposed she blocked me for a real? good reason).

Sometime later, she told me the ""truth"" while drunk (she excused that she wanted to maintain our relationship out of the eyes of some dudes that were being mean with us), I made it like nothing and went on the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, later on, about a year and a half ago she went on to a course to pass the exam to enter into college, in that course she met a girl (GF is bi), whose she started to talk. I was pretty happy she made a good friend. Some time passed and we were hanging at school, and she told me she was going to eat with this girl. I was pretty sick that day but told her that was cool. She started to behave abnormal, as she went there she didn't answer any message (as we always told each other that we arrived well, bc we're in a tough city). Later when she arrived home, I asked her how it went, and she told me that it was okay and she'd like to see her again. Randomly, one day she was giving a personal class in the library, and I was working into installing something into his computer, she had Whatsapp Web connected, so all messages were notified in the computer, then she started receiving some weird messages from that friend, I opened the convo and saw a newly started chat, so I went onto searching the name of the girl in her messages and found about how she ALMOST kissed the girl, how much she liked her, how much she made her excited, her friend replied that if she was going to dump me, to what she said she didn't knew.

Obviously, I was pretty furious and confronted her when she came back from leaving his pupil. She told me how sorry she was, she excused saying that she was confused because I was the only man she had dated in years and that she knew her friend didn't like women, so she was sure that if she pressured her, she wouldn't have had kiss her.

I accepted her apology and went on with our relationship with the condition to not to talk to this girl again, she to make me feel ""secure"" gave me all her passwords of social media accounts and accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime later, in a panic attack (I wasn't in therapy at the moment and didn't make to control my emotions) I entered her Snapchat account, to find that when we had about 8 months together she was sending nudes to some two dudes of a music school she was going. The same scene, confronted her, she told me she didn't do that, that probably the guys got into her cellphone and send to themselves the pics, it was a good explanation but I saw that she sent it at about 11PM, so no way those dudes could get on to her phone. Even though I didn't take any screenshot and I have a pretty bad memory, so she told me that was not true. So, apologized and we solve this by agreeing that she would not talk to them again.

&amp;#x200B;

Time later, we entered the same college, so we were pretty happy, only thing is that my classes were at the morning and she's on the evening, that didn't make any problem as she came earlier to the uni and I left a little bit late. Problem comes when a guy she met in her classes starts approaching more and more, she felt somewhat vulnerable and that guy (her words) make her feel protected, so one day she starts making poems, sharing posts about love on FB and that's where I knew something was wrong. 

 Time later, she tells me she ""likes"" this guy, but she wants me to try harder with her because she didn't want to break up with me. Days and some discussions later, she asks me for a break for thinking about 'us', the day later I see her with the guy in her car, so I confront her over the phone. We kinda broke up. She kept looking after me saying that I was making up things and I was in extreme jealous (in fact I was, thank god therapy for helping me with jealousy) and all were in my mind, buuuut meanwhile in her IG she was uploading stories about how much she liked him and bla bla.

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty freaking sad about this, so I went onto talking to some girls who were my friends and talked about the situation, how I felt and all that. I made a huge mistake here because I told one girl (I never told her because I wanted to affect my GF, I didn't even think that it could affect) who has always hated my GF that she had a mental illness.

&amp;#x200B;

My GF and I started talking things out, went back onto our relationship and went pretty happy until she discovers what I had told to this girl. She lost all the trust in me and all things. But things start to work out again. (and I went to therapy)

&amp;#x200B;

One day she tells me that she misses this guy as a friend, and I give the benefit of the doubt and let her talk to him, but I just couldn't stand that, so I went on some kind of breakdown and ask her again to stop talking (it was a tough process for me). Things like this some months until the semester ends. I tried getting into an agreement about talking to this guy, but it was so difficult to me, at last, because I wanted to consider her feeling I accepted, but with the condition of not going into his house (he lives alone) and trying to maintain her space with him. Sadly, the first day of the new semester, she entered all classes with him, (Oh, and remember the girl of the first story? she also entered a class with her) and went on his house to see him and some friends...  I went on a breakdown and told her that that make me feel bad. Although I asked her to not change all her classes, but keeping the space clausule, she declined and changed all her classes. Later on she hated her semester and starting telling me everyday that, making me feel guilty and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

She now has a work as a teacher, and I'm studying for getting in the programming industry but I don't have the same experience as her (I don't have any experience actually, I just started programming at the start of the year, but been constant) so she starts telling me to get a job so we can go living together, to what I answer her positively. I been looking for a job like 2 months and don't find anything (not that is a surprise to me, I just don't have that much projects under my belt) to what she says that I must nos be doing anything to pursue our goals and that I'm a mediocre and she doesn't want mediocres in her life and all that. And remarks that she has no friend and that I'm isolating her because of how I asked her to stop talking to this people.

&amp;#x200B;

So, that's practically a TL;DR of what has been this hahaha, I would like some opinions, this can be saved? if not, how can I get out? I'm just going crazy and I'm the worst BF of the world? I  know I have made my errors, but when we discuss, only my errors are visible, but her's are somewhat my fault because of her isolation.",relationship_advice

t3_chhtmd,Best friends with my ex who I’m still in love with.,"It’s been almost two months since my ex broke up with me. We were very long distance and I had major family and money issues that meant we had no idea when we’d see each other again.
We broke up, but we still talk everyday. He became my best friend, and I still feel so torn about it. I’m still in love with him and don’t really know how to get over that. Plus I’m pretty sure he’s still in love with me. 
I asked if he’d ever wait for me, and said he’d be open to try again only if we lived in the same country. 
I was and am still trying to get work there to move, i have wanted to even before I met him, but I feel like I’m banking on getting back together once I do. 

I know I shouldn’t expect anything and there’s a possibility of him meeting someone before I move, but I can’t help thinking there’s still a chance. Maybe because this was my first relationship. 

Idk, I guess I still feel shitty about it all but still glad we’re friends.",relationship_advice
t3_chjy8s,I lost my virginity to a guy on Tinder and I feel bad because of it,"I recently broke up with my long distance relationship online because he was always so busy and we didn’t spend enough time together. After break up, I started to feel lonely and I started to miss him. I honestly felt regretful of breaking up with him. He was on vacation and we barely spoke on the phone because he was busy. I felt like I could’ve waited til he got off of vacation and we can talk a lil bit more.

Two days ago I went on tinder hoping I could find someone close. I didn’t want to feel lonely so I talked to a couple of guys to see who I felt I could be interested in. None on tinder worked so I downloaded another dating app . I liked a guy and he did too. We exchanged some words and he wanted to videocall. We video called and talked about life. We also texted to know more about each other. We decided we could meet later that day. Later on he texted me asking for a full body picture I told him that I was bbw and to see if he would be interested. I didnt send it because we were talking about two things at once and I also didnt want to send it. I told him no that he will see me tomorrow. I honestly dont like sending full body pictures since I am not comfortable with myself and I never done that before.  He told me Im acting like he never seen tits or ass before then he sent me a picture of his dick. I ended up sending him me a picture of my body clothed.  We then exchanged snaps and instagram.  I knew his intention was to have sex because he said “tomorrow we will have fun.” I then told him I was a virgin . We both then talked about sex and what I should bring tomorrow.  I ended up sending him a nude .  He tells me we should have sex while I am playing on his ps4. I was up for it I never knew how that’ll be. Later onto the conversation,  he told me he wanted me to be his gf he said that he is sure I can be faithful to not cheat even though I am going away to college. That we could see each other when I am on breaks. I told him I am not committed to a relationship then he told me “so u feel if we date you gonna cheat on me” I told him to calm down and he asked me “you dont want one because of distance” I told him yes and for me to focus on school and we can be friends. He tells me okay and continues on having sex.  We both talked more about sex and he asked me “you sure you dont wanna date I hate just fucking any random chicks” I told him we shouldnt do it and he said he wants to date me. I went on that we should know each other.  And he told me “no we fucking and we gonna date lol because we just alike so why not” I told him to not force it . He tells me whats the point of going on a dating app if im going to be fucking random dude and taking a girls virginity means a lot to them. He said he wants to be there for me and take me on a date and places. I was telling him about how far my college would be and he tells me he dated someone in another state for five years and it worked out for them.  I tell him I just had a recent break up because of distance but we can date . 


We are in the same state and lives 40 minutes away so it wasnt hard meeting . In the morning he picked me up and took me to his house. We talked about the games he played. We ended up having sex a couple of times in a short period of time. Honestly it was my first time and after we finished , I didnt felt connected to him . He was a small dude and I started to think I moved too quickly with him. I didnt feel any bond with him and felt like he could be a friend to me not my boyfriend. Later on we went to get some food and I saw some kids passing by and we were talking about children. He told me that he wanted to have children in his 20s. That kinda threw me off because hes already 25 and I plan to go to medical school when I am done with college. Plus I feel like that wouldnt work out then. I kinda felt a bit thrown off during sex as well. He didnt smelt so great and havent went to college yet. I already knew he didnt because we talked on the phone and he said he wants to go back. But like I said I felt no bond.


I told my close online friend that I lost my virginity. I went to sleep and woke up feeling bad. I checked my temperature it was 99.2. My period was late by a week before having sex . I also told my friend I am sick. He called me and I told him that I lost my virginity from a guy on the dating app. He calls me a hoe/thot and tells me that I should not tell anyone because they will think I am a hoe. I started to think more about it and honestly regret meeting up with this guy and losing my virginity. I’m not trying to say it was a good thing but I ended up learning what I thought I like about sex..i ended up not liking some things that I thought I would enjoy. I felt a bit bad what my friend said to me but I felt it was also true. I told him I want to break up with this dude and I am nervous he tells me to do that and to wait a week to get checked out.


I messaged the guy “I honestly don’t know about a relationship I do feel bad about losing my v that fast and that I moved quick. I also feel less compatible . We do have some things in common but I don’t feel a deep connection relationship wise. “ He tells me ok I tell him how he feels about it. He told me that we shouldn’t talk and that I wasted his time and we should’ve never had sex. I told him I fucked up and that I was sorry. He tells me he was tired of being used. I told him i thought itll work out. He tells me whatever and he will stay single for a year now.  


I really know I fucked up but I don’t know how to move on about this.

Edit: Unnecessary question but I really dont know what to say if a guy ask if I am a virgin. I know I am not a virgin anymore but I dont know of itll be a good idea to tell any future relationship that I lost mine from a tinder date.

Edit: Thank you guys for the support I feel much better now Im focused on going to the doctor to get checked out next week :)",relationship_advice
t3_chfc8m,She cheated on me again and left me twice for another man.,"Hello, I’m (M19) and she’s (F17) I posted this on another sub Reddit with better detail and a full story but I don’t wanna bore anyone with a long drown out story about what happened let me know if I should tell what happened again and I’ll edit this post and tell the story. 

I’ll get to the point, I took her back, she made promises she couldn’t keep. She lied to me and left me for another guy. She eventually grew to realizes she was the bad person and she couldn’t handle it. I argued and bickered with her constantly telling her she hangs with him everyday and it hurts me. It got to the point where I was screaming and very upset, she promised me she would talk to me later tonight and I can ask anything I want. Surprise surprise, she she didn’t follow up on her promise. I texted her telling her this is bullshit and she hurts me again and again. How she is unfair and how stupid and selfish she’s being after I was with her for over 4 years and she keeps doing this. I told her how much she’s hurting me and how this is absolutely ridiculous. She then goes on to tell me “I’m sorry. I can’t do this” then completely left out of my life. I tried contacting her multiple times, she blocked me, she I in-added me and my friends on snap. And I haven’t heard from her since July 4th. 

I’m upset because she constantly told me she loves me, she would yell and scream at me for even another girl to even look at me but she would be with another man. I tell her how much she’s hurting me and how it’s some bullshit and she would say and I quote “I can’t, I can’t, I don’t wanna be the bad guy anymore. I CANT TAKE HURTING YOU ANYMORE” but when this guy needs help she invites him over and loves him. I can DM her on Instagram and try and talk. I feel really lonely and awful and I want closure. What should I do?

We were super close before and talked all day everyday for about a year until we both went to different colleges.

I don’t know what is expected out of me in the relationship besides what the movies tell you and that isn’t the best guide in real life.
Essentially my question is what is expected of you as a boyfriend in most relationships, plus what should I do regarding her boyfriend? She is constantly complaining to me and her other friends about how shitty he is but I don’t want to come across as desperate telling her to end it with him.

t3_chhs1c,If you have cheated on your partner please help me understand this..,"I M,32 am 24/7 accused by my GF of 3 years, F 32, of cheating.. But I've never cheated on her and always loved her wholeheartedly.

Without getting into details, I need to understand how other humans think. because being in this relationship, made me question my own reality and the way I perceived the universe.

So my question is for those who cheated on their partners before..

If you did cheat on your partner, it means you found someone that you liked, someone that you enjoyed, and clearly you must have enjoyed them more than your partner that you cheated on them, if this is the case, and you did cheat, then why did you stay with your partner ? OR YOU DIDN'T?

You see.. My argument with my partner is this.. If I like Pizza, and I chose to eat pizza, and I am trying to get pizza, and I am accused of cheating (aka. liking Burgers), then why am I insisting that I like Pizza? (instead of going and enjoying my burger that I allegedly like more than pizza?)

So basically, if you cheated on your partner, meaning you found out that you like burgers, then why did you went back and eat pizza after you found out you like burgers more!? Or you didn't!? My feeling is that humans don't find out that they like burger, but insist on eating pizza. My feeling is that if a human find out they like burger, they go get burger, they won't sit there beg the pizza. Why would they? They like burgers!!!!!

Can someone help me understand what is going on in my partners head?! When she accuses me of cheating and liking someone else, when I am not with someone else but with her, and I have no intention or motive to go with someone else, how does she rationalize this in her head, that I like someone else?!

tl:dr; Help me understand, when you cheated on your partner, meaning you found someone that you liked so much that you had to cheat on your partner with, then did you go back with your partner?!?!?!?!? IF yes, why? It makes no sensE !",relationship_advice
t3_chedf6,My bf's (30) new bff at work is a hot 21 year old girl,"My bf and I (30&amp;28), together for three years, have moved to a new country together. I have trouble getting to know people because I work basically alone. He started in a company together with an attractive young woman (21). She’s in a relationship, too, but her partner is working overseas for foreseeable future. 

Even though they are part of a 9-headed team in a bigger 60-headed department, all I hear is her name all day long. She’s the only one he added on social media, she’s the one he sits with all the time (office doesn’t have regular desks, employees are encouraged to change seats every day, yet wherever they sit, they sit together).

After worrying about it for a while, I sort of self-invited myself when I heard she was very insistent of taking him out to some event with some coworkers+friends. They didn’t sit next to each other, but all night they pulled faces at each other, winked at each other and almost fell into everyone’s drinks while leaning over the whole table to talk to another. I was completely blocked off from his side, was barely able to talk to him and left to chat to two other people (who were admittedly really fun, so the evening wasn’t horrible, but I hoped meeting her would give me some peace of mind and unfortunately it didn’t).

My bf is a very social guy and has a wide friend group. He got along with everyone that night very well, so I don’t understand why it’s her her her 24 hours a day. I honestly feel like in high school again where you have this sort of drama. Anyway, right after we got home after that event, I see he’s texting her immediately and the morning after, too.

I’m so overwhelmed by all of this that I didn’t say goodbye when we parted ways this morning. He asked me what’s up via text and I told him I can’t deal with him, a 30 year old man, having this fixation, this giggly, face pulling, all night texting friendship with a 21 year old person that he sits next to out of choice ALL DAY. I can’t take it. I know this is super controlling, it’s more than I can take. He says I’m insane and he can’t deal with this. I can’t either.

Is this worth breaking up over? I do love him dearly and our lives are so merged (visa, car, apartment) because we’re in this country together, I don’t know how we even could break up. I’m at work and can’t focus on anything else right now. I can’t believe I’m in this situation. I feel so jealous and I hate it. Is this normal? Am I completely overreacting? Honestly, if I’m really wrong, please don’t lash out at me and please kindly make me understand because I love this man a lot and I don’t want to lose him over some insanity of mine. I want to cry right now. If I’m right, how do I go about this? Please, I would really appreciate some help.

We both struggle with mental health issues (she has a case of depression and anxiety that she's more-or-less but imperfectly controlled with medication during the entire time we've been together; I started developing a case of depression over the past few years which I've successfully treated with medication over the past six months or so), but we've been able to support each other through those problems as well.  Last summer, after five years of couplehood and several years living together, we decided that we wanted to make sure we would be together long-term no matter what the post-PhD job market threw at us and got married.

&amp;#x200B;

The next year was hard on both of us.  I basically wiped out on the academic job market-- nobody even wanted to interview me-- and the depression I had been wrestling with for the past few years got dramatically worse.  She did a little better (got an interview request from a very prestigious college) but also ultimately walked away empty-handed.  I hit rock-bottom in the winter, and started taking medication, which made me a lot more capable.  My workload at the time was somewhat lighter than hers, so I started the process of looking for jobs outside of academia earlier.  With some help from my math degree, some carefully-calibrated self-presentation, and a few connections I had made doing academic competitions in high school and college, I managed to get an amazing entry-level job at an alternative investment firm in NYC that came with a very good starting salary and great benefits for both of us.  

&amp;#x200B;

She had lived in NYC before and loved it, and was excited to move back there and have more opportunities to enjoy opera, theater, and the arts.  At first, she was just really happy that I had gotten the job and ensured that we would have financial stability and health insurance and get to live in a good place together.  Some problems started to emerge after she finished teaching her last class of the semester and started looking for and applying for non-academic jobs in New York (mostly in publishing, journalism, and nonprofit administration).  So far, she has struck out, and she suspended her search while we prepared for our big move (which is still ongoing right now).  She and I both know intellectually that these sort of career transitions often take a lot of time and effort, but she finds it hard to avoid comparing herself to me and feeling upset that she's struggling to find a job even though I found a prestigious and well-paying position relatively quickly.  This is sort of a reversal for the two of us-- she got admitted to a bunch of prestigious PhD programs, was the star of her department, and received a big bonus to her stipend.  I only got into one program and heard from my adviser that I was considered a high-risk but potentially high-reward recruit whose performance would be uncertain.  Throughout most of our relationship, she has out-earned me and racked up more awards and publications than I have, so the reversal stings.

&amp;#x200B;

Another family of concerns sprung up when she realized that I had plenty of friends (or rather, a few friends and a fairly extensive group of friendly acquaintances) in the city but most of her connections had moved away.  In general, I tend to be more gregarious and have wider (and more geographically dispersed) networks of less close friends while she has smaller, tighter collections of close friends, a tendency which exacerbates the situation.  Understandably, she's also concerned about isolation.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, she feels really anxious about both the job hunt and the process of making new friends, and sometimes she gets really overwhelmed and sort of blue-screens.  As a result, I've been handling most of the more executive function-intensive/socially demanding parts of the move like finding us a place to live, negotiating with real estate brokers, finding and communicating with the moving company, planning our itinerary and finding accommodations along the way, etc as well as half of the packing/cleaning/throwing stuff away which comes with moving.  Once we get to New York, I'm going to make a lot of effort to introduce her to my friends and make sure that she has a social circle.  And I've also been telling her that I believe in her capability to do great things, that I recognize that the process of changing careers is really difficult and time-consuming, and that I'll be happy to financially support both of us for as long as the process takes.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of these steps have helped, but my wife is still struggling a lot.  She worries that I or my family will start to see her as a deadbeat if she can't find a position soon, feels overwhelmed and anxious if I have a conversation about finance with anyone in front of her (she's thrifty and sensible, but doesn't have much knowledge about or interest in pretty much anything to do with economics), and also sometimes expresses a fear that she's not attractive enough for me (over the past few years, I've gotten a fair amount more muscular and traditionally handsome, but she's always been a beautiful woman with an amazing body; I tell her that multiple times a day and have sex with her every other day or more).  

&amp;#x200B;

I want her to be able to see herself the way I see her, believe in herself, and feel comfortable and secure.  What additional steps would all of you recommend that I take to emotionally support her through this understandably difficult time?",relationship_advice
t3_chjwbg,I (22f) don't know how to tell my fiancé (23 m) that I'm on a diet,"Sorry if this sounds dumb or something but I've been stressing over it.

Before I met my fiancé I had an eating disorder, no money, and terrible self esteem. I dropped nearly half my weight because of it. After getting help, a better paying job, and moving countries, I was able to be in the best physical shape I've ever been in. I got myself to a healthy, manageable weight, and then I met my fiancé.

Our relationship definitely made me put on some pounds. I'm a vegetarian and I usually eat pretty clean but he's really into fast food and I guess I got swept into it. After some not-so-nice (not-so-subtle) comments from my siblings, my mother, and even the wedding dress consultant, I decided I'd go on a diet.

My fiancé and I have never had secrets from each other, which is why it's killing me that he has no idea that I've been dieting for a week now. I'll usually pack my own lunches and eat breakfast at work so it makes sense that he hasn't noticed. It feels so sneaky and honestly really dumb now that I'm typing it out.

I don't want him to think that I'm relapsing. He's a sweet guy so I know he'll panic as soon as I say ""diet""  and I know he'll panic even harder once I tell him it's been going on for a week. I just don't know how to even start talking to him about it.

**tl;dr** my fiancé doesn't know i'm on a diet for the first time since recovering from eating disorder and idk how to tell him without him freaking out

Update: So I explained that I wanted to be healthier. He understood &amp; felt bad a little because he thinks our relationship is partially to blame for my weight gain (we eat out a lot). He was a little concerned about relapse but he basically said that it's been a while and he trusts me to know what to do with my body. Thanks for the advice!",relationship_advice

t3_chf9bl,I [18M] will be going to university far from home. My gf [18F] wants to come to the same uni but I know she won't be following her desired career path.,"I have been reading this reddit for the past year and I've taken a lot from it. However, I have never come across a post with something along the lines of my predicament...  


My gf and I have been together for just short of a year now. Early in the relationship, I expressed my interest in a university that would require me to move away from home. She liked my plans but it seems she never has really put some thought into it. Now, I'm making headway, applying for scholarships, halls of residence etc... but she has now changed her plans to go to the same uni as I. Don't get me wrong, I'd love it if she came with me, but the university doesn't fully offer the courses she was looking to attend here at home. I don't want to tell her that she shouldn't come (as to not give her the wrong idea). Also, I established early on in the relationship that I would be going to my university of choice and that our relationship would not be a factor in my decision.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I have, is that I know she is changing her choice of tertiary education, just to stay with me. What do I tell her without making it appear I don't love her? I don't want her to waste several years and a considerable amount of cash to get a degree that she wasn't looking to get...

t3_chnu1f,My girlfriend has completely stopped having sex with me; claims her birth control has 100% killed her libido. I think she’s lying?,"We had sex almost every day at the beginning of our relationship and it was great. She got on BC pills a few months ago, and ever since, she just doesn’t want to have sex ever and it’s really starting to bug me. 

She claims that low libido is a normal effect of all birth control, but I know from past relationships that this isn’t true. Is she just making excuses because the sex is bad? Whenever we do I tend to finish quickly...mainly because I’m so excited that it’s actually happening, since it’s such a rare occurrence now.

t3_chjubv,My (20M) girlfriend (21F) doesn't understand that I need alone time,"So ive been with my girlfriend for a year and a few months now, and lately ive been having trouble getting alone time. Shes been essentially living with me for the past couple months due to the shitty management at her apartment screwing her over. In fact, shes going to be living with me for a few weeks to bridge the gap between her leases. All this time together has made it very difficult for me to recharge and ive tried explaining this to her. She basically gave me a guilt trip about how she could go walk around the mall for a few hours until im ready for her to come home. This was a couple weeks ago, and she still has never done this or anything else to give me space. In her defense, she has stopped asking me to pick her up from work, which gives me a couple hours a day to myself, since she has to take the bus.

Ive tried going on walks and running errands on my own and i do find that does help, but it still isnt enough. Even if were doing our own things just having her there in my apartment is draining me. Ive been feeling increasingly stressed and depressed as a result of this. Shes gone back to her apartment wednesday to thursday and wants me to pick her up on friday. I asked her if i can get her on saturday instead, and she didnt agree, but she didnt deny either. All day today (wednesday) shes been messaging me. Ive been slow to respond and it seems shes getting upset.

I dont know what more i can do to make her understand that i need space. She acknowledges that i need alone time, yet doesnt seem to do anything about it. Ive been very distant towards her for weeks, but just being with her is so mentally taxing right now. Am i in the wrong? What do i have to say to make it clear to her that i need her to leave me alone?",relationship_advice
t3_chjtnm,"I (M, late 20's) need help with Family relations, having not known them most of my life.","Greetings all, to preface I'd like to prioritize anonymity as much as I can. I would like any advice on making sense of my current family relations, both extended and immediate if possible. I'm new to this and I know they use this Reddit platform so I'll try to be as concise as possible. I feel a fair bit of back story is necessary, so, I'll just get to it then. My family has always been your typical dysfunctional type. We love each other, however we never express this. Things have been seesawing in the past several years, as we have been working together, struggling to survive month to month, just barely, for years and years (to this day we still have major debt). A little over 2 years ago, my Sibling passed away tragically and it has devastated all of us ...Life has and never will be the same without them.

Sadly, I feel this has caused many questions and problems to rise to the surface. Would we have continued to drift apart until we could all support ourselves independently had they not passed away? probably, yes.. Would my extended family be reaching out to us the way they are now? who knows.. However, It would be nice to try getting to know them, something I might've done once I had made something out of myself or regretted enough one day. Yet, I feel this is all forced now because my sibling passed away and well.. I don't really know. This whole dynamic feels really wrong and fucked to me. My head is on the verge of exploding just thinking about everything for the better part of the past few years, add on the fact that I still have a massive road ahead of me in terms of simply starting my life at some point (no studdies, next to zero work experience besides helping  with family, never been in a relationship and so on), It's fucking depressing...

I think I can speak to my immediate family and work things out (open to any opinions though), but my issue is the extended family, I have never seen nor contacted them.. Not since we were kids and had family gatherings. I have never used Facebook or had any 'real friends'. I have zero idea what I should say, where the fuck do I begin? I realize what an anti-social POS that I've been my entire life, the person I was closest to, confided in with all my deepest secrets that I have told nobody else, turned to when I needed advice - ultimately depended on when I needed a direction in life.. has been ripped away from me. I have never felt so alone. I never kept any close friends or maintained that close a relationship with my other siblings. No matter how bad I'd like to end it all and join my sibling, I could never put my family through that shit again (not suicidal).

So here I am, looking for any advice on how to mend my family relations - I appreciate any advice or response what so ever.. I am happy to answer any questions to a degree if needed.

\*Just an FYI; I went through a great deal when I was very young - it made me the strong person I believe I am today, I know the goals I want to achieve and life I want to lead etc. I feel I can take pretty much anything life throws my way at this point except for this ironically enough, I'm just trying to figure things out with my family due to my social ineptitude. Also yes, I will get therapy some day when I can afford it (haven't made a cent in years).",relationship_advice
t3_chcsa8,Me (26F) and my boyfriend (36M) need Long Distance Relationship Advice. Long.,"So I have a LD BF. I will refer to him as ""N"". I live in Seattle WA. He lives in Phoenix AZ. We are trying to close the distance gap but we(he) are(is) having some trepidation on how to do this. Advice is welcome. 

Ill start with this. I LOVE ""N"". He is the best man I have ever had as a partner, with out doubt. So breaking up is really not an option. For me, ""N"" is the one. He is the full package, a ""catch"", if you will. I've never felt more listened too, loved, and appreciated. He is my friend, hardworking, intelligent, and handsome af. Truly, I couldn't ask for more. The only down side is that he lives in Phx.

 I grew up in Phx but 3 years ago moved to Seattle WA. Ive been very happy and successful in making a life here. Im in college full time, I have a solid group of friends, a good job, a great apartment with a reasonable-ish rent, and I love the weather(hate the heat). I very much planned on living the remainder of my life in PNW. Obviously the universe doesn't give a shit about my plans and Christmas of 2018  ""N"" and I started talking and have now been dating each other exclusively since April 2019. 

In May, ""N"" asked me if I would be willing to move back down to Phx and close the gap between us. As soon as he said it I knew that of course I wanted to be in Phx with him. It made me very happy and I had very much been looking forward to the end of my lease. I assumed that when he asked me to move back to Phx, he intended on me moving into his home. However, earlier this month, while down in Phx, my little brother, who  works with ""N"" and is his very good friend, informed me that ""N"" didn't plan on me living with him. I was confused/shocked to say the least .  Admittedly he never outright asked me to move into his home, however he had never corrected me when I made numerous comments the previous few months re: living us together and decorating his home. 

This weekend I was in Phx again and we started discussing me possibly moving to AZ. He informed me he was worried about me living with him and would prefer I move to AZ but live in my own apartment within a 3 minute drive from his home. No lie, it really hurt to hear him say it. But Im a logical person. I completely understand ""N""s reasoning. He is very worried about the transition of us going from weekend visits and a few hours of daily FaceTime talks to living together and being with each other 24/7. He is fearful we will quickly grow annoyed or resentful of each other.  I completely get that. It makes sense. But I disagree with it. I feel he is asking me to take a very large risk/change on my part, do all of the work, and get no guarantee of our relationship continuing.  I feel he should  be open to the risk/change of us living together and be willing to move forward as a couple in this way. I am very adamant that I will not move 1350 miles across the country unless I am going to be living with him in the same home. Thankfully, he being the amazing man he is, also understands where Im coming from. He is willing to compromise and so am I, but I honestly do not know what to do. I dont know how to compromise on this.

So my questions is, what the heck do we do? Is there a compromise to this? And if so, what is it? Please help. 

Side notes that may help: He has never been married or engaged or lived with another woman before but has had 2 serious girlfriends in the past. I have been married and was divorced by 20. We have know each other for about a decade. Our families have been friends for years.  My late father was his work mentor and friend. He  now works with and is basically best friends/older brother figure to my little brother who I am also very close with. We have a  foundation of friendship and trust already built.

t3_chjsmy,"Ungrateful mom, free car, and my sanity","Tl;Dr- Mom won't take my car I'm giving to her for free but still expects rides on her demand. Told her I'm am not going to do it any longer and now she's pissed at me. How do I keep the peace?

I am 29 years old female with no kids and just graduated college (first in my family). I moved back in with my mom 4 years ago to go back to school and to save up $$ for a house. I will now be starting a job where I make almost 3x the amount I used to monthly. 

Here's the issue. I was able to pay off my car and am looking for another one currently. My mom (55 year old) does not have a car. She had one that was giving her lots of issues for a couple months and she gave it back. She hasn't had a car in about 10 years. Now she takes the bus or gets rides from family members. I planned on giving her my old car for free. Its probably worth a couple thousand but I'm all about helping out.  She only has to pay insurance, basic liability. She said she doesn't want it and still expects me to drive her around. 

I still have to take additional courses while I work and have to commute 50 min both ways. I will be gone from 6:45 am-7:00pm most nights and until 10:00 pm one night. I asked my mom again if she wanted my old car. She said no so I told her that I won't be driving her around anymore since she passed up a free car. She said, ""You need to start paying rent and pg&amp;e."" I said I would pay the agreed amount and that's it. This includes no rent and $50 for utilities. (She gets government assistance and pays less than $200 for rent. She told me I can move home to save money and switches that up when she gets mad at me.) It goes back and forth a couple times then she literally starts to tear up and says, ""You drive your grandma around."" Flips me off and then goes to her room. I text her saying, ""Grandma literally can not drive. She doesn't have a license because of her age. I have to drive her places."" I drive her places once every 3 months or so. Nothing crazy. Either way, that's her fucking mom and my grandma!

My mom doesn't ask for rides too often but when she does I am completely expected to change my plans. She gets my 2 neices every other weekend (sister is a dead beat mom but their dad allows us get them on her weekends). During this time I am pressured to have my bf drive me around so my mom can do activities with my nieces. 

What the hell do I do? Put my foot down and have her bitter all day? She watches my dog while I'm at work and I would hate for her to be mean to my dog. (She has done this before to my cats).  I am also giving her $1,500 to be nice. I should probably move out because she can be toxic at times but then I won't have any money to save. She'll stop being upset in a couple days but until then she's exhausting. I'm just trying to better my life and help her out.",relationship_advice
t3_chjsej,"Should I let my partner ""Cheat"" on me","Not really cheating, But basically I have absolutely no intention of having sex ever again. But I don't want my boyfriend to have to Miss out because of me. Should I let my boyfriend sleep with other men?",relationship_advice
t3_chjs9t,"Me (f20), him (m24). AITA for thinking his frustration about non-penetrative sex is misplaced?","My boyfriend and I are really comfortable with each other and we've had multiple sit downs about our sexual experiences, good and bad. He's been sexually assaulted, though he can't remember because of being black out drunk. I've never been seriously sexually assaulted to the point of trauma, but have a tendency to get very nervous about the idea of it when the subject pops up in movies or other media. I've had multiple bad experiences with men where I end up failing to tell them I don't want penetration and just dealing with it to get rid of their pestering. 

Lately, I've noticed how horny I get when he's gone and how much I don't mind not having sex when we're together so I decided to reflect on it more and I realized that penetrative sex really doesn't do anything for me. That habit of not being fully open and honest about my sexual preferences has been eating away at me and I decided to open up the conversation to my boyfriend. I told him that I get nervous when I hear about sexual assault stories and rape cases in the news, and that I might not want penetrative sex most of the time. I asked for perhaps more external stimulation where I could receive pleasure without having penetration. Then he asked me what the solution would be for him. I said I didn't know and that I was still trying to figure it out. But then he said that he'd just be jerking himself off in a corner after I'm all good and done. Of course, we both didn't think that was a valid solution. Penetrative sex is still very emotional and meaningful to him so he proposed that we compromise and that I do it sometimes.

Which then I said that I didn't want to compromise in that way and that I shouldn't have to if I'm afraid or uncomfortable with penetration. Which afterward, we were just going back and forth between him saying: ""well, what do I do with myself? Jerk off in the bathroom?"" and me going: ""no, I don't know yet"". He starts to get more and more upset and I tell him that he shouldn't even be upset if it's something that I'm uncomfortable with. I clarify that it really isn't about me receiving a different source of pleasure, it's me avoiding something that gives me discomfort. In my perspective, his pleasure does not equate with me not wanting to be penetrated. A penis does not equal a vagina.

I told him I don't know what the hell to do with his body because I'm not a man. He was still upset and I still don't accept the fact that he's upset with me. The conversation elevates and I said that ""if I were raped or sexually assaulted, we wouldn't even be having this conversation because it should be a given that I'd be uncomfortable with penetration. Why do I need to keep repeating the fact that I'm uncomfortable with it and that I didn't receive that much pleasure beforehand if penetration is already an invasive thing itself"". To me, pleasure or not, having something go inside you is invasive. It's just how it is and if that thing that's going inside you is uncomfortable then you should just take it out, no questions asked and no 'buts'. He repeats again and again that he's upset because I don't have a solution for what to do with him during sex and that we'll just have to wait when we're together (we're in a long-distance relationship) to figure that out.

But I really don't think he should be upset at me, he should be upset and just the situation of not knowing what to do or that he might not be able to receive pleasure through penetrative sex. 

Am I the asshole for thinking that his frustration directed towards me is wrong?

*Edit: advice for non-penetrative sex with the bf not involving toys would be much appreciated too...

---

*Second Edit: Maybe this was unclear before, but I am not claiming to be nor want to be a victim of rape. I mentioned it because I think that if a rape victim chooses not to have penetrative sex, their partner should be more than understanding to not do that. I am FULLY willing to compromise and do anything like oral or handjobs, whatever sort of thing. I'm not asking him to be a sex robot I can take pleasure from... Perhaps there isn't enough context surrounding our relationship but the amount of negativity is seriously uncalled for...

For those who are telling me to seek counselling for past traumas, thanks that advice helps. But for those who are telling me I'm mentally defected.. that's not helping...",relationship_advice

Following much of the advice offered, I managed to get a handful of pictures and videos. Cost me a couple bucks but it was worth it to prove I wasn’t imagining things. Rather than go to the police, I opted to show my buddy. At first he was in denial (laughing it off as nonsense) until he noticed that the oldest picture I took was three days ago. He asked me if I had actually noticed her for a while now and I told him yes.

He seemed pretty overwhelmed, though he did apologize for doubting me. He says he’ll think about what to do before we head off to work (neglected to mention that we work at the same place and live in the same apartment complex which is why I’ve noticed her a lot; sorry for the lack of forethought). He genuinely acts surprised, maybe a bit afraid. I’m wondering if I should take this to the police.

I’ll post updates when they come, but I’m just glad he doesn’t think that I need to be admitted to a psych ward and that he apologized.

EDIT 1

So a lot of people have been asking questions and while I’d like to get to each of them, it’s difficult to Reddit and work at the same time so I’ll be addressing the commonly asked questions and ones that struck a chord with me.

Q1) How do I know it’s not me being stalked?

A1) It’s a fair question. Honestly, I thought it was me at first but then I started traveling alone, watching myself. Either she’s only following me when I’m with my friend or it’s my friend who’s being followed.

Q2) Is my friend in a relationship or legal troubles?

A2) No and no, as far as I know. Unless he’s venting he does t talk about financial or legal troubles and he’s still recovering from a break-up three months ago. And he’s gay.

Q3) Does he recognize her?

A3) If he does, he didn’t say anything to me.

Q4) Do you do pranks often?

A4) He’s one of those people who likes being serious but appreciates a good joke, but this is something neither of us would want.

Q5) Consider hiring a PI.

A5) Tempting, and I will bring that option up if necessary.

Q6) Show us pictures.

A6) As much as I’d like to, I feel as though the sensitivity and uncertainty of the situation calls for caution. If things get dire enough, I’ll consider it. If you doubt me because I refuse to post pictures, then that’s you’re decision. If you believe me or not doesn’t change reality.

Q7) Is this fake?

A7) I fucking wish. I’d like nothing more than for all of this to be an elaborate hoax or joke that winds up me being the punchline.

We’ve decided to go to the police department after we get off work. We both work at the university FYI. More updates will follow afterwards.

EDIT 2 (7/24/19)

I would like to thank everyone for their concern and support. The matter has been resolved, and things are relatively returning back to normal. As far as I’m concerned, this just means I’ll be able to finally get a decent night’s sleep. Thank you and have a wonderful day.

EDIT 3

Sorry for the awful update.l, work is getting a bit hectic, as well as everything else since I’m going on a two week vacation soon with my family.

He constantly brings up the fact that it’s weird I moved out here with him even tho he invited me and even tho I asked him on numerous occasions if he was sure he wanted me to come with which he always responded “of course I couldn’t do it without you.” He constantly brings up how “I’m so in love with him” and “I need to stop being so clingy” but I’m not clingy. If anything’s he’s the clingy one as he’s always blowing up my phone with calls and text. When we were back in Michigan there was a point in time where I thought we were going to end up together because that’s what I was lead to believe because he told me he wanted to be with me. I moved here to be by him oc because he is one of my best friends but I moved for me because I needed out of my comfort zone. I’m getting tired of running in circles to help him with whatever he needs but never get anything in return. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong that he feels the need to treat me like shit 24/7 but still crawls into bed at night apologizes and says he loves me. I’m an idiot who is signed to a year lease with him in a studio and I don’t know how much longer I can keep putting up with him and his ignorance. Lately the thing that annoys me most is his constant criticism for the apartment not being clean (I clean everyday and he doesn’t do anything sometimes I let it go to see if he will do something) and him constantly being in his phone ignoring everything I say to him. I know he’s talking to other girl and that’s fine but I would atleast like to be acknowledged as a person, I’m so tired of him not hearing what I say. 

I’m growing more exhausted everyday and I just need a forum to rant to.

Moving out it is easier said than done as my name is on the lease. And I know he’d be the type to loving in with his family and leave the debt to me. I’ve looked into breaking it but it’s to expensive and I’ve had no luck with subleasers. I’ve mentioned that he should just move in with his family and I keep the apartment but he tells me to shut up and go back to Michigan.",relationship_advice
t3_chg69e,Do I stay a father or becoming single again?,"I recently came to find out from my ex fiance that I am not the father of my 4 year old son. We broke up in august from catching her cheating and also having a separate life from me and her kids. I've spent months to get permanent placement of him and child support started (in may). she works a serving job so I only really get maybe $150 a month for my son. I recently did an at home DNA test and the results were 100% not the father. i brought this up with her and she knows who the real dad is. I contacted him on Facebook and he lives in a different town and says that he talked to my ex and she doesn't want him in the picture. this summer I've been watching my son at night and she watches him during the day. the fact that she is dating the last man she cheated on me  (there has been 5 that I know of from her trickle truth and snooping around). also found out she is pregnant again in may, she is now 9 months pregnant. with either this man she is with now or some guy she works with. I really can't deal with the friendly text i need to do because of my son. The idea i have to deal with her having a new life with this guy is unbearable. I want to be happy and i want to move on from this mess.

t3_chjqq8,My boyfriend chooses the better option over me.,"My boyfriends birthday is coming up and I was planning on going over his house. We are in a long distance relationship so I can’t just go over and see him it’s an all day thing. I’ve told him this for months, I’m coming to be with you on your birthday. 
Well he said his friend asked him to go to his lake house for his birthday instead.  He said I can come over earlier in the week and he’ll spend his birthday with friends.
I was very upset because to me it seemed like he chose the better option. I’ve had many friends do this to me and it hurts like hell. We got into an argument he called me crazy and unreasonable for being upset. I said why didn’t you just ask if I could go with you to the lake house for your birthday and him and his friends voted that it would be better if no girls were allowed. 
I eventually calmed down and said it’s his birthday he can do whatever he wants so I would just come over earlier in the week. 
He texted me today and said he’s going the week before his birthday and that I can come to his house for the birthday. He told his friends he had work... why couldn’t he just tell them that we made plans first.
Anyways besides the point.
We were supposed to hangout this weekend and have been planning this for weeks and he said we can’t hangout this weekend anymore because his friends birthday party is this weekend and he’s going to stay at this house with his friends for the week. He literally did it again. 
I’m not saying he shouldn’t or can’t hangout with his friends, but not when we had plans first. I’m so annoyed. I feel like he will always choose the better option.
Please give me some insight as to if I’m overreacting or this is bad.",relationship_advice
t3_chg3ol,My husband (23M) wants to divorce me (24F) because I was abusive towards him.,"Hello, so this is my first post and I would really like some semi non bias input. 

My husband and I have been married for a little under a year. We met in October of 2018 and decided to elope within a week of being together. We were in California when we met, but due to a bad landloard, and his job being bought out, we had to move in with his parents in Alabama. I  was the only one working still before we moved. So, we pack up what we can and drive from LA to Alabama, and got married in Vegas. It takes us a while to get jobs there for the first month, but we eventually do. He got a job before me, then a month later I get a job. We're doing pretty okay.

Then he decided we should move to Florida. I'm a pretty free spirit, and honestly just enjoy being there for the ride, so I said ""sure, why not"". This is a month after starting my job so I had to leave them short notice, and I felt terrible because I was replacing someone. He got a job offer that would pay him more than what he was making in Alabama. Enough to support us. We take this month to look for places but neither of our credit is good enough to get a decent apartment. Somehow he gets a place to wave the credit check in the area he needs then we pay the deposit and fees, etc. We drive down there with his mom and family friend to help us. Everything is going pretty well.

Then it hits. The company that was to hire him was getting bought out, but they never said anything about it over the phone. They would've made him buy his own tools, use his own car, and gas, and also wouldn't pay him until a month later. So yeah obviously that was a bust. 

I'm obviously looking for a job myself, and I get one about a week or two after the company screwed him over. At this point, I am the only one working and making money supporting us. He's looking for work too but it's hard where we live and his job usually needs some sort of degree/certificate to apply. He's even applying to entry level jobs, cafe, barista, food prep, etc, but for whatever reason he's not getting anywhere. It's fine to me because I know that he's trying and that it is difficult finding work this time of year. 

What I didn't appreciate is that he's home 24/7 right? Quite literally. But he can't bring himself to clean up the house while I'm at work. Simple things like wash the dishes, do the laundry, house work since you know, he's there. Then he tells me he's ""too sick"", ""his body is feeling some ways"", ""I get too overwhelmed trying to clean up after you"". Like okay. I'll work and do some house work too since you're not able to right now. We're married so I can support us until he finds a job. 

After about two weeks into this job I find an ad for a job at a theme park. I tell him about it and he encourages me to try and get it because hey free tickets and whatnot. So I get that job, so now everyday I have to wake up at 3am, so I can drive 45-55 minutes,  work 8 or so hours, then drive back home, and have to clean after being on my feet the whole day. Granted I didn't clean as much as I should, and I can't keep my things clean and organized as much as I try. I'm not perfect, but I tried. 

It was at this time that he started to play D&amp;D online to make new friends. That's cool, whatever makes him happy. The only issue was that they played at night when I had work the next day, and our walls are pretty thin. I tried wearing earplugs and having him wake me, but that didn't work out. I asked if he could just switch his days, but that apparently couldn't happen. So, I work around it. This goes on for about 3 months. Keep in mind that he hasn't held a stable job since we got here.

During the 4th of July, I had to travel back to LA for my sister's wedding. This is a big deal for all of us, since this is the only wedding all my sisters can attend. We wanted to both go, but only I could go because my sister paid for my ticket already, and tickets started to double in price. We didn't have enough to get him a ticket too. He decided it's a good time to meet his online friends in real life, since he doesn't want to be alone. That's great. Have fun and enjoy your time with like minded people. 

While in LA we still text and call, and it's a lot of missing each other. I have to preface this by saying I am confident in myself and I  live by ""it is what it is"". The second night that I'm there we're talking on the phone, and he asks me for my permission if he can sleep with one of his friends. Now, I know what some of you are thinking. Did I really tell him yes. Of course I did. I've given him passes before because to me sex is just sex unless you try to make it more. At the end of the day I'm still his wife and he's still my husband. If he wants something that I can't give him then he's free to seek it out if he wants. Just a few rules: no kissing, cuddling, holding hands, don't get emotionally attached, wear a condom, NOT ON OUR BED. He told me that he couldn't do it and I thought that was the end of that. Wrong. 

We were texting and I was getting anxious because I knew being apart was hard on both of us, but I was also getting mad because I was feeling the pressure of being the only one working. I said a few things and told him that if he didn't care then I didn't have to come back. That I would stay with my family for a while until he figured things out. I could tell by his replies that he was done. I knew that he would sleep with his friend and I knew that when I got back he's going to divorce me. And yeah. It happened. He slept with her on our bed, in the apartment that was supposed to be our home. He did use a condom at least. The instant I get back he tells me we're getting a divorce and there's no changing his mind. To say that I was heartbroken is an insult. I cried harder than I ever thought possible. What's worst is that one of his other friends was still staying with us.

He promised me you guys.. He promise that he would never leave and that we'd always be together, because he would always love me.. Now, I'm still the only one with a job paying for everything. But now that girl is his ""girlfriend"" while we're still married and living together.. Even right now he's on a vacation with her in a different city with other friends. He told me he was coming home tonight. But earlier he called just to tell me ""oh I'm actually going to stay here another night. Don't worry, nothing's changed. I'll be back tomorrow night. I'm having so much fun here."" Like really.. You're doing the thing that I said I could do but didn't. I didn't stay in California, I went back to him. I was determined that after my last trip I would try to be there for him more, because I know I haven't really been there for him emotionally. 

I get angry at little things and my anger sometimes gets directed towards him. I'm not good at controlling my emotions and I cry a lot because I feel like none of this is fair to me. I'll admit that I was selfish in some ways. I said things that hurt him and I wasn't mindful of his feelings. He has anxiety issues and they manifest physically with him, so his body shuts down and he starts getting sick and throwing up. I should've seen the signs.. I realized though that he gave up on us when I started my current job.. He admitted it to me too that he stopped trying 3-4 months ago.. That all his ""friends"" agree that I'm abusive and that he needs to divorce me..

There's a lot of detail missing, and this is only from my perspective.. I'm trying to figure out what my next steps are.. I just wanted to get this out to someone other than people that I know.. Am I in the wrong... Am I the problem.. Should I just give up too... 

Sadly, I still love him and want him to stay.. He's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.. I know it's silly to still want that even after everything that's happened..

t3_chhhhy,Anybody have any experiences with breaks?,"I’m young and stupid. I don’t have much experience in relationships.

My girlfriend and I (19) have hit an incredibly rough patch in our relationship after 6 months long distance. I honestly don’t know if I can even call her my girlfriend at the moment, as much as it hurts to say. 

There have been some complicated things regarding her ex when our relationship started that had created  a prominent trust issue for me. I want to make it clear that she didn’t do anything wrong. I just feared that I could have been treated the same way. 

What had worried me was that every time I had tried to bring my insecurity up about it, she would get offended. I love her with all my heart, but I feel like my insecurities finally ruined what I thought was perfect. I take the blame. I know how hurtful it can be to feel like you are not trusted. I did trust her. And I absolutely detest myself for hurting her.

This had created sort of a rift. She told me she wanted to take a “break” and just enjoy life until IF we ever click again. I don’t know what that means. I am treating it right now as a breakup. Tonight was the first night that she didn’t say “I love you” or goodnight. As long distance it hurts. 

I’m supposed to see her for the first time in three weeks.

I would be lying if I said I wasn’t scared. I hate how anxious I am. How questioning I could be. But this has been something that I couldn’t let go. I just know that one day I’ll be able to.

Basically I just wanna know if anyone had any experiences with having “breaks” in relationships and if there is any chance it could heal into something better. I understand most would suggest working on myself and moving on. I am just honestly afraid of the latter, but I understand.

Thank y’all.",relationship_advice
t3_chhhdd,"Me (23M), ex gf (20F) she lied about the breakup?","Cliff:
- 2.5 years together
- She broke up because she needed to “find herself”, “it isn’t you it’s me”
- Probably in a rebound already
-2 months broken up

Long story short, she broke up I tried to get her back (never begged or any crying) we both matched on tinder 1 week after breakup and she said “this confirmed things”. Honestly the breakup came out of the blue, and I’m pretty sure her classmate that she started to Snapchat and hang around with was the reason for the breakup.

I didn’t react to them snapchatting etc, didn’t want to seem jealous. I saw them hanging out together once after the breakup and she gave me a hug in front of him for super long, then I saw that she went out on a date with him the same night. Don’t ask me how I found out lol.

Today I was hanging around with a couple of friends just drinking and having fun and then I saw this guy walking into the street where her apartment is.

My only question is, how the flying fuck was she able to move on so fast? Like I’ve been NC for 34+ days and not once has she reached out. We were together for fucking 2.5 years and she didn’t have the decency to tell me the truth? She said she had problems and was going to start with therapy and just needed time alone. And now she’s banging this guy she told me was ugly and just a fucking friend? How am I supposed to trust girls ever again. 

I’m in such a good shape now, packed on tons of muscles, making new friends everywhere, new job and traveling a lot and having fun. Mentally I’m in a really good place as well, but seeing this fucking asshole going to her apartment to probably have sex with my ex hurts so fucking much. Like they have probably been fucking hooking up right after the breakup? She must have been emotionally cheating at least?

I’m just really pissed of right now, I just don’t understand how she could throw it all away for a piece of shit guy like that...",relationship_advice
t3_chhhdc,Ex fiancé and I broke up because he didn’t want kids and I did. Now he’s dating a woman with two kids?,"My ex fiancé and I broke up back in December, we had a lot of differences but ultimately loved eachother and had been together 6 years. After an argument one day he just said he was done, I asked why and he said that he didn’t want kids and I do, and also that we argue a lot (edit: we only argued once every few months, like normal couples do) He left the house and said he wouldn’t return until I packed and left, I tried to contact him but he completely ignored me, I moved out and back home with family. We have only spoken once since then and that was a month ago he told me he still loved me then the next week ghosted again.

Two years ago I had a miscarriage, but even before that he didn’t want kids.

Now he just started seeing a single mother with two kids who is “separated” from her husband as of October. 

I’m just not sure what to think about this, he made me feel horrible about wanting to have kids and said he didn’t want to be a dad and didn’t want the responsibility and wasn’t sad about my miscarriage, now he’s putting himself in a situation to be a stepfather?

Edit: kids was not a dealbreaker for me, if we never had them I would have been fine. It was something I would have liked to do, but I would have been fulfilled if we never did.",relationship_advice
t3_chjnqp,I don’t know whether or not I should break up with my best friend,"It’s not that dramatic but I’m using a throwaway because I’m a little paranoid. (Also I’m new to posting so sorry if this isn’t that good) Me and my girlfriend have been dating for years now, since we were freshman in high school. I knew right when I saw her I wanted to date her and now we’re both in college still going strong, she’s my best friend in the whole world.. Throughout that whole time everybody said we were the cutest couple and we even won prom king and queen (sorry to flex). I’m from a small town so our relationship got quite honestly a weird amount of attention. Meanwhile I come from a poor not the best home so her parents basically adopted me. To be honest I’m like a total mooch they pay for all of my meals buy me clothes a lot I feel bad about it but they’re so sweet they won’t let me refuse. Anyway recently she told me she didn’t want kids. Her reasoning was totally fair and I think it’s entirely her choice and she even said she would understand if I broke up with her. I told her it was okay because we’ve got time and one of us might change our minds (sorry if that sounds like the whole “you’ll change your mind eventually” thing girls get a lot, I might also change my mind). But I really really want kids. And ever since she said that it’s been stuck in my head and I can’t decide if I should break up with her or not. I don’t want to lose her as my best friend plus her family has done so much for me it’s like I’m robbing them, and I feel like I’ll ruin this picture perfect image of our relationship so many people have and that’s kind of a bummer. I know that last ones a dumb thing to worry about but when people have been saying “you’ll have the cutest babies together” since you were fourteen a lot of pressure builds up. Anyway, idk what to do and I’m honestly too nervous to talk to her. Do I break up with her now before we go back to school? Wait until later? Wait until one of us changes our mind? I don’t want to get married and end up regretting it and losing her as a friend and I also am worried if I don’t break up with her now I’ll miss out on someone else and just waist both of our times. But I don’t want to lose her and Idk if I want someone else. Anyway sorry for the long over dramatic post but, help me reddit you’re my only hope.",relationship_advice

We had a fight around 2 weeks before this that I think had something to do with it. But anyway I agreed to give each other some time away (i didn’t beg her to get back with me or anything) and at first she really missed me and talked to me every night like we were still dating. and then she started to become more distant with me out of nowhere. I tried no contact for a couple weeks, but we ended up just talking again. She would get really hot and cold with me, but I never really asked her what we were to each other. She’s in my friend group so I can’t block her out of my life. And a few weeks ago, on a group facetime with our friends referred to me as her ex boyfriend, so I guess we aren’t on a break anymore, we’re just broken up I guess. We talk almost every day now, but I think she just sees me as a friend even though I still have feelings for her.

t3_chjm8w,"My (32M) step-daughter (9F) is being treated differently by the man she was raised to believe was her father than his biological son (her brother) and she’s asking questions. What’s going to be worse for her, to find out now or to find out later?","(All names have been changed) My wife Jane (28F) is the mother to two amazing children, Sarah (9F) and Joe (6M).  She had Sarah when she was eighteen and fled an abusive relationship with her.  I am constantly amazed by her resilience, intelligence, and dedication to her children.  After escaping with Sarah she met Will, and they had Joe together.  Sarah was still in infancy and Will decided to raise her as his daughter since they had had a son and were starting a family.

Normally I would have no problem with this situation and consider him to be her father, but he has half-assed it.  He was prepared to adopt her until he met his current wife and left Jane for her.  He then cancelled the adoption and stopped taking her as much as he takes her brother.  Sarah and Joe still believe themselves to be share the same father.  She’s begun to ask why dad doesn’t take her home as much as brother (he takes her for two days every other week) and when he comes to pick Joe up he doesn’t acknowledge her as much.

Jane doesn’t know what to do, she knows it’s going to hurt eventually but she doesn’t know what will be worse for her daughter, for her to find out now or to find out later.  The questions Sarah asks lead me to believe she knows something is amiss.

Sarah loves her dad and lights up every time she sees him, even if it’s just when he’s there to get her brother (which bums me out more).  It kills Jane too because his family treats him like he’s a saint for still having anything to do with Sarah since she’s not his when I think it’s worse for a kid to have a part-time dad.  

If someone who’s been in a similar situation could help us with some advice that would be great.

Also, I am planning on adopting Sarah regardless.  I love her as if she was my daughter, but if we decide to let her live as if Will is her father I don’t really care as long as I know she will have a home if something happens to Jane because I don’t trust Will to take her in and I would rather die than see her go back to her biological father.",relationship_advice

t3_ch4j39,My (31f) husbands (32m) mental illness has ruined my love for him.,"I will try to condense this as much as I can. 

For a bit of background we have been together for 15 years and married for almost 9. Before my husbands mental illness our marriage was great. 

Six years ago, when our first child was born, my husband developed quiet severe anxiety and depression. He was in a high stress job at the time and this exacerbated his illness. He became very angry and unreasonable. He also became verbally and emotionally abusive towards me and to a lesser extent, our children. I didn’t realise at the time that what was happening was abuse. I thought it was my fault somehow and that I was failing as a wife and mother. It all eventually came to a head around 15 months ago when I told him I was no longer happy in our marriage and he promised me he would get help. Well he did. He left his job, got therapy and went of medication and things are returning back to “normal”. 

However I can not get over how he treated me during those years and I don’t think I love him anymore because of it. I waked on eggshells, too afraid to say anything or speak up for fear of being verbally abused. He constantly criticised me and my decisions. He belittled me about my parenting skills and my post natal depression. He would go on abusive tirades for hours about all sorts of things. My “uselessness”, how I was raised, my family. Basically anything that he felt wasn’t “right”. He refused to help me with the kids or spend any time with us. He accused me of only being with him for his money, of not appreciating how hard he works, of being lazy and “doing nothing but sitting on my arse” all day. He banned me from being friends with certain people and almost convinced me my family didn’t care about me and walked all over me. I could continue on, but you get the point. 

I’m trying to get past this but I just can’t. We did go to counselling but I feel the therapist excused his behaviour because of his illness. It makes me so resentful and bitter towards him because I did not deserve to be treated like this. 

But on the flip side, he got help. He’s back to his normal self and I know he does love me. Would I be an asshole if I left? Abandoning my husband because he was mentally ill. My kids love him and he’s much more present in their lives now. He actually smiles and engages with us now rather then scowling and criticising. I’m so confused about what to do. I’m only 31 and I don’t want to look back and realise I wasted my life on a man I didn’t truly want to be with. But what if leaving him is a huge mistake? I just don’t know what to do.

Edit: thanks to everyone who took the time to offer advice and opinions. It’s good to see this issue from a lot of different perspectives. It given me a lot to think about. I just want to make it clear that I would never leave him because he had a mental illness, it’s because of the way he treated me during those years and the lasting effect it’s had on me. It’s ruined my love for him and I don’t think it’s fair to keep him in a marriage where he is not loved like he deserves to be.

t3_chjiwv,My gf's [17f] sex drive has lowered a lot and it's causing a lot of strain on the relationship for me [19m].,"I want to preface this by saying I love my girlfriend to death and I feel awful about the way I feel and what's going on. Recently her sex drive has lowered a lot and it's been causing a lot of strain for me. She has started the pill and I'm 99% sure it's because of that, but it still doesn't make me feel better. I still have that nagging feeling that I'm not doing enough for her sexually, or she's losing attraction for me. She tells me that she isn't losing feelings and I believe her. But there's still that thought in the back of my head and it's eating away at me. It's causing me to feel a little disdain but I know I love her. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me. She's my first relationship and I actually do really believe she's my soul mate. But both of us do sometimes get insecure about how much the other person loves us. And I feel like this is one of those times where I'm just being insecure. I feel rejected or neglected in a way and it hurts, a lot. She said that if I ever really wanted to have sex that she wouldn't turn me down, but I would feel bad if I did it when she really wasn't in the mood. But I'm starting to feel like that might be the option I need to take. I would feel horrible if I didn't it and she didn't. But the past couples times and since she's started the pill really she hasn't wanted to have sex as much. She changed pills and at the beginning her sex drive was really high, like on par with mine, and I thought things were going to be different. But it slowed down again and now I'm back to feeling upset. She also has a vibrator from her previous relationship (because she talked about how her ex had a small penis and he didn't satisfy her so she had him buy one). And recently we hung out for a bit then I had to head to work and she told me she was going to use it by sending a snap of it and saying that. I joked telling her to not lose her sex drive so she'd still wanna have sex that night (I wanted to but I didn't tell her that figuring it would be implied). And she used it and didn't want to have sex later. I was so hurt by the fact that she used a stupid toy to get off and didn't want to do it with me. I felt betrayed and neglected. And I'm worried I'm gonna get pissed if she does it again and then doesn't want to have sex. I don't think it's right if she's using toys to get off instead of having sex with me. I told her the day I found out about her vibrator that I didn't care if she used it. At that point I still masturbated and I had no problem if she did either. But now I don't know what to feel if she doesn't it again and doesn't want to have sex with me. I don't feel the need to masturbate and I haven't for a while. Since I've started talking to her porn has lost its interest and I can't masturbate without thinking about or looking at pics of her. And I decided to jack off again after a long while to see if it would help and it didn't do much. I made less advances but I don't know if it was because I masturbated, or if it was because I have told her and I've been working on toning it down with sexual advances. But it feels like the more I try to tone it down the worse I feel and the more upset about it I get. I'd also like to add that I recently lost my virginity to her (like less than 2 months ago at the time of writing) and I feel like that plays a major role in this too. I think my hormones are still just off the charts, but I can't get them under control and it's causing me to feel bad about it too. I just feel awful for not being able to control my libido and I always feel bad when I make advances and she doesn't reciprocate. I had always told myself that I wouldn't be that guy who's only in a relationship for sex. And I told her at the beginning of our relationship pretty much and have reassured her over and over (because of the times when she's insecure about the relationship) that I'm not only dating her for sex. And I'm not, I truly do love her and I think she is the one. I think she's incredibly beautiful and we get along together incredibly well. She respects everything I do and all my opinions. And I do the same for her. We've already talked about our future and we help each other when we get the chance. We spend almost all out spare time together, but we are the only people we really wanna spend time with. When I'm not with her I'm just bored and miss her and she is the same way. It feels like she loves me more than anyone else has in my entire life. And I don't want to lose her ever. My point is I'm not only dating her for sex, but I want to have sex with her. I love the intimacy and the raw emotion we have when we do it. It makes me feel alive and in love with her more than I ever have been. I feel like everytime I look at her differently than before. I feel like I love her more than I ever have. And I feel hurt and upset and annoyed when she doesn't want to have sex. Then I get upset with feeling that way and it's just a horrible cycle. She knows how upset it makes me and how I want to change, so she doesn't judge me or dislike me more. But your brain tries to play tricks on you and it's making me think she doesn't love me or is attracted to me anymore even though I know that's not the case. It's just an awful situation and I don't know what to do or what to think. I truly enjoy spending time with her and I really love her. I need help. Please.",relationship_advice
t3_chfvbc,[21/m] My long time best friend [21/m] cuddled with my crush/friend [20/f] in secret and did not tell me about it,"I want to start from the beginning. I know my best friend since primary school and now we are friends for 14 years. I work with him and my Crush which I got to know through work. I got along very well with the girl and he did too. We became very good friends. But I only know her for 4 months, but that was enough for me to fall in love with her. 

The problem was that she couldn't return these feelings and only saw friendship in them. This has pulled me down for some time and I and the girl also had some quarrels from time to time that didn't do us any good. I howled at my best friend and talked to him about my feelings. I always felt very safe with both of them and could always be open. 

He also knew that I had a crush on her. While all this was happening they also wrote a lot. But they only talked about their ex-partners, because both had to go through hard separations and needed a partner to talk to. I couldn't help them both because I didn't know that feeling. 

In order to cope with my one-sided feelings, I kept my distance and reduced the contact to the girl a lot. Now we are in the present. 

Today I met with my friend after work and I noticed that something was on his heart. He told me that they met a few days ago and cuddled together. He showed me his text conversations with her and they both called each other ""babies"" and sent hearts. They wanted to cuddle again and missed the time. When I experienced this, I became very angry. I felt betrayed by my best friend and by my girlfriend.

I never thought they would do this to me. Both knew that I still had feelings for them but still did. Both told me they didn't want it and knew it was wrong and that they would hurt me with it. Whatever they did in the end. It was a back and forth. They apologized and assured me that it was not their intention to hurt me. But they did. 

I didn't know how to react and just drew a line. I broke off contact with both of them for now. But I will see them at work and we have already planned a holiday together with other friends. I don't know if I should forgive them, if I can do it at all... Should I forgive them? Should I talk with them in a calmer mood?

tl;dr My longtime best friend whom I already know since the elementary school has cuddled with my Crush and has told me only afterwards of it.",relationship_advice
t3_chjiuw,I need help on this,"Mobile user, blah blah blah...
(Kind of cross posted, but I’m adding my thoughts on more now, sorry if the lower half doesn’t fit)

So I’m 14M and there was a girl I met on Snapchat last night. We texted all night and still are. I guess we both clicked, we had a lot of opinions in common about a relationship (or “relationship”). Well after about an hour of texting, (we kept saying things like “I want someone that’ll do this...) I asked, do you think were talking about eachother?

She said yeah and now she is saying I love you. I was (and kind of still am) pretty deep in my feels. This girl is a grade below me, but I’m one of the youngest (but not shortest) guys in my grade. We fit pretty well.

Well she started talking about her sucking other guys dicks and her getting fingered and making out and all that stuff. I asked why, she said she just let them do it.

Now I’m going into high school and never had a first kiss yet. So, this is kind of turning me away, I want someone that will be our first everything. 

But the thing that started changing my ideas was when she texted me she’s going to her moms house.
And she sent me a snap of a housing thing for like foster kids (I’m not too sure what it’s called).



Since this was online, I didn’t get to see her much. But she sent a few pictures of herself, and she isn’t exactly seem fit. I’m always outside and am trying to do something. She seems nice online and everything. But she doesn’t physically attract me. She also calls me a racist slang, I didn’t say much and she is white (I’m asian).

TL;DR (ish):

A few nights ago I was talking to this girl, we got along well and clicked. She says I love you out of nowhere, but I don’t think I could exactly end it(?) she said that last time someone broke up with her, she had to go into a mental hospital. I like her online side, but not her physical side.

Thank you.

EDIT::::::

I did it.

The famous last lines of me were 

“it was absolutely wonderful talking with you, I loved it as much as you did. I’m sorry to say this, but I don’t think I’m ready for a relationship. Or anything sexual. I’m sorry but I don’t think it’s going to work out. I wish you the best of luck in life.”

I’ll remove her as a friend, blocking her immediately will prevent her from seeing this.

t3_chfuw8,My ex has returned,"So here is the gist of everything that’s happened:
After two months of no-contact, my long distance ex-bf named Guy started texting me last week about the most insignificant things. He obviously just wanted to hear from me and test the waters. I stayed polite and obliged. When we broke up, I gave him an ultimatum about what I required from him if he ever wanted to come back around. I know that he did at least one of those things because it was find a therapist. 

He has issues. He made a point of telling me that he’s working on himself when we finally had the big talk, that he wanted things to be different. He also offered me almost everything I ever complained about in the relationship when he always had some excuse as to why he couldn’t give it to me before. He seemingly realized my worth, appreciated me and said it was unbearable to be without me. 

Skip to today, Guy seems to have changed for the better and has been great! The rest of the things in the ultimatum have yet to reach fruition. I gave him until November to do the things I asked. So it’s far away but I want to let him know that just because I allowed us to converse on a regular basis again, does not mean he doesn’t have to see his part through. I can just see it, that November comes around and he will give me more excuses. How can I let him know how important those things are to me which hounding him. I’m trying to be as positive as I can. I do want to get back together but there are things I need and want. 

I have such a weakness for him, I can acknowledge that, he is my first love. Still, I want to hold my ground and be able to walk away in November if I need to. I never make excuses when he needs help with something or anything else. More often than not, he has in the past. I need to let him know how strongly I feel about this. But how?",relationship_advice
t3_chfu9i,Update Am I morally respondsible for my stbx health for the sake of her kids,"Please read my earlier posts. I moved the stbx in for the weekend. My 10 year old has been so exited that she is back even though he sees her almost everyday. Saturday comes she goes missing early morning. I don't try to call I am trying to keep distance. In afternoon we , 10 yr old and I, go to pick up his 14 yr old brother who was away at a youth camp through our church. On the way over I told the little guy to let me break the news about his mom. As we are waiting with the other families for the bus to drop off he is running around with his friends. The bus shows up. As everyone is unloading he runs to his brother gives a big hug and says very loudly ""Mom's home"". The older boy looks over at me . If he was older I would say the look was WTF. I just nodded. As we walked to the car I said I would explain. So as we drove I explained the situation as best I could trying not to leave out anything but be sensitive of their feelings of their grandparents and mother.

When we arrive home she is there. The boys embrace her. There are tears every where the 14 yr disolved in all the wetness. He just sobbed. Now the older boy I always thought has been very stoic during this whole mess. This was out of character for him. These boys clung to her the rest of the night.

Sunday comes, I hear her in the kitchen. I come out say good morning, some pleasantries.  She heads back to her room . I get the boys up. Got them fed then dressed for church. They asked if mom was coming? I told them to ask her. She would love to go. So we all went to church together first time in 2 months. I could feel the stares all through the service. After church as we are about to go many came over to us. Most do not know what is going on. When asked about her I would deflect on just say she was away. Now, these people are looking at her physical condition. They think she has been sick. One nice lady admonished me for not asking for help for the kids and around the house. I quickky gathered everyone and went home. The kids again clung to her most of the day. Then she said she had to go and was gone for a few hours. I have no idea where.

Monday comes . My case worker had text night before that they had a bed in the shelter. They would be by Monday mid morning. I called my boss, explained I needed yet another vacation day to handle this. My work has been terrific through all this. They come to pick her up. The little guy has a week of day camp this week. He refused to go. He went into complete meltdown. Then the 14 yr old started in. The case workers are taking this all in. They pulled me aside. They are still in therapy right? Yes. Next week because of the day camp. They suggested I get them in as soon as possible. They started talking together and asked if it was too much of an inconvenience if she stay a while longer. I said okay. The workers were very concerned about this seperation anxiety. They asked if the therapist said anything about it . No. Never been mentioned in those words. I was to watch for acting out.

I know I misread that the boys missed her in our home. They have lived here almost ten years. So now I got to question the quality of therapy my boys are receiving. Anyone out there been through something like this? Had issues with therapist?",relationship_advice
t3_chh9aa,Help me save this relationship with a gamer,"Boyfriend (27M) and I (31F) have been together for 2 years. I have 3 kids of my own and we are due to have his first in September. He is a great guy in nearly every way except that he is a gaming addict. I mean, he calls it a hobby but realistically if you work an 8 hour shift then come home and game for 6 or 7 hours then shower and give me the last hour of your day before youre too tired to stay up anymore...is that really a hobby? I consider that a priority. I might be the hobby but more so feel like an obligation. I'll be the 1st to admit I'm needy. I like attention. When I met him he didnt have a computer or anything. I bought him one as I was led to believe he was a casual gamer. That was in February of LAST YEAR and things have been pretty shit since then. Moments of goodness if we leave the house but most of his time is just gaming. And lately if not on the game (like in the car or laying in bed) then he is watching youtube videos of people gaming. Its nuts! And me being someone who needs a lot of interaction and socializing with my partner, I just feel really back burnered and neglected. He honestly thinks because hes in the room with me with his back turned away at the desk but is responding to my commentary on random things (usually reddit) that that constitutes spending time. It doesn't. We are having an infant soon and while I dont doubt for a second he will be helpful and involved when needed, I know the changes to come are critical. Babies bring a lot of change and our whole dynamic will be different. From being tired all the time and if shes a fussy baby and slacking with household chores while chained to the baby breastfeesing and getting the other kids to school and back and doing homework and making sure we are all fed...its a lot of work and often relationships fail if theyre not strong enough. And he just has not been putting in the work on this relationship. So I told him as much...

2 weeks ago today we got into it pretty badly. My kids have been in another state visiting my sister and this would have been a great time to really connect and work on being a team. It hasnt been the case though. So I told him as much, as I usually do. As always, he gets defensive and I come off as nagging to him. Theres no winning the argument either. Its not about him being right or me being right...its that we need to make time for us and that starts with moderating game time. He had previously stated he would play 1.5 hours after work only but never stuck to it. So two weeks ago, I wrote him a text from bed (as he was in the livingroom gaming all night) basically laying it all out: I deserve a person who wants to be around me. I deserve to feel like a priority and he deserves to be with someone who makes him want to be around them (or no one at all if gaming is all he really wants!). I wasnt rude. I talked about co-parenting, offered to move the kids to my room and let him have the other room so he could still be around for the baby when shes too small to be away from me during the breastfeeding stages. I just want to be happy. And I'm not the only one who deserves it. It was a very civil message. Then I went to bed. Hours later he came to bed and woke me up to tell me he had boxed his computer up and was giving it up for a while. He said I was more important and i was Right and deserved his time. He thought boxing it up was the best action because ""out of sight, out of mind"". He isnt good at moderation so he took the whole temptation away. We have spent the last 2 weeks just being our old selves again. Laughing and hanging out, various dates out of the house for solo or group outings. Just connecting.

Yesterday he came home from work and says he feels like gaming. So he hooks it all back up. This was at 4:30pm. I admit, there were some internet issues so it took him a while to be able to actually play. We ran to Taco Bell then came home and I ate on the bed while he sat on the computer and got it working. That was around 7pm. At 12:30am he decides to shower and get in bed because I said ""its the 1st day gaming again and youve already been on the computer for 8 hours."" He got mad and said he wasnt even playing that whole time. I let it go. He showered and I said i was too tired to watch our show and we went to sleep. Today he was off work. I babysit a child in our home so i get up early every day. Wednesdays i let him sleep in and hang with the kid in the other room with toys. He woke up around 10 this morning and came to sit with me while he drank coffee. Then got on the computer. He is still on the computer. It is 9:30 right now. 

I'm kind of at my wits end. If I'm nice, doesnt matter. If I let it go, it'll be past when I'm asleep. If I mention it in passing, ""yeah im getting off in a minute"" and hours will go by. He asked me at 7 if I wanted to watch our show and I said yes...hes still gaming though. If I'm mean then I'm ""controlling"" and he ""cant be with someone who wont let him be himself."" 

Part of me wants to let it all go and say fuck it. Just let this fade away until we are strangers. Part of me says wait til the baby gets here and see what changes are made. The emotional pregnant part of me wants to spiral out of control and spew all my dark negative thoughts about how this us dehumanizing to me to be less than a machine and just ugly cry and pack his shit up while hes at work and let him figure life out on his own. But the biggest part of me wants his attention more than anything else in the world. More than that, I want him to WANT to be around me without being reminded im here and not take for granted we live together. But I dont know how to make him see that. Its been only 2 days since the computer is up again and its back to how it used to be. 

Idk what to do, reddit. Does anyone have solid advice that isnt ""counseling""...we are broke af so thats not an option. Ive tried linking articles to him on gaming addiction to no avail so thats not really a good one either. Did anyone go through this and survive unscathed?",relationship_advice
t3_chjgsd,How do you tell if you’re still in love?,"I feel lost nowadays in my relationship, and I honestly can’t tell if I’m in love anymore or just feeling stuck. 

My (23F) boyfriend (28M) and I have been together for a few years, and after a lot of hardship between us, I can’t help but think we are both staying together because we are comfortable. Or... at least I think my boyfriend is. 

(I’ll start off with all of my faults because I don’t want to crap on my SO the whole time in this.) I’ve become lazy and depressed a lot of the time. I work a lot and haven’t been taking care of myself that much anymore. So I can understand how that can be annoying to my SO. He gets angry at me a lot and it’s usually for silly things, but also because I didn’t do the laundry or I didn’t clean the kitchen before he got to it. He’s very clean and sensitive to things like that. I haven’t been doing my job of trying to keep up with his needs in that area and I’m working on being better for him. I still work out and spend time at the gym, but when I go home I tend to just stay in bed because I don’t have the emotional energy to do anything else. These are things he’s brought up that bother him and I agree that I need to be better in those areas. I’m aware and actively trying to change. 

On the other hand I try and express my feelings and needs to my SO, but I feel as though they just go in one ear and out the other. My boyfriend doesn’t seem to enjoy a lot of the same things that I do physically, or emotionally even. I’m very affectionate and I like being engaged a lot. I like to talk to my SO’s and pick their brain! I just like to feel connected often through conversation or physical contact. That doesn’t seem to be important to my SO and I can’t tell if it’s just his personality or if he just doesn’t know how to leave our relationship. It often makes me feel unwanted, unloved, and as if he doesn’t care about me. Usually when it gets bad and I bring it up he just asks “why don’t you just leave then?”. 

Don’t get me wrong when I bring these things up and we “work things out”, he’s very good for a few days, maybe even a month and it’ll still be good. He’s very loving over text too! Things always slip back to not much talking, lots of arguing, me getting upset and hurt because I feel like he doesn’t care about me at all, me getting depressed... ect ect. It’s a big circle and we do it so often that I just give up a lot of the time. It feels like a chore to get him to talk to me or be physical with me a lot and I don’t know how to handle this anymore. I guess I’m just seeking advice on how to handle this or if anyone has had a similar situation? Maybe I’m overreacting as well. I care about him immensely and I really just want him to be happy. I also want to feel happy and secure. I just don’t know if we’re just hurting each other at this point. 

TL;DR I don’t even know how to shorten it tbh my boyfriend just gets mad at me a lot and I don’t feel love from him more often than not 🤷🏻‍♀️",relationship_advice
t3_chjgrj,BM even ruins therapy. What’s the point?,"BM and my BF gave 50/50 but she seems to be the only one who makes decisions. I wanted the kids in therapy (his daughter and my daughter both 4) she throws a fit and says they can’t see the same therapist. Okay, makes it harder but whatever. 

My daughters therapist says this isn’t going to work unless we do it as a family, perfect that’s what I want, therapy that helps us blend our family. BF goes to therapy session, therapist tells BF that his daughter also needs to come so we can blend this family. my BF laughs in her face and tells her there’s no way BM would allow that. 

So not only is BM being petty. She’s pushing our family even further away from connecting. I’m so fed up and exhausted trying so hard to save my relationship and make this blended family flow and everyone feeling included and loved.

t3_ch37ch,How can I (21F) become okay with my boyfriend (23M) saying mean things during intimate moments?,"I wouldn’t say I’m a completely vanilla person, I enjoy certain things but yeah with everything people are into nowadays, I’m vanilla. I like simple things like some spanking, dirty talk, things like that. My boyfriend is pretty much the same but he’s more intense. I like handcuffs and being sexy and teasing and all that. He would prefer tying me to my bed and blindfolding me. I like spanking to the point of skin turning pink, he likes bruising and biting and getting rough. Same with dirty talk, I like “oh you like that? You’re naughty” Lol basic stuff like that whereas he really really gets off on saying abusive things. Things like calling me his whore, cum bucket (never even heard of this before him), saying things like “do you wanna do x y z? I don’t care what you say, we’re gonna do what I want.” Things way more graphic than that but I don’t wanna go into too much detail. We don’t do the tying up or spanking pretty often since we just don’t have a ton of time, that stuff needs hours. But the dirty talk is easier to incorporate so he says those things all the time. 

We have a safe word but he really loves saying those things like I’ve noticed the difference from before when we did it vanilla to now after we had a discussion and talked about we like. So I don’t tell him to stop or anything. But it does kind of hurt my feelings, to be completely honest. I don’t like being called a disgusting slut. I know he doesn’t really mean it like he loves me and outside of that, he’s so sweet and adores me. But it just makes me cringe and it gives me a bad feeling in my stomach. It just makes me feel like a bad person. I can’t even describe it. Like I feel ashamed for wanting sex like I really am a slut or something. It’s worse when I initiate sex because the talk just gets more severe and he says things like I’m begging to be used and I’m such a whore and all this stuff. I don’t like initiating it anymore because then it just becomes focused on how disgusting I am for wanting it. Does this even make sense? I know a ton of girls like this stuff so maybe I’m weird and overly sensitive but it hurts my feelings. Sometimes it’s fine, the milder stuff is okay and then he’ll say something really disgusting like I’m just a warm place for him to finish and I’m worthless and that seriously makes me wanna cry. I know it’s just sex role play but it gets to me.

So at 1, appointments at 2 I ask if she still wants me to go she says that it’s fine she’ll go alone. That’s fine with me doesn’t matter, I tell her to text me how it goes. Now it’s 4 and I haven’t heard from her so I text her and ask how it went. She says it was 1-2 hour wait and she didn’t even go.

t3_chh4qt,Holding it all together,"Sorry in advance if this is kind of long.  My husband and I started dating in our early 20's and married a few years later.  He worked nights and I worked days for the fisrt 5-7 years of our relationship/marriage.  I think because of this I missed a lot of what was to come.
5 years into our marriage we both had good jobs and were making a good combined salery(150,000+).  We got pregnant with our first child, bought a house, and he got a big raise all in one year.  I left my job to be a stay at home mom, he got layed off, our home lost half it's value(2008), and I got pregnant with our second all in the next year.  
Over the next few years our income was up and down.  At first he freelanced and made enough to keep us afloat.  After about a year and a half of that he had a complete nervous breakdown and could not return to work.  During that time I sold anything and everything I could to keep us going.  I starting going to garage sales, estate sales and auctions.  Buying what I could and selling it online.    I now was a stay at home mom to 2 little ones selling what ever I could one eBay to try to pay bills.  Through all this my focus was on our children and trying to make their childhood as normal as possible.  
5 years ago a friend of my husband's got him a job at a local community college.  A year later my youngest started school and I got a full time job with mother's hours.  We were making 1/4 of what we were and we lost our house last year.  
We are currently living in a rental and struggling to pay our bills each month.  
My husband thinks his job is beneath him and is very resentful of his co-workers that make more than him.  He comes home from work very upset and complains about his day for 30/60 minutes.  The children leave because they don't want to hear it and then he complains about them leaving. 
Through this all I have never complained about money.  I buy everything second hand, I have sold everything and anything I have ever had that had value.  I have put all my effort into giving our kids a great childhood(they are both awesome kids and are top of their class, and they don't complain about going without).
It has been 10 years since my husband lost his job and he still has not gotten over it.  He drinks way too much(everyday from 6 pm till he passes out 12-2am, on the weekends he starts earlier), he is basically a barely functional alcoholic.  He is depressed and angry most of the time, but I still try.   I had had a long day too.  At some point he accused me of blaming him for our situation and not caring about his well being.
I snapped and just left and went to bed in our daughters room.
So finally here is my question.  How do you help someone see that they are their own worst problem.  Sometimes my husband talks about going to talk with someone bit then tells me he is too,smart,for therapy.",relationship_advice

t3_chfo09,My [25M] friend [21F] of 4 years ghosted me a week before our planned outdoor activity. She then did the same activity on the same day with someone [19M] else. I'm still being ghosted.,"Hola,

I'll keep it short unless y'all want more context. I met this girl in my first year of university. I started university late because I wanted to save up first, which explains the age difference. We had classes together for the entire first year. She was really smart and we clicked well. We don't really hang out outside of campus, but on campus it depends on our schedules for that semester.

In January, she said she was going back to her home country on the other side of the world for her master's program, so I made more of an effort to hangout out outside of campus. Most of time she would say she's busy but we went out for lunch a couple days after Valentine's Day. We had so much catching up to do but she spent most of the time talking about her new date. I would be lying if I didn't say I felt like a therapist. I say the most notable part of that was the fact that she said that he seems jealous that she's spending time around me instead of him, and was asking who I am.

After that we only went out for lunch once more before the semester ended in mid-April. We made a bucket list of things we wanted to do in her last 3 months here. She said she wasn't in a rush so we didn't plan on doing any of them until June and July. In the meantime I went to her birthday and grad, and she kept nagging me to come visit her and that she'll be my tour guide. I work part time at an airlines so I get free first class and discount on hotels. 

In mid-June I reminded her of our bucket list. We agreed to do something on July 1 (we already agreed to do something on July 1 months ago but we're just re-agreeing), but she said she has anxiety because her dad doesn't like her hanging out with guys.

Anyways, a few days before July 1 she stops replying. She'll see my message but don't reply. Turns out on July 1 she does the same thing we're were gunna do but with that other guy. I saw on her IG story (with the green circle). I sent something sarcastic like ""Thanks for letting me know you're free, you're welcome for the bucket list."" She saw it and didn't reply. I felt kinda annoyed and ranted for like half a phone page of why that's not cool. She didn't see it, or probably saw it on her lockscreen and didn't want to reply.

I still see her posting IG stories to her ""Close Friends List"" doing the things we planned. I decided to go complete my bucket list with my other friends. Not sure if it matters, but typically she would only view 1 story and skip the rest, but recently has been watching everything I post. I didn't text her again until a few days ago, about something unrelated and later asked when she's leaving, but again, not seen and not replied to.

I dunno what happened, and it kinda sucks. Sad part is that I was gunna surprise her on July 1 that I was gunna come visit, but I since changed my plans to be a multi-city road trip instead.

So Reddit, what should I do? I kinda wanna ask if she's mad or something but I dunno.",relationship_advice
t3_chjdg7,I feel very excluded from my BF [M 28]s friend group and I can't seem to stop feel shitty about it,"BF and I [F 29] started dating about a year ago; lived together around 5 months now. Just signed a new lease and honestly been talking the full marriage, kids thing etc. We've been treating this like the real deal. Both of us are newer to a city (this becomes more important). In the first few months he met 15ish friends , probably 30+ coworkers of mine. I've met one friend and 2 coworkers of his the entire YEAR. At first I chalked it up to him not having many friends, and when we chatted about it that's always how he phrased it... being new to a city and more of an introvert. 

Lately though - he has a new set of co-workers he is really close to - I'm talking about texting/snapping daily and hanging out with on days off regularly. I was super excited and supportive - but now it crushes me because I'm so secluded from them and have STILL never met them. It's starting to really eat at me because I always wanted him to know my friends, show him off and more importantly lay a foundation for a good partnership of trust/inclusion. I feel like he doesn't want the same, and I feel intentionally cut off. Long story short this is fueling  irrational jealousy (which I've never had in a partnership) and it's the worst emotional rollercoaster EVER. I have absolutely no tools to keep that feeling in check.

We've talked about it (several times) and he has agreed I should be more included and will start inviting folks over etc but nothing has happened yet. Without meeting them - I don't know (1) how to mitigate my feels of jealousy , and (2) how to get past this.",relationship_advice

I expressed I needed more communication but it still hasn’t gotten better. We’re seeing each other this weekend and a friend strongly suggested that I not sleep with him so he would have “motivation” to better communicate...apparently “I gave him what he wanted” too early and that’s why he’s not calling.

t3_chh0hq,I [F22] am having serious doubts about my relationship with my boyfriend [M24] and I feel like major boundaries have been crossed. Would you be worried if this was your boyfriend?,"This morning I woke up to the sweetest good morning text a girl could ask for. I had an anxiety attack yesterday and he sent plenty of hearts and was making sure I was feeling better today. I responded promptly and also asked him how work is going. He opened the message immediately and then went offline. He’s done this before and I hate it, but I busy myself with something else and think not a lot about it. 4 HOURS pass by and the whole time he’s going on and offline. So obviously he’s not busy with something. I then get that message 4 hours later and he sends me a picture of some place out in the wilderness. He said he went on a spontaneous holiday  to the alps with “2 friends”. I have no idea what country he’s in, who he’s with, how long he’ll be gone, anything... So I say to him that I hope he has a good time. He just reads it and ignores again. Then I send him another message to ask him how everything’s going a few hours later, and it doesn’t even go through. He doesn’t have cell service and he didn’t take it upon himself to give me any kind of warning. Now I don’t know how to plan my weekend (because it’s usually assumed that we hang out each week, but I don’t even know how long he’ll be gone?!). Also I don’t like how vague he was about who he’s with. I always make a point to tell him when I travel with friends, to tell him who exactly is going with me and where. I see it as common courtesy. Basically the whole day has been an anxiety attack and I got totally drunk with my friends to get my mind off of it and came home crying alone in my bed. 

Also let me start this off to say that I have my reasons already for doubt. 

My boyfriend of 6 months has two female friends that he contacts regularly on Snapchat since the beginning of our relationship. He has still never told me about them. In the beginning of the relationship, I noticed this. But I decided it was not my place to ask about them since they’re probably just good friends of his that he’s known longer. Why should I get in between that if I’ve only been with him for a month? I let that go, but I still remember and notice it. 

He leaves me on “read” for hours at a time. I find it extremely inconsiderate and disrespectful. We only see each other weekends, so our relationship on the days in between kind of relies on texting to communicate.  When it happens I feel very hurt and like he has no regard for my time/feelings. But this is also something I decided was not my battle to fight, and brushed it off as a “quirk”. 

He follows and continues (sometimes) to follow Instagram models... enough said about that.

He has withheld information from me in the past as to “not upset me”. It wasn’t a big deal, but I remember it as a moment of complete dishonesty. He had already decided the night before that he wouldn’t be staying the whole weekend.. but thought he should just drop it on me in the afternoon that he was leaving that very evening. I have an anxiety disorder (which he knows), so that just put a lot of stress on me with the change of plans. I would have been fine had he given me a few more hours/days notice.

He’s on his phone quite a lot when we’re together. So it makes me wonder why he takes so long all the time to answer me.

Am I crazy or am I just gaslighting myself?! Would you be worried if this was you?

t3_chcm74,Ex-friend (28f) contacts me (27f) after a year of no contact,"Not a throwaway, I'm just new. (First post yay!)

&amp;#x200B;

This is a doozy (tl;dr at the bottom). English is not my first language so I apologize for grammatical errors. I'm trying.

&amp;#x200B;

During high school (and even college) I had a friend who would constantly piss people off by violating their privacy, She shared secrets, personal pictures, etc. Even if she wasn't told anything, she would go out of her way to find out everyone's business. When she was caught, confronted, and ostracized, she would whine and complain about how everything was unfair to her and how her terrible childhood kept her from being a decent person. A couple weeks later she'd try to convince everyone that she was ""a new person now"" and that she ""grew up"" while avoiding apologizing for being shitty in the first place. I lost count of how many times this happened.

After high school she didn't go to college. Didn't work. Didn't have very many friends. She blamed her parents and her siblings for her unhappiness. I'm a masochist (and I felt bad for her) so I tried to be there for her when she wanted to talk to someone.

Last year, she was accused of rape. The scenario that was described to me (by the victim) was so graphic and horrifying that I urged them to call the police immediately (which they eventually decided against). I blocked her on all social media and cut contact. By this time we had not spoken for three months and my thought process was that even if she was innocent, the fact that I whole-heartedly believed that she would hurt someone like that proves that I could never be a good friend to her.

She freaked out immediately. Called me, texted me, emailed me, even texted *my mom*. She then went to my closest friends and tried convincing them to dump me. She said I was ""pathetic"" and ""so high school"" and that I was probably fucking someone who didn't like her and that's why I wasn't talking to her (I was not, for the record). She called me a slut and suggest my closest friends should stop ""dealing with \[me\]"". Luckily no one took her bait and I moved countries (partially because she was freaking me out) soon after.

Fast-forward to yesterday. I got a message request on an instagram account I had made last week for aesthetic purposes. It was from her. She congratulated me on my wedding, said she was sad about my dog who had died a few weeks ago, and proceeded to like all of my posts.

I don't know how to respond. I'm pissed she mentioned my dog and I don't know why. I don't know if I should just block her or if I should cuss her out or if I should write a firm response about not wanting any contact.

t3_chddj1,My parents make me (21 F) feel fat since I came back from my exchange,"I have to say that I gained a bit of weight during my year abroad: delicious food, a lot of alcohol etc etc. that’s why I came back with 10 pounds more. I’m 5’6 and now I am 128 lbs. When I left I was 115 lbs and I had a really nice body but I struggled a lot to achieve that during my teenage years, always fighting with diets and low self esteem.

I didn’t really feel ‘fat’ but I noticed weighing more because some pants weren’t fitting anymore. By the way nobody there made a comment about my body and I was feeling great .
The day I came back my parents made some comments about my shape and then I made the error of telling my mother I wanted to do a diet to lose these pounds.... from that moment she started asking me 20 times a day what I should eat and making comments about what I could/could not eat. 
(And btw she’s not even so skinny so I don’t get why she thinks is so important for me to be thin).

Another day she commented how now she preferred to see me with ‘longer’ dresses and not with shorts/mini skirts. Even if she didn’t say it explicitly I understood that my ‘new’ weight isn’t appropriated for this kind of clothes. (I don’t care about it at all and keep dressing how I like).

Then we went on vacation all together to the mountains. I had a good breakfast and I didn’t feel too hungry at lunch so I didn’t order anything, my sister told me it wasn’t really a nice idea since we went trekking and my father replied ‘actually it’s not so bad if you skip lunch sometimes’. Like, really? Isn’t all this reaction to 10 pounds a bit too much?

Then at 8.00 I was obviously really hungry and while my parents ordered an appetizer and another dish I suggested to my sister to share an appetizer before the grilled chicken I ordered.
She told me she was way too hungry to share it (ham&amp; cheese) since we went trekking the whole day and suggested me to take one just for me. I was thinking about it since I know cheese is quite caloric when my father told me ‘Are you serious? The cheese? It’s like a billion calories!’.


So I felt like I was a 1000 lbs and I closed the menu. I barely ended the chicken because I lost all my appetite but now I realize it’s just mean and annoying to act this way. I mean, I go to the gym 3 times a week (even if they say maybe it’s not enough) and I eat healthy, I feel like their behavior is really bad and triggering since I already struggled with accepting my body and became too skinny when I was 17... I feel like it’s out of line but I don’t know if I’m being too sensitive and they’re just doing it for me.
What do you think? Should I just brush these things off or tell them to stay out of my diet/weight problems?",relationship_advice
t3_chj914,My bf is jealous of a gay guy,"(I am 21F and BF is 26M, we’ve been together since April)
Me and my bf have been together for a while now and I’ve never really had friends during that time. I’m not a very social person so not talking to anyone other than my SO and family for big chunks of time is normal for me.
Yesterday however I decided to go back into a discord server with people I’ve known for multiple years. I would consider some of them to be really good friends of mine.
So soon after I join one of them says he’s on lunch break and can talk for 15 minutes. I said that would be great and I jumped straight into voice chat with him.
Now about 5 minutes into our conversation my bf texts me and because I don’t want to be rude and just ignore my friend every time my phone vibrates it takes me a few minutes to respond to the text.
Bf asks “what are you doing right now?” so I tell him I’m catching up with old friends. He proceeds to go absolutely ballistic and blow my phone up with texts telling me how suspicious it is that I suddenly have people other than him to talk to and that he should be my first priority at all times.
I try to explain to him that I just want to talk to a friend but he is still mad that I took so long to answer.
I also tell him that the the guy I’m talking to is gay and there is nothing happening ever but he still thinks that I’m being “suspicious”.

Now I can understand where he is coming from because he was pretty serious with his last gf and she cheated on him multiple times during their relationship. It really destroyed him and he actually told me that after that he will never trust a girl like that again.

I think it’s a horrible thing that happened to him and so far I have tried to be as understanding and considerate as possible towards him because of that. 
However the fact that I apparently can’t talk to anyone without having to drop everything for him if my phone buzzes really bothers me. 
I actually thought he’d be happy for me because I try to connect with people I like but now I fear that he’ll make me cut all contact with them again. (All 3 of the people  I’m close to on the internet are gay guys so I double don’t understand his concern)

What can I do to make him trust me? How can I spend time with my friends without him getting possessive?

t3_chgyke,BFF (30/F) occupying too much of my (30/F) mind space," 

Hi,

I am writing this for two reasons-

One- possibly request some help and/or advice,

Two- to get this out of my system.

Here goes:

I (30/Female) used to be BFFs with a girl in college. We were quite close and had a very strong connection. We stayed in touch on and off after college, I cut her out a few years after college ended thinking that she was quite busy in her life as she didn’t show any interest in staying in touch.

Soon after I got married to a lovely guy. The first two years of the marriage were quite rough with me adjusting to a new lifestyle in a new city far away from home, and I didn’t get any moment to think about or talk to my BFF.

After about two years of marriage, I got things in order in my life. I started to miss her from the depths of my heart. I sent her an email to which she responded and thankfully expressed her happiness to have heard from me. I tried to rekindle the friendship and sort of succeeded to pick things up where we left. She told me she doesn’t have any other friends other than me. With my dear friend back in my life I felt very happy.

**Now, the problems-**

\[1\] Sometimes I feel like I am forcing myself on her - because if I didn’t initiate a conversation, we’d go days without talking to each other. And I don’t feel good about those days. Not that I have any ego issues in messaging/calling her, it’s just that her efforts to strike a conversation or ask about me/my day/life are zero. This makes me feel like she doesn’t feel as strongly about staying in touch as I do. She may probably be quite busy with her life and may still be opening up to me. The only way to get an answer is by asking her but I don’t know how I can ask such a thing without sounding desperate.

\[2\] On the days that we don’t talk or she doesn’t respond to my messages, I feel very sad. It’s so much of a strong feeling I have for her that she is usually the first and the last thought of my day. I have these fantasies about her where we are all close, cuddly and kissing each other all over- this makes me feel guilty like a cheating wife, sometimes makes me doubt my sexual orientation. (I only have dated guys and don’t have any general interest in women). I don’t think this is normal for a straight married lady to feel so strongly about her BFF and it really torments me to not have any answers as to why the emotion is such that it feels like a one-sided love story of a psychopath.

My mind is always distracted thinking about her. I have tried getting busy at work and making new friends but nothing seems to work. What should I do?!

**Thanks!**

TL;DR; : think about and miss my BFF way too much, not sure what to do and how to control it.",relationship_advice

t3_chj8ic,How can I [27F] make my very busy boyfriend’s [35M] life easier and happier?,"My boyfriend owns a business, and there are just plain no days off because there is a lot that needs to be done. Lately, he has not had any money problems, and things with his business are going well, but the progress that he’s seeing is very slow moving. 

He has been in a bit of a rut, he has gotten a lot quieter in general and doesn’t seem interested in some of the things that he used to enjoy more. He just seems not quite like himself and I’m worried that he is a bit depressed.

I, on the other hand, work from home and have a lot of free time. I want to think of things I can do for him that will free up more of his time, not necessarily so we can spend time together, just for his own sake. We don’t live together and usually we can’t get together until after 9PM because that’s when his day wraps up. I have been meal prepping and he pays for half the cost of meals if I just make some for both of us for the week. He tells me that my doing that makes his day a lot easier, and I feel like if I could think of more things to do in some of my free time maybe I could at least help him out of this rut.

(On mobile, not native speaker, yada yada.)

tl;dr - my and my friend both have crush on each other but she's in the long term relationship and we want to remain friends but thins are awkward, I want to die


I have a friend, let's call her Flora. Flora is the best person that I've ever met - warm, caring, smart, you get the idea. She usually doesn't like to talk with others about her problems, but she helped me countless times with mine. I also know her long term partner, Jane. Jane is a pre-op trans woman. For quite some time everything was fine, we played games together with our other friends, occasionally hangout, usual stuff.

But eventually we got closer with Flora, she even opened up a bit, talked more about her life, we started spending more time together. And of course, as an utter idiot, I caught feelings but was trying to suppress them, we're friends after all and she's in a relationship.

The thing is, she isn't exactly happy in her relationship with Jane. I previously assumed that Flora is bi or something and therefore she's okay with her partner going through transition (they started dating when Jane was still appearing as a male and didn't tell Flora about her identity problems at first). 
But the truth is, Flora is really devasted over the whole thing. She loves Jane deeply, but she is also a hetero woman and watching her ""boyfriend"" becoming a girl makes her miserable. And I think this is the reason why she caught feelings too.

Past few weeks something between me and Flora was... different. Some kind of (sexual?) tension, more smiles, more casual hugs, longer talks. 

Aaaaaand then yesterday we both got very drunk skyping each other (we live in a different cities) and I ended up telling her that I like her ""more than I should"" and she responded in the same way. We talked about it for a long time, and came to the following conclusions:

We know that crushes happen sometimes, we don't want to act on it. She has her own relationship to sort out. We still want to be friends but now things are just very awkward between us. I tried to isolate from her in the past to ""get over her"" but it just backfired and I ended up missing her more and more.

We don't know what to do.",relationship_advice
t3_chj5ee,My (20F) BF(22M) seems like a hypocrite?,"So to preface, both me and my Bf have mental illnesses and social problems. Communication can be shoddy at times but we try our best with what we have. And we are both well aware that the way we communicate isn’t healthy but we are trying to work on that. 

The thing is that he kind of expect me to go to him when I have panic attacks or breakdowns (which unfortunately happen a lot). And he get upset if I don’t tell them or wait till later to tell them, but tonight I was having a rough time and actually reached out, told him what was going on with my living situation and that I didn’t want to piss the people who house me off and get kicked out but that their rules were kind of suffocating. And they immediately wanted to go off on the people who house me (let me be real, it’s my damn parents) even though it could result in me being homeless with no where to go. And no matter what I said, he just got matter, our mutual friend said to give him time to understand that he are making a mistake but it really hurts that the consequences don’t matter to him. Our mutual friend picked me up to get me away for a little and he was in the car but he completely ignored my existence and it really hurt.  Especially since he never talks to me when he’s down unless he’s completely lost it and needs a ride somewhere.  And even then it’s bare minimum details and I get snapped at for asking any questions. It’s always “I don’t want to talk about it” or “just stop”. It kind of feels like I’m the one who messed up here or I shouldn’t have told anyone and just dealt with it alone. How do I communicate without setting him off? Or even communicate that what he’s doing hurts?",relationship_advice
t3_chfdjw,I [29F] don’t know what to do you keep my boyfriend’s [36M] spirits high after he lost his job,"My boyfriend lost his IT job about 4 months ago and so far he’s having a having a hard time finding a new one. He constantly applies to jobs, got a resume writer and takes online courses to keep his technical knowledge up to date. So far it hasn’t done much but get a few interviews that either pass or don’t call him back.

More recently he got passed up for a job he was excited about. After that happened he says he’s really lost and doesn’t know what to do. He seems very defeated and down on himself. It kills me to see him like this because I feel like there’s nothing I can do to make him feel better and make him feel hopeful.

t3_chfd4u,I have a really confusing friendship which is stopping from being able to be in a relationship,"My friend (f, 16) and I (m,17) have been close friends for a while now. We've become way closer then I am to anyone else. Ever since I met her, I was definitely romantically interested in her, but at the time she was in a relationship. Ever since that relationship ended, she's sworn off of relationships in general and is living by the motto ""friendships last longer"". I always respected that and have tried to see her as just a friend. It's getting harder because we keep seemingly getting closer. 

When we meet up, some times we just cuddle and that's all we do the whole time. When we talk, we act very flirty and we talk quite intimately. She's also the person I text or call the most, and it seems like we update eachother on most things as they happen in our lives. Any time we're away from each other for a long time we quite openly admit that we miss eachother a lot or we wish the other one was there. At one point I was just feeling confused about where I stand with her, and we talked about possible romantic feeling toward each other. She admitted she felt the same way back, even saying that she loved me, but she just doesn't want a relationship. 

Now before being in this situation, I wanted to be in a relationship in general. I just kinda missed having someone to be close to and to go on dates with and stuff. Now that this has all happened, I feel attached to my friend and I don't really want to be with someone else. Even if I manage to get over this, I'd hurt her by pursuing anyone else. I sometimes notice how she gets a little jealous when I talk to other girls. 

For a bit I was just convincing myself that I need to give her time, but I realise that might be a distorted way to look at that and may just leave me hoping for something that's never gonna happen. 

Now, I just don't know what's a good idea to do.",relationship_advice
t3_chj4e9,I [24M] feel I am not ready to get engaged next year despite telling my SO [24F] that I would,"A part of me has always wanted what she wants (to be engaged at that time) but another side of me was always a little more cautious and nervous about that idea. It still made me a little uncomfortable. My gf has a tendency to not take opposing views very well (she told me she thought I was the one she wanted to marry ~1 month into our 3 year relationship and when I didn’t reciprocate that right away she got upset and emotional) so I would rarely if ever express my doubts and only expressed the feelings I had that aligned with hers.

I am trying to put an end to that by being more honest with her and telling her I think (note “think”, not “know”) that I will need more time before we get engaged. More time would mean something like another year. She feels betrayed and thinks I’ve been lying to her about my feelings this whole time and she is partially right but it’s more that I just wasn’t being fully honest about my doubts. 

I’ve tried bringing up to her that a lot of the reason I was afraid to bring up my doubts stems from the fact that it never feels like my opinions/views/doubts/etc matter to her. She just seems to listen to them and react in whatever way that affects her emotionally whereas whenever she tells me similar things I try to at least put my initial feelings aside and listen to her and try to understand. I do that because I want her to feel listened to and cared for and I know that I can always express my feelings after she has had the chance to express hers. I also do it so she always feels like she can tell me anything without fear of a large backlash. I feel the opposite currently. I am constantly afraid of a large emotional response, putting the blame back on me, or other poor responses to what I am saying to the point where I don’t feel like I can say what I want. It doesn’t even feel like she cares about my feelings *for me*; it feels like she cares about them *for her.* 

It’s like that saying “you can’t control your feelings but you can control your reactions.” I’ve tried telling her that I would like her to do the same for me but she always takes it like I am asking her to conceal her feelings or bottle them up. Am I being unfair in asking her to listen to what I have to say and hear my out from my point of view before immediately responding emotionally? By doing that, she has made me feel trapped mentally.

t3_chj3mz,"I(29F) dunno what to call my relationship with (M30) partner, is it one?","I have been struggling for years with my boyfriend/fiancée working together on things as a couple. Just him and I worrying about how to manage financially, healthily, and intimately. We’ve been together for. 1 years now, and have a 3 year old.  I often struggle with my anxiety and major depression/persistent depression. However me changing myself for the best of myself and our trio I’ve been achieving I’ve been seeking help from therapy and whatever and can manage somewhat better, unfortunately when I ask the same of my guy, hen says don’t worry about his health and here we are again I. The hospital when we don’t need to be. There’s been a lot of struggle with confirming with him that we are going to work together on things to try and make our lives better, this time because we’ve fallen so many times I told him I would lead on planning and handling things, however, he isn’t letting me do that and is instead making his own arrangement for our lives with outside sources, his mother, a co-worker etc. without letting me in on what is going to happen. I feel like maybe a bit has been bottling up and I finally had enough. In my mind I’ve struggled so much with trying to work things out with him, we are in a never ending circle, and expressing myself to him, he just doesn’t listen to it, but when I ask him how he feels with us and how we are he always says for the last 9 years that “it’s hard to put I to words” and it’s left as that.  I feel like I need space from him ? I don’t even know if I’m still in love with him as I was, at this point it feels like we are just friends living in the same apt with a child we had together. In the long run when people talked down about hi. I always stood up for him and said they were wrong, because i felt like he was better than that, but regardless he also never stood up for me, he would just stand back and let me take drama or trouble.  I try so hard to look out for him an stress about his well being. It he just tells me not to worry about it. We are supposed to be in this as a team TOGETHER shouldn’t be my job to worry about him? This is my first and only real relationship too and I’m stuck in a spiral about how to feel about myself and him.  I try and encourage him to use any means of talking if he can’t find the right words verbally, but it’s still not helping. When we first had a possible break up argument, he said if he lost me he would kill himself because there was no point In Carrying on if it wasn’t with me.  I told him that I didn’t want to lose him as a friend because he is my only best friend I have, and it would hurt to lose him that way.  I’ e never been independent too so it would be a whole new world to me, but I don’t know if having time apart will make things better? It’s a struggle because I’m not only worried about me, I’m worried about my child too, but I can’t just stay in One place if I am unhappy.

t3_chgrqg,"my boyfriend called me disgusting and told me he hates me, not sure what to do next","!very long post lol, tl;dr at the bottom!

i’m going to start with some background on the situation before i get into the main event 

i have known my boyfriend for a year and a half now. we started dating officially in august of 2018, and have broken up twice since then. once for a few days in february, and once for a few days at the beginning of this month

the reason for the breakups was due to stress, he was the one who broke up with me both times. we have had a hard time being together due to his living situation, and it’s put a huge strain on our relationship. we’ve gotten back together both times because we love each other, and are determined to make things work

anyway, when we got back together in february i found out that he had been lying to me about his interactions with other girls since the day i met him 

he went to high school with a girl, we’ll call her L, and he told me last year multiple times that he hadn’t talked to her since he left high school 3 years ago. 

turns out, he was messaging her the entire time i knew him (from AT LEAST april-august of 2018) also found out that when he was in high school, they apparently “sexted” once, and she was into him for a while but he never returned the feelings

it’s a complicated situation because apparently she was begging for attention from him last year and would threaten suicide, self harm, and just make a lot of self depricating comments if he didn’t give her the attention she wanted. this happened with another girl, A, as well. i read through a majority of the conversations and understood why he felt the need to keep talking to these girls, but some of the things he said to them still hurts me. also, L and A both live in california while my boyfriend and i live on the east coast. 

still, he would compliment them, talked about meeting up with L once even though he swears he didn’t want to and only talked about it because she wanted to, and just being overly friendly in general because he was afraid of the repercussions if he wasn’t 

he had lied to me for an entire year about both of these girls, and i found out that after he broke up with me in february he had immediately messaged L again after not speaking to her since august

this didn’t make sense to me because he told me he didn’t want to talk to her and only felt obligated to speak to her and reply to her messages last year, he talked about how he would ignore her for days and constantly try to stop talking to her but she never got the hint.

he told me he messaged her when we broke up because he tried talking to his friends and his family to make himself feel better, and he thought that maybe talking to someone who didn’t really know me directly would distract him from how much he was hurting. (i became very close with his friends and family and entire social circle on the east coast) he mentioned that it wasn’t about talking to her specifically, she was just the first person he saw on his snapchat that wasn’t directly involved in out relationship and messaged her 

when he broke up with me in february, he refollowed her main account and private nsfw account on instagram, and obviously started talking to her on snapchat again. i looked through their messages on snapchat and didn’t see anything that made me too upset, just her being a little overly friendly and him just making surface level conversation 

when he broke up with me in july, i was worried that the same thing was going to happen. i was reassured when he showed me he wasn’t friends with either of the girls on snapchat anymore, and he removed both of them from his instagram months ago

today i saw something that made me think he wasn’t telling the truth, i saw a picture of him shirtless and smiling saved in his snapchat camera roll from the day after we broke up (he would send me pictures of himself like this when we first met when he was having self esteem issues, things like that)

i asked him what that was about, he told me he was feeling alone and ugly and took the picture because it made him feel better about himself, he also told me he didn’t send it to anyone 

i told him i didn’t believe him, i told him i was afraid because he’s lied to me about things like that before, he’s very good at hiding things and kind of forcing me to trust him 

after telling him how afraid i was and how i didn’t know if he was really telling the truth or not, he yelled at me, called me disgusting, told me he hated me, and stormed out. he’s also called me multiple other horrible names within the past month, even after i’ve begged him to stop

i’m not sure where to go from here, i blindly trusted every word he said from the day i met him until the day he first broke up with me, and it was a huge mistake because of the amount of lies he was telling me

he told me he’s changed and grown up as a person and doesn’t lie anymore and doesn’t have anything to hide, yet he said the same exact thing in february when i found out he was messaging L 

i know i can’t completely trust what he’s telling me now, all signs point to the fact that he was sending pictures of himself to other girls last year and while we were broken up, but he tells me different and swears he’s telling me the truth. his reaction to all of this scares me the most, he’s been very defensive and angry but he tells me he’s just upset that i don’t trust him 

i’m feeling very lost, i want things to work out but i’m very afraid of getting hurt again, any advice on where to go from here would be very appreciated :)

p.s.: everything i saw on his phone was done with consent, we looked through his snapchat together and his pictures together, and he showed me all of the messages that were saved between the two girls he was talking to last year because he wanted to be transparent with me

tl;dr: tell my boyfriend i’m afraid of trusting him after all of the lies he’s told me in the past, he calls me disgusting, tells me he hates me, and storms out. feeling very lost and unsure of what to do next",relationship_advice

t3_chobyd,I want to date my fathers wife. What if I really want to be with her? should I try something with her in secrete? she has feelings for me too?,"Throwaway for privacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I really lover her, like really. She also seems to like me. She doesn't like my father. So, maybe its fine to date in secrete?

&amp;#x200B;

\`\` info:

\-me and her dated 2 years ago, we basically were lovers and used to have sex while sex without marriage is not permitted in our country

\-she dumped me after i stupidly texted other girls and went on date

\-I found out 4 months ago that she will be marrying my father

\-she married my father 2 months ago.

\-me, her, my two siblings and my father live in one house

So, I couldn't help it. I needed to ask her this three questions:

\-why did she marry him?

\-does she have feelings for him?

\-does she still have feelings for me?

I love her, I have loved her for the past 2 years.

I wasn't expecting her to answer, I thought she will get mad at me or something. She was calm, she told me everything. Her father got ill, he is suffering from cancer, I already knew that my father told me but she has 1 older brother and 2 younger sister (12-15). Her mother died years ago.

The house that they used to live in belonged to their uncle and he kicked them out. Her brother was abroad studying and he needed money. He is such a bastard, he doesn't give a damn about them.

So, anyways, Basically they needed money. so, she sacrificed herself, she says \`\`my father will die \`\`and she wants to help her sisters. She got a lot of money from my father, the groom pays money or gives a gift to the bride and she asked for 450k (in dollar). He also bought them a house for like 160-200k.

Now, I get all the story.

Then she went on and said that she doesnt like him. I also asked her how she met him and she said that he saw her once 5 years ago and asked about her by her father. Like TF? I never knew that. She said that she didn't tell me when we were dating because she found it weird.  Then months ago, They met again in hospital, he visited her father but properly he wanted to trap her into his scheme.

Anyways, she got a lot of things off of her chest and then we started talking about the past and how we were and we got a bit emotional and she kissed me and she ended up feeling so bad.

It wasn't just a kiss though, we basically almost fucked each other? it was as if we were waiting for this. I knew we will end up this way, we were always like magnets  to each other.

I am an asshole, but I don't feel bad towards my father and honestly I don't care, why would he marry a 17 year old?

I wanted to get it off of my chest. But what do you guys think? how can I help her? I feel so bad for her right now.\`\`

t3_chgqk3,Relationships and Facebook.,"Will keep short and sorry for format on phone. More so after opinions on both sides if possible.

Boyfriend (22) and me (23) are in a fairly new relationship. We’ve got our relationship status as together on Facebook. 

However in terms of photos, we have none of us.  Which I didn’t think was an issue, but for him it’s a really big issue and I’m struggling to understand why. 

We’re both very private people. He doesn’t use his actual first name on Facebook due to family issues, and I don’t use my actual last name on Facebook due to what I do for work. (Workers are to remain neutral on political decisions etc). 

We both don’t post about our personal lives on Facebook, he shares gaming related content. I share gaming content, news article, occasionally I’ll rant about people in the city. 

The last photo I uploaded to my FB was 4 months ago when I changed my profile picture, prior to that my last photo was over a year old. Don’t post selfies (I post more photos of my cat than of anything else). 

Before we became a couple we talked about pet peeves from our ex’s, and one thing he ranted a lot about was photo taking, his ex would apparently insist on taking a photo of them together almost every day and had to take one before they went out, and that he hated it. 

But now he feels that I’m ashamed to be with him. Which definitely isn’t the case. I said I’d more than happily take photos with him and he can upload them to his Facebook. But now he doesn’t want to because he feels I’m only doing it to make him happy. 

I can sort of see where he is coming from, but at the same time it’s not a big deal for me, I don’t share my personal life on Facebook, so I thought it’d be a given that I wouldn’t really flaunt our relationship.",relationship_advice

But it started going downhill after that but Maria has yet to notice.  We would all go to parties together and there would be times that Luke would come talk to me, my sister and my boyfriend and would say things like ""I think I need to break up with her"" or ""I don't know how much longer I can do this"" and would text people saying the same thing and 2 minutes later would say ""nevermind"" which should have been the first red flag.  We never told my sister what he said because we didn't believe it was any of our business to possibly screw up their relationship. Luke has started disrespecting our family, including our mom, our other sister Jane, and has lied about me to avoid himself getting in trouble with our parents. Luke refuses to come over to our house to apologize to anybody and is not allowed back into the house until he does (my moms rule). It has been 3 weeks since he has had the chance to do so.  Our mom and dad argue about Luke almost every night and it has started to cause a lot of problems within our family. Luke has been breaking all of their rules and disrespecting them in every manner. Maria claims he does this because ""he loves me"" which still doesn't make since. My boyfriend loves me but he's not going around calling family members names and disrespecting our family. Alot of Maria's friends have noticed she has changed as a person, and not in a good way. Our whole family has noticed a change in her as well, and their relationship has been tearing out family apart.  We want to talk to her about it but do now know the best way to approach it.  She doesn't see all the problems he's been causing.  Their relationship has started to make Maria become more distant from her own family and a majority of her friends.

t3_chd1pa,How do I(f28) handle my live-in helper(f29) refusal to listen?,"Prior to hiring my live-in helper, she understood that she will be sleeping in the same room as my grandmother.  After 5 months, my helper mentioned that she’ll sleep in the bomb shelter-turned-storeroom (which can only fit a single sized bed with no walking space). I’ve put a lot of heavy items in the storeroom such as luggage, spare toiletries, small machinery, etc..

The room is stuffy due to having just one small air opening and a thick 1.7 tonnes blast-proof steel door(it is after-all, a bomb shelter). I personally feel it’s dangerous with all the heavy items stacked up to the ceiling. We agreed that she has to keep the steel door open, while I fashioned a door out of tension rod and ceiling-to-floor cloth. (For legal purposes, I cannot build a thinner door or add additional windows)

However, for the past 2 nights, she kept the steel door shut tight. I am worried as it is dangerous yet understand that she doesn’t share the same fear as me. I also understand that she likes the privacy the bomb shelter offer. 

How do I get her to understand or at least respect that I’m the employer and she is going against me? I am afraid that this “not doing things that I instructed her to do” could become a problem in the future. 

I also understand I have to provide her adequate accommodation, but I only have these few rooms available. I can probably clear out the bomb shelter, but I still think that closing the steel door is not helpful for air ventilation.

t3_chj0k0,Too soon to ask where this is going?,"Hellloo,

I’m a 24 year old male and met a girl on tinder a little over two weeks ago, but unfortunately as I was getting into town, she was leaving town. So we never actually got the chance to meet in person. However, we continued to talk and have been talking/texting/snapping pretty much every day and night since our first conversation. 

We have quite a bit in common, a similar sense of humor, and our personalities are also really similar which is a good thing. We’ve also gotten intimate a few times (as intimate as you can be with pictures and a voice). The thing is, while sometimes I get vibes that tell me she wants more than simply a person to talk to, other times it feels like this is going to be the extent of our relationship. She lives a few hours away and while we both expressed interest in wanting to meet, i get the feeling that I’m much more into the idea than she is. 

Essentially my question is, after two weeks, is it too soon to ask if this has the potential to go anywhere besides phone calls and texts? If it’s too soon to even be thinking about that, then I’d hate to bring it up and seem like a jackass, but I also don’t want to waste my time vibing with someone that has no intention of ever progressing any further.

t3_chf76i,My Fiance (24M) called the police on me (22F),"**TL;DR:** I locked my fiance out in the garden because he was smoking weed instead of helping me around the house for 20 minutes, he called the police and now social services are investigating us. He doesn't think he did anything wrong and doesn't regret it.

First of all, long time lurker &amp; obvcious throwaway.

To give you a bit of background around the circumstances here: I am currently 7 months pregnant with my first child with my Fiance. We have been together for about a year and a half. I am from the UK and he is from Brazil. We both live in the UK, **he lived here for 3+ years before he met me.**

From the start, his mum has been very jealous of me and overprotective of him. He grew up without a dad, his brothers dad also left his mum so she pretty much raised these boys by herself. Before he met me, they would talk on FaceTime **2 or 3 times every day**. Since he met me and especially since we have moved in together he speaks to her once a day. In my opinion that is still a little strange but that's ok. **She has blamed me on him not speaking to her as much**, she rings him and messages him constantly and if he doesn't answer or reply she gets very upset. She has constantly told me I should cook more, clean more, she is a 'women of the house' as they say and I have made it very clear I am not. I have a full-time career which I won't be giving up. She did all the cooking, cleaning, laundry for him &amp; he only learnt how to do it when he moved here alone at 20 years old. He tried to move here over here twice so she could work while he studies and they rented one bedroom to share ***(?)*** so I'm guessing he thought when he got engaged I would start to be a housewife which hasn't happened.

**My fiance is addicted to smoking weed**, he has been smoking every day for 10 years (since he was 14) and does not show signs of stopping. He is both physically &amp; mentally addicted. His mum begged me to get him help, but every time I try to bring it up he fights with me. I tell her what he says and she blames it on me because I started the fight ***(?)***

We went to Brazil and I met his family for the first time a few months ago, I can speak very very little Portuguese - I don't mean to be ignorant and yes I could learn to speak better but I work full time and I have tried but it's such a hard language to speak when you're learning from English! He says when we got together I accepted his language &amp; his culture so I should learn. We were there for nearly 3 weeks and I felt very isolated as he was the only person I could actually speak to. He said that was my problem and I should have learnt before. This is the first time he had been back to Brazil in nearly 4 years as he hadn't been back since he came to the UK, instead of saving up for plane tickets he spent all his money on smoking weed and travelling to Ibiza &amp; Amsterdam. **I spent over £1,300 on tickets for a trip I cried throughout because he excluded me and shouted at me in front of his family. It worked to his advantage as none of them could speak English so they didn't know the circumstances of the fight, they thought I was being 'hormonal'.** This meant that he had a lot of catching up to do, which I was expecting but at the time I was 3 months pregnant and he was carting me all over Brazil for hours in the car to stay at lots of different relatives houses. Before we went I had to put my foot down and said that for a week on the trip I would like to have my own space and rent an AirBnB, he was reluctant and then asked me if his mum could stay with us too? I had to shoot that idea down as obviously the whole reason to rent an apartment was for space. She was so upset with me. Said I was keeping her from her son.

When he told his family of our plans, they told us that we were stuck up and he said it was my idea. His mum was upset that she couldn't sleep in our apartment. It was all very strange. Whilst we were there, I gently let her know *(with the help of Google translate as my fiance said that this was my business and he didn't agree with my opinion as that's 'his culture')* that I really wanted her to visit the UK when our baby is born however I do not want her to stay with us for a month as I would find it uncomfortable and it's not really how I envisioned having my first child, in a small one bedroom apartment with his mother sleeping on the sofa. She can't speak a word of English which I don't have a problem with but the thought of having to look after my first born whilst trying to translate stresses me out! Also I think he wants her to stay to help me with the cooking, cleaning etc but I have told him that's his job and he can't pass it on to his mother? When I told her this, she started to cry. She then calmed down, and said she respected my point of view. Then she messaged me a few weeks ago to say I had 'no right to forbid her from seeing her grandchild' and got insulted when I told her that I was not, however I think it's best if she stays with some friends while visiting. **She is now not going to come at all because she can't stay with us.** He agrees with her and says what I'm doing is wrong.

We have been fighting, a lot, and instead of telling my family how he has been making me feel when he shouts at me or says horrible things to me I tried to speak to his mum as she is the only person he seems to respect. She just excuses his behaviour, in Brazil she saw him shouting at me 3 months pregnant reducing me to tears on multiple occasions and all she would say to me is 'you need to stop fighting' ***(?)***. She tells him to just ignore me, I'm pregnant and it's my hormones... no matter what the situation. She has told me I need to stop fighting with him or he will get tired and leave me and I will raise the child as a single mum as she did. Even when he starts the fight, even when he gets violent or aggressive, even when he calls me a whore and a bitch, she tells me I should not fight. She now sends all the messages I send to her in private, to him and tells him that she doesn't want to speak to me anymore.

I am currently 7 months pregnant and I have been doing everything around the house for months even though my body is suffering from severe water retention and high blood pressure. All the laundry, all the packing to move house, all the cooking and all the cleaning.

Anyway, to get on to what happened on Saturday:

We had been shopping for our new apartment (we have to downsize, which is hilarious as I am the main breadwinner and I will be earning peas on maternity leave). We came home and he said he wanted to be by himself outside to smoke, I got a little hurt as the weekends are the only time we spend together as I work days and he works nights (opposite shifts) and I said fine, spend all night outside alone. I went to the bedroom for a couple of hours, watched some YouTube then came back outside and surprise he was smoking weed and watching YouTube again. I said to him come on... you need to do something other than this we are moving in a week! He told me to leave him alone, and started to ignore me. I picked up the broom and was tapping him on the leg with it saying please just sweep the garden, please just sweep the garden... he was saying don't touch me, don't touch me! Took his engagement ring off and threw it into the forest next to our house saying I make his life hell and he was happier before he met me. And I said ok fine, you can't come back in until you sweep the garden.

I locked the back door, went back to bed &amp; about 15 minutes later he started tapping on the door for me to let him in. He wouldn't even look at me. I went to the door in my underwear, calmly just asked him if I let him back in will he do something to help me around the house? He avoided the question, kept saying let me back in, I kept repeating will you help me around the house? Please note neither of us were shouting, it was a calm situation. He then called the emergency police (999/911) &amp; I let him back in.

He told the operator his full name, my full name, my DOB, our address and that I had locked him out the house for half an hour and he was hungry. He told her I was pregnant &amp; that he wanted to make reports about things like this as it's better to call the police otherwise people just blame men for getting aggressive if something happens? She asked me if I was calm, he said yes, he asked her if I was in the same room as him, he said no, I was lying in bed. She then ended the call by saying that someone would come to check on us.

I left immediately after that call. I told him that he has potentially just started a case on us with Social Services (CPS) which cannot do undone just because he would not help me around the house. I took a walk and got some food and sat in the park to calm down. I messaged his mum telling her what had happened. I told her that he had just called the police on me and possibly jeopardised our daughters life with us. I told her that she should be ashamed of him. She just replied saying that I have to create judgement and she is proud of her son - I did not reply.  She screen shotted the whole conversation and sent it to him.

When I returned a few hours later, I just went straight to the bedroom and cried. It was around 11pm at this point and I was exhausted and shocked about what had just happened. The police then arrived, I was on the phone to my mother the whole time and she was just telling me to breathe. They did not take a report or interview either of us, he told them that he thinks he shouldn't have called them and then they left.

We slept in separate beds, the following night I just sat next to him &amp; cried asking how he could hurt me like that. He told me to leave him alone &amp; wouldn't take his eyes off the TV. I just cried &amp; cried begging him to explain why he would put his pregnant fiance through so much stress? I then called my dad and just cried, I tried to explain the situation but I was so embarrassed that this had happened. My fiance then started shouting at me when I was on the phone to my father. He then started shouting at my father and being rude to him, he threatened him. He told my dad it wasn't unreasonable for him to call the police and he only feels bad because of the baby, not because of me.

My family are obviously very upset - I have had to take leave from work as I have been struggling with perinatal depression for the past few months &amp; the stress from this has sent me over the edge.

Today, I then got a call from the Social Services (CPS). They want to come to my house and meet me. I'm devastated. I have nothing but pure love for my baby and I have done everything I can to keep myself healthy, I have fought tooth &amp; nail to get a suitable house for her and I have already brought her everything she will need. I adore her so much and I would never ever put her in a bad situation.

I told him and he doesn't seem to care, he doesn't think it's a big deal. From what I understand, they don't have CPS in Brazil. He said he has no regrets and I shouldn't have locked him out. His mother is doing nothing.

Please, am I wrong? What have I done to deserve this? I am losing my mind and my heart is so heavy.",relationship_advice
t3_ch90b6,19 hanging out with 30,"I’ve got this cutie with a booty that I’d say I’m dating but not engaged in a relationship. We’ve agreed to be exclusive until we make the leap to relationship level(she just got out of something). We spend every day together for the most part and get along quite well. We do everything that a relationship would (kissing,snuggling, sexual things etc) 

She’s been hanging out with this guy who’s 30 years old and she’s 19. She doesn’t see any problem with this. She sends me snapchats of her wearing his clothes. She’s super secretive about details she know I won’t like, but is honest about them once asked(his age was purposely left out, and didn’t mention where she got clothes from until asked). Is this age gap too much of a age difference(19f,30m) and is wearing other males clothing a red flag? They’ve only known each other a month. 

She’s also going to stay in another town for a week with a different guy that she’s never met in person, only online and they used to like each other years ago(she admitted this). He’s come from another country and they are staying in the same AirBnb for a week in a different city to go clubbing and whatnot. 

Should I be worried?
Do I talk to her about either of those things? She gets extremely defensive about things like this.

t3_chgo4j,"I (M,23) am scared of my housemate’s dog","I (M, 23) just finished college and rented a house in Denver for my new job. I’m not really afraid of dogs before, so I agreed to one of the housemates having his bulldog. When I moved in, I realize that the dog aggressively barks at me (but not everyone else) and I just freeze cause I’m so scared. He bit me once but the scar was small so I didn’t tell anyone. My housemate said the dog is getting some training, but its 2 months already and I have seen no improvement

I have been trying to avoid the dog by cooking really late at night, and I barely go to the kitchen when I hear him barking. But today when he jumps right in front of me and barks when I just got home (my housemate eventually holds him down), I was so scared that I can see myself shaking uncontrollably when I go back to my room. 

I have considered some options (talk to my housemate, but what solution can we come up with?, look at new house, but moving to a new place could be a hassle), but I don’t really know what to do. Pls help me.",relationship_advice
t3_chizqx,Breakups.,"How do you get over a breakup? I love her, and I know she still loves me, she said it herself. She's just not ready for the long-term commitment yet, but the fact that she said that if in a year or so she might be and we might get back together is ripping me apart inside. What should I do?",relationship_advice
t3_chizph,My friend is in an abusive relationship and I'm very concerned,"I [16F] was recently blocked by my friend [16F] because I told her that her boyfriend [17M] is a POS. Earlier she was crying about how she went through his phone and found really explicit text messages with him and some other girl. I told her that she should leave him, she cursed me out and blocked me. Then I proceed to try to get to her via snap, I get blocked again. I know that this whole thing is momentarily though, she'll probably unblock me in a couple days. But him not being loyal has happened on numerous occasions. She cries, he begs her for forgiveness then she takes him back. They've been ""together"" for almost two years and I can't fathom how much I hate this dude.

First of all, he flirted with me when they were both together, KNOWING that we were close friends and when I told her about it, she blamed me and stopped talking to me, saying I'm a liar and ""I want him."" Like no, his a real piece of work. He _lies_ so much. He constantly tries to make me look bad always. Often when our group of friends are going somewhere and he has to come along, he will micro analyze everything I say and try to make her turn against me. I've heard him tell her that she's fat (keep in mind, I believe she has a history of an eating disorder) and he forced her to go on a diet or he'll leave him. Anytime I try to say something that he disagrees with, he will make me seem like the bad guy or just spread lies, like I ""don't want to see her get better"" or some other bull like that. 

Last year, he (unsurprisingly) cheated on her and I was consoling her and she was completely set on breaking up with him. Later that night she miraculously texted me saying that she changed her mind which was odd. The next day in school she came in with a broken nose and a black eye. She was taken aback when I asked her what happened.

I'm so worried for her and I have even told her mother and her sister but they either think I'm bending the truth or they don't care. While at her house I sometimes hear them talking about me in Spanish, and I must tell you that its not very nice. I don't know what the hell to do, honestly. What do I do to make sure that she doesn't get hurt again? I'm so scared for her mental health and overall wellbeing.",relationship_advice
t3_chf3x4,Me(32m) has lots of friends/acquaintances and i feel like I say the same things to lots of people,"So my most common phrase has become something like “perhaps I’ve mentioned before, (thing I was going to say)”

By now everyone knows I’m going to say it so I was just wondering if it’s necessary",relationship_advice
t3_chdtop,My Ex (19 M) wont get the hint that I (F 22) don't want anything to do with him (Obsessive),"In 10th grade (F 17), I was the type that was attractive and fun to be around. But I never got the chance to date anyone because I was too busy doing my own thing to care about being in a relationship. That is, until I met a guy online who went to my school. His name was Levi (M 14). Never even knew this guy existed. He was two grades below me and gave me attention which, at that time, is all I cared about. We started dating and things were going well. Then, three months into the relationship, he opened up about a fetish for using shoes for sexual pleasure. This sexual pleasure was not your basic shoe fetish, it was more of a nasty and revolting kind of fetish.

Being the caring and supportive girlfriend I was, I went along with it. Supporting him and his weird shoe fetish made me very uncomfortable and I didn’t like doing it, period. When I started to refuse, he would go into a rage, calling me names, threatening to dump me, etc. I don't handle yelling very well and often give in, cry, and ask for forgiveness (Your typical door mat). Once he saw how weak I was over just name calling, he took a step forward into making sure I suffered. We communicated on Kik. He would threaten to dump me (sometimes he did), change his username to some other chick’s name, who he was talking to and change his profile picture to said chick. He would often put his username as, “I Love Lisa” or something like that. He would then ignore me for hours. This tore me apart, to the point to where I was crying almost every night. He would lie to his friends and girl friends online, saying that I was being abusive and to have them talk to me. One time, two girls went to talk to me in a group chat, trying to persuade me to stop being abusive and what not. After further discussion, they saw how I did nothing wrong and started to go after him, saying how disrespectful he was being and how he shouldn’t act that way. He never saw what he was doing as wrong and continued to abuse me throughout the entire relationship. 

The abuse went on for 9 months. 9 months of me crying my heart out on a bear he gave me on valentines day. Then, one morning when I woke up, I didn’t feel pain, guilt or remorse. I didn’t love, need, or felt any desire to be with him. He drained all the love I had for him out. I dumped him that day and let me tell you, it felt good. I was happy for the first time in months.

After dumping him, he wanted to be friends. I was okay with it until the fights started. They were over the tiniest things. Talking to him was like a screaming match but without saying anything (On Kik). Once it started to affect my school and home life, I told him I no longer wanted to be friends and just to go our separate ways. I was hoping he’d be understanding and notice that this friendship wasn't going to work. He didn’t understand for some reason. For 4 years, he stalked me. It started when he created 12 different SnapChat accounts just to talk to me. I blocked each single one of them. Then, he had the audacity to send his friends on me, wanting to know why I won’t talk to him. To be honest, his actions during this whole ordeal made me not like him even more. He would not stop trying to call me, text me, send his friends to find me, anything just to be his friend again. The thing is, he mentally abused me so bad that any relationship I get into results in me being so distant and non-trusting. Finding this out made me want absolutely nothing to do with him. 

Just recently, he messaged me and wanted to talk. It was so random because he hasn't talked to me in months.  At this time, he is 19 and I’m 22. (I decided, at this point in my life, I enjoy being alone and not talking to anyone other than my significant other, Lance (M 24).) The tone of my voice over the phone should have been a sign to him I wasn’t interested in talking. He completely ignored that and stated he has changed and is no longer the person he was before. He kept bragging about how much better his life is, almost trying to impress me while my boyfriend is standing right next to the phone. I specifically told him that I wasn’t interested like before and wanted to be left alone. I also stated to him that I don’t talk, hang out, or message any boy other than my boyfriend so if I were to give him a second chance, it would be awkward and uncomfortable. Thought that was the end of it but no!  He’d call me numerous times a week wanting to chat. I got fed up with the whole ordeal to begin with. You can ignore the next paragraph if you want.

I soon sent a very proper message explaining why I didn’t want to be his friend: “It has come to my attention that you don’t understand why it give me great concern that you continue to contact me. Despite the fact I have given you countless clues to sum up the attitude I have towards the situation, you continue to disrupt my life and cause great stress to me and my boyfriend. If only I could grasp the aspect of your ways, may I finally be able to understand why you have tried countless times to contact me. My understanding is (don’t take it the wrong way) you still feel a strong connection to me, being that I was the most attractive partner you’ve had, and you still feel a connection towards me. For myself, I find you to be unappealing, repulsive and a nuisance. Even as a companion/friend, I would not be obliged to be even in the slightest of such. I find that, out of all my significant others I have dated, you have been the only one who has persistently pushed myself into communicating with you. You have multiple dilemmas, dilemmas causing most women to push themselves away from you. You were the first man to cause me to experience “Mental Abuse”. I have romantically been with me who I can no trust and feel they will cause harm to me again and again. My boyfriend, Lance, has seen the wall I put up. I am a very vigilant individual and am constantly watching his every move. He is concerned about me and is trying to teach me he isn’t going to be the same one, like all the others. I want you to understand what you did will not be in the past but will continue to haunt me for the rest of my days on earth. Due to my recent changes in environment, I no longer communicate with men other than my significant other. I prefer to stay secluded from other men and have proven to each man that has contacted me, I am uninterested in talking. Those men have given me space and went on with their lives. You should do the same. I need you to move on from me. Understand my being and fully take what I’m saying into consideration. Please avoid contacting me in the future. Since the breakup, I have been wanting to be secluded, yet you keep returning. To be firm, I don’t want to be your companion. I don’t want to have a relationship with you. I don’t want to “talk”. I want you to leave me alone. If you can’t understand that, then that’s fine. I will gladly apprehend (Block) you from my life. I’m giving you the chance of doing the right thing. Be the adult.”

After sending the message, I didn’t hear from him for a few days, until I get a call last night. The person on the phone (different number) was a friend of Levi’s named Tyler. The odd thing was, the voice sounded A LOT like Levi’s. (He has done this before. I would get a message from a random person and talk with them about Levi. In the end, he would admit it was him and block me.) I blocked the number (Like I’ve been doing for the past 5 years) and made sure his Facebook was still blocked. I know it won’t stop him. He’ll find a new way to contact me. Every time he does, I get very frustrated and a huge migraine causes me to lay down for hours. Is there a way I can stop this once and for all?",relationship_advice
t3_chiw44,girlfriend of (9) months gone after she promised to not be like everybody else.,"Hello there Reddit, I am a (20) y/o male.  My girlfriend, or ex girlfriend I should say, is (18). Trying to not get too personal so I apologize in advance. I live in an abusive household, with an alcoholic mother, I’ve grown up with her, yadda yadda yadda. My girlfriend got accepted into a college that’s about four~ ish? Hours away from where we currently reside. We planned to move there together. She was happy about it, and so was I because we both got into the schools that we wanted to. Now on to the meat of the story. I love her to death. An immeasurable amount. And I have heard people from my age and upwards say that I don’t know what true love is, or something similar to that matter. But the truth is, I’ve been through a lot of pain. Forgive my assumption, but more than most. I had to mature very fast growing up.  Three days ago, she began to act very distant out of seemingly nowhere. Today I went to her house, and she broke up with me and said that she wasn’t ready for a real commitment. She knows that I come from this abusive background, she also knows that when I was about (15-17) years old, I was in an abusive relationship. Tldr of that one is, she tossed me around by leaving and coming back when she pleased, because I was a stupid kid and I loved her. When me and current ex gf got into our relationship I told her that I was scared of getting hurt like that again, and she looked me in the eyes and promised me that shouldn’t leave me. She broke my heart today, Reddit, and quite frankly I have absolutely no idea what to do without her. How the hell do I win her back?",relationship_advice
t3_chf0lo,Boyfriend keeps getting upset over minor inconveniences. How can I help?,"My boyfriend (25) and I (21) have a pretty good relationship. We talk about our problems and do our best to communicate. However, he's very childish when things aren't going well. 

For example: He loves playing videogames. Im not into it nearly as much as he is, but I went back home for the summer and it's something we can do together. We play games that involve a lot of teamwork and communication and when I make a mistake I try to laugh it off. It's a game, I'm trying to have fun. But with each mistake or imperfection I can hear his voice getting more and more annoyed, scolding me. And it makes me feel dumb and inadequate. I've told him this and talked about it at length. 

It's not just with games, it's things like me forgetting to bring cash  (even though ATMs exists) or being late (it's 5 minutes, we have the whole weekend together). Any minor inconvenience seems to be blown out of proportion; he knows this but doesn't know how to fix it. It's like, ""oh I'm upset and things aren't going how I planned. Let me blame you for everything and have a fit!"" Then I have to act like his mom to calm him down, let him know he's hurting my feelings, and listen to why he's frustrated once he collects himself. But I'm his girlfriend, not his mom. This is tiring. I get that he's upset and he's entitled to his emotions but how he deals with them and communicates it is a problem.

t3_chivbl,How can I [27M] get my [24F] girlfriend back,So the other day I broke up with my girlfriend via text message while she is in Europe for the summer.

Well after today I’ve realized how childish I was and how good of a thing I had with her. I want to work on this relationship and making stronger and better than ever. The problem is she won’t answer me. After I texted her she tried to FaceTime me a few times and texted me but i ignored it. I figured it would be easier to not talk to her.

t3_chiv2e,My (19f) girlfriend (23f) has only texted me ten times in the past four days,"Only ten white bubbles. She called me once that I’ll count. She just ignores me all day. I text her and I hate seeing how much I text her with no reply. 

We recently took a break. So I haven’t actually seen her in two weeks but we agreed to remain monogamous and together. We just needed time apart. But this break is towards the end, we’re going on a date tomorrow and the past four days she hasn’t texted me more than goodnight.

In the beginning of the break she texted me more, she would tell me where she was going and would let me know when she made it to her destination safely. But now she won’t even reply to a question.

I’ve been understanding because her friend just got done with surgery but that was the excuse everyday she didn’t talk to me. And we’re sorta long distance so texting is basically all we’ve got. I live an hour away and just moved out of her apartment because of the break. 

But she hasn’t texted me at all today. I’ve gotten one text so far. I asked if she was busy this morning and I got no reply. So around 9p.m I texted her asking if we were still a thing and she said: “yeah, why?”.

So I explained that I feel like she’s ghosting me. And I told her I’m not trying to be shady but I’d rather communicate and be straight up. And she didn’t reply to that.

Then a couple hours later I asked if we were still on for our date. No reply. It’s now 11p.m going on to 12a.m and we have a lunch date tomorrow. But I have no clue if she’s calling it off or not.

Over this break it feels like I don’t have a girlfriend. If she broke things off with me I think my life would continue on.

I don’t even feel like I have a girlfriend at this point. I’m thinking about calling this off myself. I don’t want to date someone for 20 percent of the time. I could be out having fun and being single. But I’m stuck in a non existent relationship. I’m not getting anything from being with her other than being chained down.

The conflict here, of me not leaving, is that I absolutely love her. She is the best thing that has ever been in the universe. I love being with her, I really do. But I don’t feel like I’m her girlfriend. I only feel trapped, romance blocked, intimacy block, any romantic type interaction from anyone blocked.

When I was single I was getting more romantic attention from girls. At least they’d talk to me.

Update: she replied an hour and a half later saying: “sure yeah” to my question about the date still being on. I’ll update on how the date goes, I just feel empty and I’m tired of venting to my best friend. Plus he sugar coats things for me.",relationship_advice

And I think I'm being flirted by two girls(other girl and make friends tell me they've been doing that) things like receiving compliments and they wanting to hug or even go out, they are taking the initiative.

The problem is I've always been on the other end and even my only girlfriend didn't give me a lot of attention (eventually we broke with no problems and are friends), and I don't know how to properly receive affection.

When they do something like a compliment y don't know how to responde very well outside of a thanks or something, so I would like to know a few tips or ways to be able to receive this kind of positive feedback or feelings, I don't want this to affect me more in the long run, and even if it is because I'm young everything will be helpful

t3_chitf7,Me [29M] suspects girlfriend [27F] is on dating site.,"So this last weekend my gf and i had a bad day. This ended up with us having a text convo about our relationship. Where we needed to communicate better and more often. So we end up fixing things for now and i have one pit left in my stomach, so i decide things are going good so i decide that its not gonna hurt to deal with it. I end up creating a temp/fake dating profile to see if she is on the website we met on. Well when i check there is a profile with her first name, age, height, religion, eye color, hair color, profession, and location on there without a picture. How do i handle this? She lives in a small town and its unlikely someone matching her exact description is on there. Also, there is no other info to go off of, but she did that when she was on there last time. The only way to really know is for the profile to upload an image, but i doubt that will happen. She was over last night and things went really well, so I'm confused and frustrated. The profile also wasn't online the entire time she was with me. Has anyone had this happen before? What did you do? How do i handle this without giving away that i snooped, especially if it happens to not be her. We don't live together, so that makes it harder for me. I normally would trust her, but after all the things that were brought up this weekend i thought she was going to leave me.

t3_chdpd1,Would it be weird trying to contact an childhood friend i lost with when i was very young ? She was my best friend when i was a kid and one day she just diseapear because she move out. And my parents just shrug it off back then.,"I found a poem i wrote her at middle school that i never open since it has at my father place. He though it was for him but when i open it, it was her name writing in big letters and a poem i wrote myself.

I never forgot her. But ive been dealing with a lot these last years so it was not something i could fathom.

Now im at a better place mentally and i would like to know how she been doing. If she is alright.

Her sudden disappearance back then has left me in a shock for years. I would like to know what happen. I dont care if she dont even remember me,  i would like her to know that all these years there was someone that was wishing her the best and that still do.",relationship_advice
t3_chgfx9,I [25F] need to end the relationships and move out of the house I share with my boyfriend [27M] he will be blindsided and potentially make it hell for me out of spite. Tips for getting out as cleanly as possible?,"As the title says, I currently live with my boyfriend of 6 years. We moved to our current place about a year ago, and I don’t really have friends or family here at all (few friends I made have since moved). 

I want to break up, for many reasons. One of them is that he is extremely toxic with a frightening temper. I am pretty confident when I tell him, he will make every moment hell until I am completely gone. He is currently on summer break from grad school, so he is home 24/7 - otherwise I would try to get things moving while he was gone, and stay just long enough to tell him.

Another issue is finances. I will owe him half the rent for 8 more months, which will put me a tight bind. I believe I can make it work, but any tips for moving out cheaply would also be appreciated...

So given this situation, I could really use some advice on how to make this move as clean and mature as possible (as much as is in my control, at least...)",relationship_advice
t3_chir1x,I think I’m falling out of love with my girlfriend,"Hi i M(21) and confused about my feelings for my girlfriend F(21).

I find myself now for the first time ever genuinely craving something else from someone new, and it’s just getting worse and worse the more I think about it. I don’t want to have these thoughts, I don’t want to hurt my girlfriend and I’m not even sure if I’m even capable of hurting her like that. I know she thinks of marriage often and plans her whole life and future around me. She’s got close relationships with my family and friends and I feel like we are too intertwined to stop now.

t3_chiqz5,Can't stop thinking about an old crush,"I've been with my bf for a while now and love him. He's my first ever official bf, however there was a guy I was very into almost all of high school (we'll call him H)  H and I were friends, and had a very ""flirty"" relationship for years, but either of us made a move, and he did date another girl for a bit. 

However, right before me and my current bf got together officially, H kissed me at a party and told me how he had wanted to do that since we had met. We made out/talked for the rest of the night. He didn't really know about current bf. A few days later, H found out, and we never talked about what happened at the party and fell out of contact after graduation, save for a few small conversations. He has a gf he seems to be happy with now, and like I said I love my current bf very much. However, I can't stop thinking about H.

 I don't know if it's because it was the first guy I ever really liked that much, if I'm freaked out because me and my current bf are getting very serious, or if this guy is just a big ""what if"". Why can't I stop thinking about him, and how do I stop?",relationship_advice

t3_chgd61,Caught boyfriend lurking,"Hey guys, my boyfriend (27) and I (23) have been dating over a year. We work together and In a couple of months we will be living together. Everything was great until I checked his phone for the first time (Note:  I only checked it 3 times) 
I found out he was looking up ex boyfriend, my best friend, and some random friends on my Facebook and Instagram.
I also check his messages and he had two of his ex still there. One of them was obsessed with him. The other I don’t know  she’s like really pretty and has a great body. Her name is Kara. With that being said, I told him to please delete his ex and he did. But I saw a message that Kara send him asking why he delete her. Later on after he came from Mexico he deleted the messages between them two. Not to mention all the messages he had there. He also looks up Kara in Instagram.  As a result of this my self esteem has gone down a lot. It’s like he is triggering that voice behind my head that says I’m not good enough for anything. In other words its making me depress. 
He also has another account private on Instagram. He only follows  cosplay.  He. Doesn’t follow me or anything. This makes me feel paranoid because I once saw a message between him and a cam girl. He was asking for his number and also the amount of money. Later on that girl deleted him .
He also goes to Mexico twice a year. And travel with his friends that are only females.. in the beginning of our relationship he brought his best friend to sleep over..she had just come from Mexico . He assured me that nothing happen between them two.
This year he came back from Mexico.. and he seems so happy to see me. I don’t know if it’s just me being paranoid but I have heard that when someone comes back like that from a trip.. its that they feel guilt over something they did.
Oh did I mention the time he was over there he wouldn’t really text me because the signal was weak he would text me around @ 12 am I check his sisters Facebook and saw nothing meaning he lied saying he was going with family. 
I don’t know what to do. I already told my family I was moving in with him... so I can’t back out don’t want to look bad either",relationship_advice
t3_chesdz,My (25f) roommate brings back bad memories,"I’m having some roommate problems and wonder what you guys think. So I moved in with a girl (roommate 1) several months after my previous living situation ended. She’s very nice, works hard, and is overall pretty good to live with. Her sister (roommate 2) is staying with us for the summer because she goes to school in another state and is now home. Roommate 2 is a lot to deal with. She periodically goes off her depression medications. She doesn’t work ever and will be in the house for days at time not going anywhere or doing anything productive. I’ve been very busy this summer between graduate school and work, usually only having one day a week off. Both roommate 1 and 2 have seemed to become more distant over the summer and rarely want to talk to me when I am home, which I just attribute to me only being home later in the evening and they must just be tired. Recently I’ve started to pick up on a more hostile tone it feels like and roommate 2 snapped at me over something stupid and small. I’m torn between waiting until September when roommate 2 will go back to school, or finding a new place to live now. I grew up in an abusive background with an alcoholic dad and a guilting mother who was never around and I’m in counseling now to try and move past this. When I’m around Roommate 2 it brings back feelings similar to what it felt like to love with my abusive family, and I really want to avoid this.

t3_chgcac,Dose anyone have some advice on being lonely,"I’m in a relationship of over a year and for a while these past few months me and my boyfriend didn’t really have anyone else to talk to besides each other. I guess I got too accustomed to it.

I’m really happy for him as he’s begun to reconnect with his old friend and play games and stuff with them like he used too, but while I am happy for him I can’t help but feel lonely.

Partly it’s because my house is empty beside my parents, all my sisters have moved out now and my only friend that I still talk to is away on a trip right now. I fully understand that not talking to anyone but my bf is unhealthy and so is the jealousy of him talking to other people but me but I can’t help but feel lonely. I really want to fix that and I want to get on a talking basis with my friends again but a lot of them just feel further away then they used to.

In short I guess is I only talk to about two people on a day to day basis and one of those is my boyfriend, my boyfriend is playing games with his friends and my other friend is out on a trip so I don’t have anyone to talk to and I feel really lonely (and my boyfriend is amazing and pays me loads of attention but sometimes he just leaves our calls way earlier then I would like) 

Does anyone know how to cope with this for a little while? At least so I can let my boyfriend have his fun without worrying about me?",relationship_advice
t3_chiozu,"Father is gay and abandoned me at age 5, now he’s 71 and wants to be in my life. What would you do if it were you?","I turned 48 in June 2019, I live in Central Pennsylvania and didn’t know anything about my father. At age five,  my mom and dad divorced; from that point until two years ago he was completely absent from my life. I have one full blooded brother, who is also from him, John is three years younger than me. 

My dad is now 71 and reached out to me two years ago. I guess that I also need to say that I have 9 brothers and a sister (I’m eldest). I forfeited my childhood to raise them all because while my parents were great at pumping them out every nine months, they did little to raise them. I have zero contact with any of my family due to several ongoing issues. 

To say that I crave contact with them all, is a gross understatement... I’m former US Army, and suffer from moderate/severe PTSD. Anything since 1989 that has happened to me, I have endured alone and without any family support. 

It is true that I have pushed many people away because of these symptoms over the years. I find myself wanting to tell my father to go play in traffic. I have been forcing myself for nearly two years now to go for lunch with him about once a month. Each time we do this we both feel awkward and are happy to get away from each other for a few weeks afterward. 

I suspect this has something to do with clearing his conscience before he dies. I suffered physical and emotional abuse (definitely child abuse under current law) at the hands of my mom and step father after my real dad left. 

When I asked why he wasn’t in my life?  He said “well, my father wasn’t there for me. It’s what I knew and thought was ‘normal.’” I thought that with your mom being psycho that she’d take it out on you boys if I wanted to see you guys. Additionally, he said he couldn’t deal with only having us twice a month, so he decided that if we reached out to him when older, then we could get to know each other.

Partly because I’m a very direct person who exhibits little tact, and partly because I want to make him feel badly for his choices, I have actually said to him “Dad, I want you to know that I don’t hate you. I wouldn’t even say that I’m angry at you. But I am ABSOLUTELY disappointed in you.” He got teary eyed, but quickly recovered and regained his composure. He then said, “I’m very glad to hear you say that.” 

I tend to not hold onto grudges, but he’s made very little effort to ask intelligent questions, learn anything of substance about me, I asked for some photos of him and he gave me some to scan. I asked why he didn’t ask for any of me, he said “if you want to give me some, I’ll take them.” Needless to say I didn’t give him any. 

If I could hear some comments from people, I’d appreciate it. Should I attempt to spend more than once a month with him? Should I tell him that I don’t want to do lunches. My gut reactions have been all over the map. I tend to have a very complex thought process and few others can relate to it, or me. It’s all made worse by the fact that for the last ten years I’ve been deeply lonely, angry, depressed and sad. I don’t know what’s “normal anymore,” I need some guidance please. I don’t have a good track record of making decisions and am usually scared into the status quo and do nothing.",relationship_advice
t3_chio3k,My (17f) self esteem and confidence has dropped since dating my boyfriend (18m),"I've been dating my boyfriend for a little over 5 months. I feel that I really am beginning to love him, and he says he loves me too. However, I've been having a lot of self confidence issues. I find myself constantly apologizing and taking blame for things just because I don't want him to feel bad.

This I think, has lead to my drop in self esteem. I've caught myself telling him he can 'do whatever he wants with me because i don't matter.' I know this is not something I should be saying. Yet I say it because I want to make sure im not holding him back or anything.

He sometimes gets kinda prickly or mad if I hang out with friends, and gets these moods where he only responds to my texts with one letter responses. Because of his little moods, I think I've started treating him like glass, im afraid to say anything in fear he will go into a mood and get angry with me. (I wanna say though, he's never physically abusive, hes very gentle with me)

We live fairly far apart but I do my best to see him once a week if I can manage it. When we are in person, everything is fine and he's the sweetest boyfriend I could ask for, caring and considerate. However over text he becomes distant and horrible and once he like half broke up with me because he didn't feel like talking. I know texting isn't for everyone (I don't really like it) but if I don't text him he gets upset.

I feel like all of this has really made me lose all self confidence and I don't know what to do. Advice?

I love the way things are between us, i do love you and i enjoy our time we share together. 
Maybe its too early to even be considering this or maybe im the one overthinking because I really am trying to look for something serious in my life at this point. I just dont see our future together, not yet at least...
And I thought it was just me, it still probably is but I thought that time would change things. Things ended up getting so frustrating for me at times. And sometimes it could be the teeniest things. 
I say that you don't understand because I don't believe that you do fully yet.
I know youve been trying and Ive noticed it and I really do appreciate that alot.

We had a talk afterwards, and here are several points that he made:
1.) when he said future, he meant he couldn’t see it in me yet as someone who will spend time with him for the rest of his life. Because he felt like I do not understand him fully sometimes, and we are always on different pages when we talk about certain topics
2.) he said he would wanna keep trying if I can tell him that we will work on this tgt and things are going to improve 
3.) he still loves me and does not want to break up with me

t3_ch3djt,My brother is a creep,"He used to be my best friend, he was the best brother I could ask for but a few years ago he started acting really strange, and started looking at me crudely whenever there was no one to see, and I remember three years ago when I got aware of this, I was home alone with him and he started complimenting me, my hair and got really close to me and started touching inappropriately until I freaked out and locked myself inside my washroom even then, there's a window inside my bathroom he took out a stool and stood on it to watch me by that time my mum came back. I couldn't tell her any of it because I didn't know how to, telling this would break her heart. Also I didn't know if she'd believe me either and even if she did, what can she possibly do? So after months of intentional touches and bumps when no one was looking I finally broke down and screamed at him. My sister, realizing my incoherent stuttering and screaming vouched for his terrible behavior. Mum not knowing what to do, after a while got into his room and made him 'promise' not to talk to me or even look in my direction ever again. 

Nothing happened for a few days, then this weird behaviour started kicking again, after another screamfest she made him promise, this time putting his hand on the holy book as if that would make a difference, it should've. And it did for awhile. Holy books are a nice guilt weapon.

Not for long, now his weird predatory gaze is back and I'm not sure if I can bear this any longer, my sister is gonna be married off in a year or two and who's to say my mother will always be present whenever I'm home, She's thinking about marrying me off with my sister as well but that's ridiculous. And the concept of moving out for girls is kinda hard from where I live. Please suggest me a way to get out of this hellhole. 

P.S. How can I convince my family that he needs to see a therapist? People just don't believe in mental disorders here.

Edit: I'm 18 years old and I'm from Iran, I'm sorry I didn't mention it I was being paranoid.

t3_chin0s,How to talk to my (21f) boyfriend (20m) about depression?,"Hello, throwaway since my friends and family know my other account. 

So, I've struggled with depression on and off for years, and even when it gets really bad I'm still high functioning, meaning I can effectively exist, even if just barely. 

Within the last year I've gotten with my boyfriend, and he's tremendously caring, helpful, smart, and everything good that's happened in my life. But the problem is, I have no idea how to talk about this issue. In the past I've pushed it down so much that I'd question if I'm really depressed or making it up, but I know what it really is. I've never talked to anyone about it, and I didn't have the resources to.

But I don't want this to ruin my relationship. Sometimes I get distant, disassociate, or get to the level where I can manage going to work and doing my daily personal tasks and that's about it. My boyfriend notices the changes, and doesn't really know what's up. 

I don't want him thinking he did anything, but I don't know how to bring it up. Baseline, I feel like talking to him about my perceived ""imaginary"" ""problems"" would only serve to upset him, not help me in any way, and ultimately drive him away. But I know not communicating is a huge issue that ends relationships.

t3_chilpc,how to deal with someone that has anxiety,"hey there
i made a reddit just to ask this
so context:
so im about to be a sophomore in high school soon and like freshmen year i met this girl in my math class. we didnt really talk that much but we all had common friends. we didnt start talking until after that class had ended, and we would text each other all the time. i had known that i kinda had a crush on her but i didnt really say much as i didnt want to lose her. i would try to make like small nudges or suggestions that i did like her but they were very small. eventually i found out that she did actually like me back and i felt elated as crap. i asked her out and she said yes but then she said that she got a lot of anxiety thinking about it and she said it was too much for her. i guess she was afraid of commitment and hurting me and i totally understood that so we stayed as good friends. our friends always “shipped” us and really suggested we go out but you know its kinda weird when people say that kinda stuff.

so fast forward to monday i had a party at my apartment and it was fun and stuff the girl and all our friends were there. we all ended up just chilling on my moms sofa bed watching shows and stuff but me and her ended up cuddling it all kinda happened unexpectedly it started with me just putting my arm around her but it was really nice and everyone was like “aww” and stuff. we both enjoyed it it was very nice. i texted her about it after everyone left and she said that she wanted to just try it out and see where it goes, which basically i asked her out again and she said yes. the next day though however she said her anxiety was getting to her again and i tried to talk to her maybe persuade her but she said it was just best we remain friends, and i was pretty bummed about it but yeah thats what happened then today we kept talking about it and she hit me with a whole conversation which i will link after this.

so now i feel like complete shit. i’ve worked really hard to express my feelings for her and i really care about her but her anxiety and the demons inside her get the best of her and i really dont blame her because its really not her fault. she likes me a lot too and its tearing me up just thinking about her. i told her i think we need a break from each other but i dont know what to do.",relationship_advice

Hey guys. 

I been with my boyfriend for like 8 years. He’s always been low key. That’s fine we grew to compromise with events and occasions. 

So for the past few months we have been in a weird rut 
. Every time I try to plan something together he says he has no money or let’s wait till next check or no it’s too hot . Literally an excuse for EVERYTHING. I even offer to pay so it’s not a burden. I just want to spend time with him
I stopped trying 

An old friend messaged him and wants to go to the springs next week 
I’m happy that he’s going bc he doesn’t do ANYTHING what I’m hurt is by the fact he is constantly rejecting me but jumps for his friend. It really hurts and he won’t understand that 
I can see where he is confused when we’re arguing about it because I’m like 
“I want you do go out and have friends but it hurts my feelings “ lol I totally get the confusion but I can’t help but to be so hurt by this. Why can’t he make that same effort or have that same momentum with me?

Am I wrong? I’m okay if I’m wrong I’ll apologize but I cannot help it. This physical tingle in my heart it genuinely hurts my feelings.

t3_chg4u0,Uncle's confession to his wife after being diagnosed with cancer,"A few days ago my dad's youngest brother (50) called us to tell us he's in the process of being diagnosed with cancer. He definitely has some form based on symptoms, scan results are pending. My uncle is talking to my mom basically having a panic attack, as one would with something like this. He's telling my mom that he wants to kill himself and that this is his ""amends"" for all the bad things he's done in his life. My mom is reassuring him and telling him all the comforting/rational things you say when someone says they want to kill themselves. My dad then leaves that night and goes to be with my uncle to take him to his next scan and keep an eye on him. That was 2 days ago. 

Today, my mom is on the phone with my uncle's wife, call her M. M and my uncle have been together for about 15 years and have 3 kids; a 25 year old, a 13 yr old, and a 2/3 year old. M tells my mom that in the process of my uncle panicking and saying this is his payback for all the bad things hes done and that he can't face his kids and other things you say out of fear, he blurts out that he's had an affair. It's completely wrecking my Aunt M, aside from her husband now having cancer. 

Now I personally am pissed that he is selfish enough to have told her like this. Selfish in the first place to even have it to begin with but people are people and we do dumb shit. I understand that he's under a ton of stress from this diagnosis and is scared he's going to die which causes people to do crazy things. I just think it's a horribly self centered to blurt it out in this situation. It seems as if he wasn't going to tell her until his diagnosis, so why not keep it to yourself a bit longer till things settle down? 

Now M, has to choose between now caring for her a-hole husband through this diagnosis then kicking him to the curb or kick him to the curb first. 

It's a fucked up situation. I wanted you guys to let me know how or if you'd tell someone this kind of confession, and what you'd do if you were her.",relationship_advice

I overreact to things, can be sensitive, and don't know when I'm being toxic. I have really bad anxiety when I don't see him. It feels like I'm always questioning if we're doing alright when he reassures me constantly. Like it's so good, it's too good to be true. I've had bad childhood trauma and often feel like a burden. Recently, I requested that he write me a letter so I can read it instead of bothering him with my anxiety. He told me to reach out to him but I would rather have the letter so he won't be frustrated with me.

t3_chig75,I'm Uncomfortable with My Fiance Supporting His Mother and Sister,"Hello everybody, 

I wanted to reach out for some advice on a situation between my fiance (30M) and I (24F). My fiance, we'll call him Jose, is Mexican-American, I'm Caucasian-American with recent Eastern European heritage. The reason I bring this up is because we are both very family oriented, and from large families. Jose has told me many times that my family is even closer than his is, being that we spend more time together, are more open with each other, and generally treat each other better. 

That being said, Jose and I grew up with single mothers. My mother did not speak much English when she was younger, but she worked hard to learn, and eventually got a decent job working in the U.S. government. We struggled and went hungry often as young children, but my sisters and I were generally supported by my mom whilst we grew up. Now that my sisters and I are older, we offer to help my mom financially, but she likes to work and is doing well on her own. She says she would like to retire when she's 70, but currently she works full time, and works very hard at that! 

Jose's mother, on the other hand, has lived in the U.S. for over 35 years and speaks almost no English, although she understands a small amount. When Jose's older brother turned 14/15, their mother went from working full time to part time, and made the older brother go out and get a full time job. 2 years later, when Jose turned 14/15, she made him do the same thing, so she could stop working completely. Jose's mother effectively ""retired"" in her early 40's. I have asked Jose if she was sick, or if something else happened. He informed me that she simply was tired of working, and decided to quit the second her two sons could support her. 

Well, it's been 15 years now, and she hasn't worked a day since. She is not demanding, and she lives modestly, however I still do not think it is right that an able-bodied, healthy woman did this to her children. Jose's mother plans to be completely financially dependent on her two sons until the day she dies. That means about 50 years of paying for her apartment, cable, cell phone, clothes, food, trips to Mexico, everything. 

None of this is news to me, I've known about it since shortly after Jose and I met, and I've chosen to keep my mouth shut, because he's only gotten upset at me in the past when I told him how I felt about this. What really bothers me is recently, his little sister (28) walked out of her part time job as a hotel front desk clerk and quit. She's been unemployed for about 2 months now, and she doesn't seem interested in finding another job. This same little sister has been working on getting her 4-year degree for the last 8 years now, and has only passed 3 or 4 classes in that time. To top it all off, she completely trashes the apartment her and her mother share. She lets her cat defecate wherever it would like, and attack visitors to the apartment. When Jose has tried to tell her this is unacceptable, she has attempted to slap and verbally abuse him. We almost never go to the apartment anymore, despite the fact that Jose is helping to pay for it each month, because it's so trashed and full of hostility. His little sister blames all of this on her anxiety, and neither Jose nor I are doctors, however we both think anxiety doesn't excuse his little sister from being this way.

While Jose readily admits and understands all of this is not normal, healthy, or right in any way, he gets so angry at me if I point any of that out to him, or if I suggest that his little sister needs to start looking for a new job. He insists that they are his family members, and he will give them money when they need it, for as long as they need it.

I've given up on his mom ever working again, because now she is at least getting to be an older lady. In case anyone is going to ask, not speaking English is not a barrier for employment where our families are from, as we live in a large U.S. city that borders Mexico, and it has literally millions of Spanish-only speakers. However it really bothers me, the idea of his little sister sitting on her behind all day while my fiance helps support her. 

One of the strangest parts of this is that Jose is very modern, Americanized, and not overly macho at all. He was incredibly supportive of me earning my bachelor's degree, and is now very supportive while I am earning my master's. We both work full time, and he's told me so many times he loves the fact that I'm hard working, independent, self sufficient, etcetera. On his part, Jose grew up in relative poverty, and as an adult he worked hard to become an air traffic controller. So, it hurts me to see him having to shell out hundreds of dollars from every pay check he earns to support two healthy, able-bodied women who seem to simply not want to work. Both Jose and I make very good money in our respective professions, so providing for our own children in the future will not be an issue due to his mother and sister's expenses, however just the fact that he has all these people leeching off of him, makes me very hesitant to combine our finances in any way. We are going to start pre-marital counseling soon, but Jose has already made it clear he never, ever wants to change his principles on taking care of his family. 

Am I completely in the wrong here? Am I heartless? Should I hold my tongue on both his mom AND his sister? Is this a normal thing in the Latino community, for women to be so helpless and lazy? This is NOT the first time I've seen young Latino men (or boys) supporting grown women who seem to be ""work shy"". Do these women not feel embarrassed, or as if they should, I don't know, provide for their children? Would you say/do anything differently? Why would Jose get so upset when I brought this up or pointed out any of this issue in the past, when by his own admission he sees the same things I've pointed out? 

tl;dr: My fiance's mother has been completely financially dependent on him and his brother for 15 years, and now his little sister is following the same track.

t3_chif59,I (f32) want to email and meet a well-known tattoo artist (M40). I'm also a well-known artist in a different field but don't know how to make an introduction without looking like a thot. Help?,"I sent a question about an art piece recently via email and he answered simply ""Yes, thank you for enjoying my designs"".

Well, I want to meet him, even collaborate with him and maybe more. We are both of equal attraction to each other and while my art has sold much more, it doesn't matter to me. I doubt it would matter to him.

Basically, I think I bring talent to the table with my history and he, to mine. Still, I'm terrified of his fame.

I've written the topics I want to talk about. There's about 6 different topics about his art, collaborating, my art, other artists I think he might like, etc.

I don't want to overwhelm him and send it all. I also have no idea what I compliment since he gets compliments about his art all day long. Do I talk about his looks then?

I would love to hear all aspects and I so appreciate it. I am so sorry for being clueless. Thank you. ;)

t3_chiepq,Afraid to move in with my boyfriend,"My (24F) boyfriend (26M) and I have been together for a little over three years now. From the get-go I seemed to always be one step ahead of him. Call me spontaneous, bad at judgement, whatever... it’s true. 

About a year and a half into us dating my mom moved 2 hours away and I was forced to find an apartment on my own (my dad lives an hour away). No matter how hard or how long I looked I could not find a compatible roommate. So I’ve been having to stick it out in a studio on my own which is still difficult ($900 with nothing included, 40 mins from work). When this began I suggested to my boyfriend we move in together and he recoiled HARD. He even dumped me for about a week (lol, we laugh about it now). In his situation, he is his family’s backbone; supporting them through a tough financial time and being relied on by his grandparents. I was embarrassed but I understood.

Since then I’ve daydreamed about living together and how much fun it would be. All of our friends live with their significant others and we spend a lot of our time together so, why not?

A few weeks ago he let me know he was ready to start looking for a place together starting next year after his sisters wedding. I cried, I was so happy! He explained that his parents will be moving and since his dad is receiving his pension, he’s not really needed to be home anymore. He wants to find a new job and move in with me (we work together, also). 

That excitement has worn off... and now I am freaking out!!! I don’t know why, but I have this horrible sense of doom about the idea. I feel like we might end up resenting each other if we live together. This sudden anxiety is driving me crazy! He is still very excited about living together but for some reason I can’t come to it. I can’t tell if this is possibly me being unsure about the relationship or nerves because I’ve never really lived with anyone before. Has anyone ever had the same thing happen? People who HAVE moved in with their SOs, what was your experience like?",relationship_advice
t3_chg04w,"Confused about DH's ""Joke""","Hi. My DH (29m) and I (28f) have been secretly married for a bit over a year and together for a total of 5 years. We're engaged to everyone else and actively planning a wedding.

Both of our work lives have been pretty crazy lately and we're both stressed and tired all the time. DH is working about 5 or 6 days a week regularly (with some nighttime work) and today was my 18th day in a row working on my feet for 8+ hour shifts with no sign of a day off anytime soon. 

DH still wants to go out and do things but I'm so freaking exhausted from working, gym, dog care, house care, and cooking that most days I just want to get home (at like 6pm), eat, and go to bed. 

The other night we were watching TV and DH asked me if I wanted to see a movie that night. I told him that I didn't want to because of being so drained. His response was, ""I'm starting to think I'm with the wrong person"". 

I sat in silence for a min as that words repeated in my head. ""Why would you say that?"" I asked. ""It was a joke"" he replied. 

That joke isn't funny. 

It's been stuck in my head since he said it. Are we really wrong for each other? Or is he just stressed? 

I asked him a few days later when he was going to start dating me again, because to be honest, we don't ever go on dates and he really hasn't done much for me recently. (just a month or so ago I took him on a huge night out in the city so he could decompress and get away) I'm not saying I expect huge, expensive gestures, but a cheap or free date night would be nice to know he still gives a fuck.. Just to know he's thinking about me or something? 

I don't know.. I want to chock it up to our crazy lives right now, but this isn't the first time he's made ""joking"" comments like this. Am I in for a world of hurt?

Edit 1: I should have worded him asked me to a movie better. The conversation was: DH ""I wanna see this movie! Let's go!"" Me: ""When? (it's close to 8pm and I have to work early AM)"" DH: ""now!"" sorry, but this is not a date to me.",relationship_advice

My GF has been saying that talking to me is like talking to her gal pals. It's all small talk or topics that arent serious. She said sometimes it's like we're two friends who just hang out.

She doesn't engage in a lot of convos so that doesn't help as well. She's busy with work and admitted that she isn't invested in the relationship as I am.

t3_chiclc,"My bf (19m) said a previous crush was more attractive than me (17f) in an argument, has he not moved on?","Here's the whole story. 

There's this girl he told me he had a crush on for all of high school. He liked her properly for the last year of highschool until she gave some guy head in a hookup and he was devastated. 

A guy called her names and talked about being sexual with her really crudely and he tried to drown this guy. 

Around the same time as meeting me, he mentioned in a comment online asking if hes ever had an unhealthy crush, and a whole year after graduating says ""he needs to get over it someday"".

He tells me at the start of our relationship  he still talks to some girl hes known for a while. Who I suspect was this girl because he mentioned messaging her. 

He told me he blocked her off social media but I found him liking stuff on her insta while we were dating, when he had told me he had blocked her and she deleted all of her social media anyways.  He expressed to me that guys always like people's stuff with intention, it's not just a careless like. 

I confronted him and be said he was drunk and his friends had liked it, not him. Sounds kinda bs to me.

One time in an argument he lost it and said she was more attractive than me and her t*ts were bigger than mine. He's also expressed her being cute, mentioned he used to think her ass was nice. 

He calls her names sometimes when I get upset but it feels so forced and he once later  mentioned ""I called blah blah A *** FOR You""

Am I just being insecure or is he still not over her? I am insecure to begin with and I keep comparing myself to this girl and thinking he still feels something for her.",relationship_advice
t3_chic7z,I (M23) Need advice on repairing a damaged friendship that could be a relationship,"So last year in Toronto (where I live) I met this awesome girl (23) from Holland who comes to Toronto every summer to see family. I only got to chill with her the final 2 weeks of august, but every time we were together it was so genuine and fun. After the first date, she was basically hooked to me. Her friends would ask if she wanted to hang out, but she always carved out time for me over them which is weird because I only had 1 date with this chick. Guess I got her attention :) Before she left back to holland, I told
her we should be exclusive when she comes back (in summer 19’) and she was down with it. 

This where I made the mistake🤦🏻‍♂️. I told my friends that we hooked up and basically boasted about it because they’re all like she’s so hot! It’s felt awesome getting the validation of “damn you got with here?!😮😏👌🏻”

Fast-forward to the past 3 weeks, she’s back and catches wind of the word that spread and is super pissed saying I’m disrespectful and such and such. I continue to deny I told people anything.. 

What should I do??? I don’t want to waste this opportunity again.",relationship_advice
t3_chd2cu,"Boyfriend[26M] doesn’t act supportive of my[22F] career, even though his words are sweet - Am I expecting too much?","Not sure if my title makes sense. Basically, my bf always tells me supportive things and sends me encouraging texts. However, he doesn’t demonstrate this in his actions as I’m working toward something. 
 
Some examples/instances:
My bf and I would meet up every weekend throughout college (all throughout our relationship, I just graduated so things are a little different for now). He works a professional job. On weekends, I of course needed to get some studying done. I would tell him about this ahead of time and did my best to be accommodating when I did my work (in the morning when he’s getting ready, while he’s relaxing in other ways, etc.). However he always seemed impatient with me when I had to do work. 

I would ask him if he could help me study by reviewing notes out loud and he mostly ignored me, sometimes he’d say yes but just never do it. Meanwhile he also had things he was working on and he never seemed to try to accommodate me - it was more like “hey gf, I’ve got a call now, we’ve got to get back home.” (Not always a work call). Sometimes he would ask me if a general time frame was okay and I appreciated that, but this wasn’t often. 

When I asked him for help with job interview prep (very generic stuff that he’s familiar with), he never helped me. I asked several times and again, just like studying, it never happened. He even started his own side hustle that involves helping other college kids with their job interview processes. He would take hours worth of phone calls when we were together, helping kids with the same things that I needed help on. He has also helped his friends with interview prep.


I don’t know if I’m expecting too much. He is excited for me about things, but does stuff like the above. He does help me out sometimes, but seems visibly annoyed and will not spend much time. 
I, on the other hand, go out of my way to support him with stuff (his side hustle which I mentioned). Whenever he talks about it I let him go on and ask questions, which he never does for me. I also proofread related things and give my input and he would sometimes do the same for me, but not as much as I do for him. 
 
I really don’t know what to think of this. We’ve been dating for 2.5 years, if that fact helps.",relationship_advice
t3_chib96,evaluate my breakup,"so i broke up with my bf of 2 years. Tell me if im being unreasonable or it was the right decision lol

The things he did that hurt me the most

so our relationship was very unstable in that we broke up like 5 times and got back together again.

But during one of those times, when we were ""broken up"", (we broke up on a saturday), he asked out a girl to homecoming dance with posters and roses on Sunday, a day after we broke up. (btw he never gave me roses...)(i also dont go to his school). THEN he posts on instagram a picture of them together saying it was the best night and that she was super cute. I got so hurt by this. But then he said sorry and I forgave him for it.

But the incident that led me to calling it off was that he talked shit about my parents and spread rumors and lied to me and tried to cover it up.

He spread rumors at his school (which my little sister attends) that my dad hit him. This was in the beginning of the relationship (my dad didn't approve of him). When I asked him about it several times, each time he changed his story, and there was this whole incident that popped up recently that blew up, and he said my dad didn't hit him. And then i asked him why did you lie to me before, and he denied lying to me trying to deceive me.

The thing that upsetted me the most was that he lied to me and hid it from me for over 2 years and was unashamedly, unapologetic. And only when I said aren't you going to apologize, he said im sorry. And my dad is such a wonderful person and he worked so hard to get my family a house and food and everything I ever needed. I was so mad that he spread rumors that my dad a violent abusive person.

Honestly, he was normal looking, wasn't smart, pretty lazy, and complained a lot. The only reason why I liked him was that he was so nice to me and caring.

Other minor problems: he couldn't really make me laugh, had TERRIBLE jokes. We had boring convos. He has low self esteem and always texts me im so ugly and dumb and all that hoping that i would say nonono ur wonderful and i love you

Was it right to break up with him?

TL;DR -- he talked shit about parents, hurt me by asking out another girl and posting on instagram.",relationship_advice
t3_chfw98,I (18F) don't know if I should continue talking to this guy (18M),"There's a guy ive been talking to for a few months and we both like each other. He's expressed how he feels about me and vice versa. The only problem is, he's not ready for a relationship. He says he's got a lot going on and I know he does but I feel like he just doesn't want to commit. I got mad over something I saw on social media with him involving another girl after he mislead me telling me we were working towards a relationship (which we talked about, he apologized for misleading me, I apologized for acting a little crazy lol). And we are both single. The whole situation is so confusing. We both like each other, he says he's not all lovey dovey with other girls, but then says he's not mine yet and that it's unfair if I say I'm his. I just don't understand, I definitely know he likes me because his actions have shown me, but how can you talk to other people, date other people, have sexual relations with other people if you really like someone? Is it just me who sees no point in doing that? I feel like if you actually like someone, you're just not interested in other people. So I have two options here: continue seeing him and talking to him until he's ready for a relationship, while seeing other people until then, or to just leave him alone and protect my feelings but miss out on what could be a potentially great relationship. If I do continue talking to him, I feel like he will lose respect for me. From experience, I feel like guys would just take advantage of a girl who stays knowing he's probably seeing other women. I just don't know, because I'm really enjoying the time I spend with him. I just don't want to invest my emotions into something that may not ever be anything. I feel like I'm being so stupid right now and my emotions are really clouding my judgment.

TL;DR: Guy and I like each other, but he isn't ready for a relationship. Gives me mixed signals, tells me he likes me but hints at seeing other women when he knows I don't have interest in anyone else.

t3_chfw75,Respectful suggestions I (22M) can let my lady-friend (25F) know she should tone down her flirty yet derogatory teasing of me?,"Hey, just want to start off by saying me and this woman have admitted to having feelings for one another, and are open to dating in the future once we know eachother a little better.

With that, she admits to liking me, and she likes to tease me a lot when she flirts, which I am okay with. Only sometimes, I think she takes it a bit too far, and can say some pretty derogatory things to me under the guise of being flirty.

For instance, when I mentioned I was thinking about being a volunteer firefighter, she said it sounded dangerous, and when I asked if she was ""concerned for her baby (me)"" she responded by saying ""No, my baby is a beta who will run from a fire""

Or another example, I showed her a picture of me when I was a baby, and she said it was cute, and asked me ""what happened to you"".

I try to set her up to say something nice/sweet to me after, but she doesn't, and I really don't know how to feel about it.

I do like her, and I know she obviously isn't being serious, but I feel she has been crossing some lines recently.

She is generally a pretty sensitive person and may not even realize she could be starting to go too far. I would like her to tone it down before it gets toxic, yet I don't want to hurt her feelings or make her feel like her advances are not wanted.

I even would be fine with what she is doing right now, as long as she sometime later said something nice that made it clear the teasing was in jest.

So cumulatively, I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about two years now. Last year (at this time in the summer) we broke up after dating for about a year and a half. We stayed apart for about six or seven months and in that time I dated someone else. The entire time we were broken up, my now-boyfriend begged for me back. He bent over backwards for me in a lot of ways, spoiled me with gifts constantly, acted like he would die without me in his life. This behavior from him coupled with abusive behavior of the person I dated in the interim led me to break off things with the other person and get back with my now-boyfriend. We have been back together for about 5-6 months at this point. 

However, now that he has me, he acts like he could not care less about dating me. We fight often, I often feel disrespected and unloved. Like most posts on this sub, I suppose my situation has obvious signs that I should leave. However, I can’t let go of our history and the feelings I had for him when he was trying to win me back (gifts/spoiling aside, he acted like the sweetest man ever). Now I’ll text him and sometimes get a short response, sometimes get left on read. We live together (have separate rooms though, from when we were broken up) yet sleep in the same bed probably about 50% of the time, the other times he just never comes to bed and stays in his own room playing video games. Before, when we were together in person he acted like I was the most fascinating thing in the world to him and I had all his attention. Now he’s glued to his phone 24/7 and gets grouchy with me when I ask him to put it down and be present in the moment. 

He also starts fights with me constantly. He’s not an angry guy, so it’s not violent arguing or anything. He’ll just say something that he knows will shut me down emotionally and makes me not want to talk to him as much, so that I’ll leave him alone for a while. I have no problem giving him space if he needs or wants it, but this method of getting that time and space is very hurtful to me. The past several days this exact scenario has happened. Each time I am the one to eventually try and make up with him, as he will not do it on his own.

It’s crazy because I’M the one in this relationship diagnosed with bipolar disorder, yet he is the one who seems like night and day. It’s starting to feel like how it did right before we broke up the first time, yet when I ask if he wants to stay together he says yes and says if he wanted to break up with me, he would.",relationship_advice

We been together for 8-9 months now, and when I think of it it has always been this way but I think the honeymoon faze was over it really hit me hard. She has never pulled a string with me, never showed me how much she loves me. Or if she loves me. Sure, it have happened some times that she does or says something but it’s super rare. She’s just like this as a person, I get that. But I need affection, it seriously feels like we’re just friends with benefits. She never touches me, never kisses me, never hugs me etc on her initiative. 

For the last two months at least it has been super hard and I’ve been super low because of it. But I feel needy for feeling this way. And it has taken a big turn on the relationship because of my lows. 

Now we went on vacation for two weeks, and I’m really burned out because of it. We are here with her friend and hers boyfriend and they hold hands, kisses, hugs or just touch each other. And I’m very jealous about them and theirs relationship. I want it like that to. So I get even more low and broke down infront of my girlfriend telling her how much it pains me. This was 4-5 days ago. She got better the first two days but it’s kinda the same now so I mentioned it again last night and she kinda got sad and angry with me for not giving her a chance to better herself. I apologized since it’s kinda true. 

Now it just feels like somethings in the air between us. She feels off, I also told her I also got jealous the other day because on of her guy friends. I thought fuck it I’m going full honesty mode from now on but she got like wired about it, like I was being childish. I might be but still, not the response I wanted when I’m opening up.

First I want to say, I love him a lot. And he has helped me more then I can say. I have a three year old son and he pays for everything for him. He buys me gifts, gives me money, takes me on trips.  I was really struggling before I met him. My life is a million times better.

He really treats me well usually.

But the other morning I slept with him and I just felt so dirty. He had told me that his wife was pregnant even though he promised me he wasn’t going to have any more children with her.

I just started crying and he saw and asked me what was wrong, and I told him he’s whats wrong and I hate him and he’s a liar and a manipulator.  

He just shook his head at me and laughed.

I told him how could he expect me to want to keep doing this when I’m always going to be just a sex doll to him. He told me “come on now, you know you mean more to me than that”. I asked him doesent he think I might want to get married and have a real family one day, and that many men want me not just him so I don’t need him.

For some reason that set him off and he told me, “stop talking now before you say something you’ll regret”

Then through tears I just yelled at him to leave, and he just grabbed my throat, and said “I said to stop talking”

I tried to push him away but he tightened his grip, and hit me in my stomach hard and it knocked the air out of me.

When he finally let go of my neck he said, “if you ever talk like that to me again, it will be much worse. so fall in line”. and he slapped my chest and left.

He called me later, and asked me if I had calmed down and if I was feeling better.

I feel like I hate him. I got myself into this mess. Part of me wants to just move on and forgive him the other part wants to never see him again. I just need advice on how to deal with this. It made me feel absolutely horrible. I’m still crying.",relationship_advice
t3_chi8rs,I hate it when my bf (28) plays video games,"Hi guys,

I was wondering if I could get your opinion and advice. My boyfriend loves playing PS4, at the moment mainly Apex Legends. It's his way to relax etc. He doesn't play excessively and makes sure to make time for me, his friends and soccer. 
Anyway, he is considered with it, but I still can't help to be annoyed anytime he turns it on. We have a studio apartment and won't be able to live in a bigger apartment for the next 6 months. Meaning, I have no space to go away, unless I leave the house (which I don't always want to do). I hate the sound of the constant shooting, all those ""stupid"" comments in the game etc. He often plays with a headset, but he's also very vocal when he plays. He swears etc. Especially when I come home from work (I work with traumatised children with behavioural issues and verbal abuse is a daily thing for me) it really bothers me. I don't want to come home from work (I love my job btw) and have to continue listening to my boyfriend shouting and swearing at the TV, even though he is considerate and uses a headset. I feel like such a bitch about it, but it's stressing me out. I want to come home after work and relax. I don't want to come home to continue listening to shouting and swearing. I don't even know why I'm writing all this - maybe I just need to tell someone",relationship_advice
t3_chi80q,Girl continually harassing my BF and I. Should I keep ignoring or tell her off one last time?,"This has been going on for years. We live in the same apartment building (unfortunately we are not able to move yet). Every so often she will try to text my BF (her number is blocked). She sits in front of the door to go outside (all apts are inside). Tries to talk to him when I am not there.

She got a job at my work (fortunately I was able to get a new job really fast). The last couple days she has been sitting outside at the times we leave for work and come back home. The other night she sent me a message over the work app (she is blocked on all social media) asking me to come outside and talk to her.

Some quick info, long story short she is just a terrible person that we do not want to associate with. We hung out with her a few times when we first moved in, realized she is addicted to pills, cheats on her BF, and has no self control or common sense. We asked her to leave us alone and she will not.

So I know she wants attention. I want to keep ignoring her because I don't want to give her the satisfaction. But I also feel like I need to just yell at her (in a directive way) like ""look I know you keep doing this, you are a horrible person, you need to leave us the fuck alone"".

What does anyone think is the better option: keep ignoring, or firmly tell her off?",relationship_advice
t3_chi7iq,I [18F] am trying to decide if I should break up with my boyfriend [19M] of 2 years because he doesn't understand me anymore,"\*Throwaway account cause my dad found my actual Reddit\*

My boyfriend and I got together at a really bad time in my life. I had just left an abusive relationship and he was there as my comfort system, and well it grew from there and here we are 2 years later! Sadly, the relationship has gotten really difficult since then. I just graduated high school and I am going to a rather large university in my area in the fall, and since I am way in the suburbs I have to dorm at the university. My boyfriend is a year older and goes to a university much closer to our tiny town and is living with his parents. I would see him pretty much never since I would be at school most of the time or spending time with my parents when I come home to visit once the fall hits. Meaning summer is all I get to see him. 

Second, we have been arguing over the fact that he works 12 hour days3 times a week and 8 hour days 2 days a week and that I never get to see him. I am always making sacrifices around his work but when we do have a chance to be together (Saturdays mostly) he always complains of either pain from work, tired from work, and paying for his school. All of which I get but the one day I get to be with him he always talks about it. When I try talking with him about less ""work-stuff"" he says I am being a jerk for complaining about work being everything to him and that I don't understand. He never tries to see things from my point-of-view.

So what should I do? Do I break up with him or should I try to make this relationship work despite all the difficulty?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My boyfriend will almost never see me in the fall and doesn't try to understand that I want to spend more time with him and not plan it all around work 24/7",relationship_advice
t3_chfrvx,Should I [28M] tell the husband of my ex gf [29F] about our relationship?,"Several months ago I had a casual encounter with a woman in a bar, one thing led to another and we went home together. After a month of hooking up she informed me that she was married but they are getting divorced and he moved back to the original state they came from. Things started getting more serious between us and we began dating, went on vacations together, she was going to move once the divorce shit was cleared up, the whole shebang. 

Unfortunately, she found out her dad is sick (apparently) and she had to move back to her home town and our relationship was over. Things got ugly at the end but we reconnected a couple months after the fact because she kept her job in the city we met and she would be coming once a month for work. 

In June she came back for work and we decided to meet up for some drinks and catch up. She told me her dad was doing better then expected, and that the divorce was still moving forward and they both had their separate places in her home town. We ended up having sex a couple times while she visited. 

This past week she was out again and stayed with me the entirety of her trip, we went to some concerts, talked about working it out, etc... she left on Sunday and Tuesday afternoon she hits me with the “I don’t have feelings for you anymore” less then 36 hours after leaving my apt. At this point I was like fuck it, whatever, bye Felicia. 

But the big thing is, I think she’s been lying to me about her husband situation since she moved back (I’m fairly certain she was not lying when we were together because she was with me all the time, ignored all his calls, fought constantly when they connected, etc..) because I childishly did some snooping on FB. I seen that they do have a place together in her home town and at the end of the month they’re going on a vacation to Spain, which she told me was just her, her dad and step mom. 

I’m not sure if I should let this man know about our relationship and what’s happened between us. I feel pretty bad because I oblivious that someone could be this big of a compulsive liar and we definitely had sex while they’ve been back together. 

They may be some details missing so I’m happy to provide more details or context if needed.",relationship_advice
t3_che3hp,Boyfriend of 5 years made out with a girl at the club,"Hi.

I am 21yrs old, female. My boyfriend is 23 years old. We have been together for 5 years and had no issues at all. We love each other a lot. 

Yesterday night he was at the club with his friends, he asked me if I wanted to come but I had to sleep early cuz I was working today. Once I came back from work he told me he had to say something. He was very upset and sad.

He told me he got drunk yesterday night and made out with a random girl at the club. Among the lines he said:

""After doing what I did I immediately thought of telling you. I already feel guilty. I am not going to start making excuses how it all happened because I was drunk or anything else like that. Perhaps if I was sober things would have been different, but it still doesn't matter. I chose to do it. I know you are mad at me, disappointed, sad. I don't want to start begging you to stay with me. If I were in your shoes chances are I would end it immediately. I fucked up. And I am saying all those things because it's the truth. I have broken your trust, and I know once it's broken it's over. If you decide to stay with me I promise you I am going to work on myself and never repeat a mistake like this. If you decide to end it, I again understand you. I totally respect it. It's up to you. I am an idiot and I want to say sorry for what I did. I love you. ""

I really don't know what to do. I really love him but what he did disappointed me a lot. I feel like the trust is literally broken. I have been with him for so many years and he was even saving up so we can build a brand new house for us.

Advices would be appreciated. I really can't decide and I feel really terrible currently.",relationship_advice
t3_chcvaa,"My boyfriend (29M) got a job offer across the country, and I (32M) am struggling. Please help.","For context: My seven-year relationship ended in March last year, when my partner revealed to me that he was getting his Master's out of state, he didn't love me anymore, and he had no intention of renewing our lease. He had a lot of issues, so I never once took it personally. I was a steadfast support system for him throughout law school, and he decided that a relationship just wasn't what he wanted right now. Okay.

Six months later, I began dating a research chemist. We hit things off really well. We are very happy together, and we've had each other's back already through tough times.

Through the recent months of our relationship, it has become apparent that he hates his job and is looking for something new. While he was in Sacramento visiting his mom, a friend of a friend from a California university reached out to him with a potential role in their science department.

Flash-forward to today: after a couple of phone interviews, he's gotten a verbal offer. He has yet to accept it, he admits that he is torn up about it, and has a lot to contemplate. He would be moving across the country, away from me (New York City). It is a great school, a great role, with tons of potential for growth. It's everything he's been looking for, professionally.

From my perspective, he has no other reason to turn it down, except for me. But I have hid my heartbreak from him and encouraged him to do what he feels is best. He says that we will get through this no matter what.

I have to be honest, this is the very embodiment of everything that I feared would happen when I got into this relationship. I have already been left for a job once, and to possibly have it happen again the following year is just... I can't express it.

Would I be willing to move with him, you might ask? If he offered, I would first ask to come out and visit, see the area and see what I think of it. I've never been to California, and I don't know many people on the west coast. It would be a massive question and change for me. If we had the luxury of at least a couple of years before this happened, I could at least have more information to go off of.

tl;dr My boyfriend is contemplating a job across the country, which would put our relationship in a very precarious position. I'm struggling to find a silver lining, or some sort of comforting perspective.",relationship_advice
t3_chi5qm,Guy (m17) I’ve (f17) been talking to seems to be avoiding me.,"( this is a background on the guy I’m talking to from my other story )

This is a long story so buckle up lol. 

So in December 2018 I met him through a show. The moment I met him ( give him the letter P ) I knew he was gonna be important to my life. I wasn’t sure how but I knew he was gonna have a impact on my life. So we started talking and went on a date. Unfortunately, He wasn’t looking for a commitment then and he let me know before feelings got too complicated. He had just got out of a relationship. But We hung out as friends after that. 

Sooo fast forward to May. I was auditioning for a show and we needed guys to audition. So I called him and was like “I’ll pick you up and take you home if you come audition for this show” so we did that. After the audition we went to dinner together. We joked and caught up and he was really flirty. Like I’ve been both friendship him and flirty him. There’s a major difference. So on the car ride home he had sang to me one of my favorite musical songs and ah it was great. I drop him off and he’s like “sorry if I’m awkward, but we should totally do that again.” So he left and I drove home really confused ( bc I can’t take hints ). So the next day I sent out Snapchat streaks with a sad face, hoping for him to ask me what was wrong. He asked me what was wrong. i told him that I was getting mixed signals from someone and I wasn’t sure how to go about it. Then we asked each other who we liked. We were both reluctant to answer that question so we set a time that we’d send out to each other and tell each other our crushes. BOOM it was each other. So yeahhhhh we both liked each other. So the next day the CAST LIST comes out and in the show we were each other’s love interests. Yay! Not really... anyway so we both decide that it’s not best to date during a show especially if we’re love interest bc then personal matters will get in the way of acting ( bc he breaks my heart in the show and kisses another character. ) 

So even though we said we weren’t gonna date we still hung out. Went to the movies. Met each other’s families. Got close with each other’s families. He was the first guy I kissed/had a physical and emotional attraction to while talking to them. We spent my birthday and 4th of July together. He’s super cute and I really like him. Maybe even love him but I’m not gonna go that far. So about 2 weeks before the show opened I went over to his house ( just me, him and his little brother ) so we put his brother to sleep ( he’s 3 ). We went to his bedroom and put Netflix on. I fell asleep, so did he. We woke up when his brother woke up and came in the room. So we put the TV on in the living room then we went back to the bedroom. So like we started to kiss. Blah blah blah. Fun stuff and we got close to what could’ve turned into sex but we didn’t bc im ‘saving myself for marriage’ I’m really saving myself for the right person. Idk if that him yet. So yeah remember we’re not dating through all of this. So that sums up that day.  soooo fast forward to the next couple of days

It was super awkward between us bc like oof. We didn’t show any signs that we liked each other to the cast bc it’d cause drama ( I did eventually ). So a few days later I go to a choir camp and he doesn’t talk to me at all. He told me afterwards it was bc if something that isn’t in front of him he tends to not think about. I understand that. Most guys are like that. So we continue talking blah blah blah. 

Show week. He doesn’t talk to me at all. Well have small conversations. Backstage and like hug but nothing like we used to. So my ‘bff’ lets go with Y. She comes over with my other close friend Z (Y is borderline cheating on her bf with Z )  and were watching anime. I’m texting my best friend ( from other story ) about how I’m third wheeling. So Y looks over my shoulder and reads a text about my best friend saying she’s cheating. Btw who the fuck reads someone else’s texts over their shoulder without permission? Whatever. So Y calls P to come pick her up from MY house. Then P gets mad at me bc Y ranted to her about how I was telling my best friend. ( I understand it was wrong I’ve apologized and completely understand it was wrong ) so that created a rift between P and I. So couple days later they’re over it. Then there’s rumors that P and Y liked each other. Remember Y is one of my best friends. I confronted them about it and they both cleared it up but they said they thought they had feelings. I cried bc I was hurt. Blah blah blah. We had one more show to do after I found out. So I acted like nothing happened for the sake of the show. All went well with performances but you could tell they both felt horrible. I talked to them and acted normal. So we do strike and P leaves I tell him bye and to let me know when he’s home. He did. Then he hasn’t had a full conversation with since then. 

We’re supposed to date after the show but he hasn’t talked to me and when we do talk it’s very short. I’m scared he won’t want anything to do with me. I think he just thinks he fucked up and that I’m mad. But in reality i forgave him and Y ( partially her ) and I just wanna talk to him. I miss him. 

Not gonna lie. I’m hurt. It makes me a sad bc I really like this person. Maybe even love. I think he’s taking time from the cast to see if everything is a matter of constant exposure. I don’t want it to end bc I love his family and my family loves him. He is super kind and respectful of my boundaries. I’ve gave many of my firsts to him. I don’t regret it bc he’s a great person. I’m just afraid he’s no longer interested. I don’t wanna be hurt or heart broken. We were dating but it still meant a lot to me. 

Sorry this is written all over the place I tried to fit everything in here. 

Anyway if y’all have any advice I would really appreciate it. Thank you.",relationship_advice

She regularly has to look after me when my parents are busy, so we're close, but she's always been touchy with me. The last few weeks she likes massaging my shoulders and back area to ""help relieve stress"" and she's done it maybe 3-4 times, and I let her because I don't like arguing with her and she gets mad easily. I was watching TV on the lounge last night and she said I should lay down cause it would make it easier, which I said I didn't want, but she insisted. She did it like normal but also my lower back and started touching my butt. I asked her to stop and she said ""it's fine, I'm just helping you."" and kept going. I asked her to please stop because I was really uncomfortable and she sort of slowed then stopped.

I thought about it today and I think it was definitely sexual and I feel very uncomfortable. Is this common? I don't want to overreact but I'm worried that she's trying to do something wrong that I clearly don't want.",relationship_advice

I'm M16, she's F16  
Dating for about 3 years, keeping it on the down low.   


The story:  
3 years ago, we started our relationship. Shortly after. maybe a month or so, I made the mistake of. accepting a nude vid from one of my classmates. Me, being the perv i am, watched it. It got to the point of her offering me sex, which i declined. I held back on telling my gf, and told her a year later.   


That raised some issues. it took a year to finally stop. talking about it. arguing over it.   


Her mother is abusive. Verbally. always calls her useless, horrid, irresponsible, among other things.   


All of this has made her have a very low self esteem. Is she good enough for me. is she the girl her mom thinks and says she is.   
She compares herself to others constantly. Doesn't really. believe my compliments

&amp;#x200B;

It hurts guys. I can't do anything to help her. My words seem to do nothing. As we speak, she's revealed she has again started comparing herself again. Has gone as far as looking the 1st mentioned girl's insta to see what she looked like. We're fucking arrguing about the same things we argued the first time again. Even if im trying to diffuse the situation.   
It just seems to never end.   


I always blame myself.  I took that first step 3 years ago, had i not. What would be different?  


Today it continues, even with a mutual friend. Gf looked up to her, still does, but now she's. observing friend's actions and way of dressing, etc.   


How can i hurt less? How can i help her?

t3_chflby,"I'm [28F] falling for my roommate [29M], except...","First off, some context. Let's call the roommate I'm falling for, Mr.A \[29M\]. And please forgive me if I did anything wrong, literally my 2nd ever post on Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; I rent from a friend who owns the house I'm living in currently.

\&gt; Friend delegates me to handle all the renting business. IE. Finding new roommates, or anything that goes on in the house really. So in a sense, I'm sorta an 'acting landlord' for the other people that lives with me.

\&gt; I'm in a poly relationship.

\&gt; The roommate's girlfriend \[29F\] actually suggested Mr.A to have a poly relationship, basically encouraged him to go seek a third partner for himself.

&amp;#x200B;

So, about a month or two ago, the new couple moved in (Mr.A &amp; his Gf). Everything is pretty chill, everybody gets along, basically same age give or take. At this point in time, I'm on and off looking for a new partner, but nothing good really comes up.

About a week ago? I suddenly felt it, a strange odd familiar feeling. // The current relationship I'm in, is on going, and started about 2 years ago. // I started to notice I have feelings for Mr.A, feelings like, wanting to be closer to him, wanting to be more intimate, etc. I usually got a pretty good head on my shoulder, but this time around, my feelings are a bit chaotic.

He's generally a funny person, lots of meme sharing and what not, just generally enjoyable to be around. But here's the problem, if he were -JUST- my roommate, I probably would've just came out and say my piece, open about my feelings. But in all technicality, I'm his landlord... I handle all the applications that they've signed, I handle their rent as a middle person for my friend (who owns the house + doesn't live here).

I've did my fair bit of research about the whole ""landlord dating tenant"" thing. And most answers I've got were basically - Bad idea, but if you can be mature, and clear about business and pleasure, then go for it.

But since my situation also involves Polyamory relationships on both sides, I'm rather conflicted. Because the justification I told myself was basically - It would just be a casual relationship, where we would share intimacy and goes on dates, and enjoy each other's company, without the serious financial entanglement. And I trust myself to be mature enough, and not have things awkward if we do break up, nor would I ever abuse my power as an 'acting landlord'. 

My girlfriend essentially gave me a no-no, because it's of ethical and boundary issues. (Which I don't get, in the sense that I understand it on paper, but does not see it / feel it / understand it in practice.) And told me, it's just a crush, it'll pass.

&amp;#x200B;

But here I am, stewing in figurative turmoil. I want to share my feelings with him. But should I even do that much?

Or should I just bite the bullet, keep my mouth shut, and wait for the feeling to pass?

t3_chfk4x,I (M18) am in love with my former co-worker (F18) but she doesn't show any interest recently,"Throwaway, don't wanna litter my main.

Also forgive me if I set the commas wrongly, since I am awful doing that. It might also happen that some bits are rambly af, sorry for that too. 

So, as you might have seen in the title I am kinda hopeless. To start off, I met this girl on my compulsory internship, which is 3 months long, a year ago. She has a whole lot more experience than me, which is easy, since I've never really been in a relationship before. I was in a hotel working as a waiter with no one I could really connect with to the full extent. I was told that 1 month in another intern would join me and it was that girl. She was beautiful. Not that it was love at first sight, but damn close to that happening. 

In the beginning it was sort of weird, because neither of us talked much and it made it all the more awkward when she almost set the hotel on fire, which I frankly didn't mind. However, as time went on, we got closer, talked more and joked about our bosses and the shit they sell in the hotel. I even named her slave driver, a name she happily accepted, as she always was commanding people, despite being an intern. I digress. We were quite close, despite being complete opposites. She is quite outgoing and open, whereas I am a complete introvert and insecure. That insecurity stems from a girl, let's call her Jen, whom I used like. My friend promised to wingman me so he invited Jen, me and another girl to watch a movie at his home. But during the whole thing she was quite close to my friend and always giggled when he made a comment. So, I come home when he tells me via text to stop liking Jen, as she confessed to him and he also liked her. That shit broke me. I was a wreck for the next few weeks. While the pain has worn off, the insecurity hasn't. I digress. During the internship she made a bunch of remarks that hinted that she liked me. For example, when I came to work after 5 days of freedom she said ""Hey haven't seen you in years"" to which I replied ""Did you miss me?"" and she relatively earnestly said yes. Or she told that we weren't too far away to have a relationship. She even ended the relationship she was in during that period. I was having very little faith in myself, due to the aforementioned incident, that ended up in me thinking that it were impossible for someone to like someone like me. Anyways, on my last day my father came to get me and we decided to chill in the garden of my dorm. Her shift was over soon, so she decided to drop by and talk for a bit. My dad went on to clean my room when she arrived. We talked about 3 hours about various things and she spent the whole time with me, despite saying things like, I am beat, I can't wait to sleep and so on. In the end, nothing really happened.

We were texting ever since the day I left, but nowadays she'd need 2 weeks to reply and I fear that she doesn't have any interest anymore. This is also shown that whenever I say that I am somewhere near her she declines the offer to do something together.

Was she even into me? Or was I simply reading into this too much? And how can I get her interested in me again, if there is a chance?

Thanks in advance",relationship_advice
t3_chfjq0,"Why is it that when I (23F) can't have someone, I want them; but when I have them, I lose interest very quickly?","Pretty much what the title says. When I can't be with someone, I feel very strongly about them. I need to be with them. I would be so happy with them. I want to do anything I can to be with them. 


Then once I have them in my life, I get annoyed by them and I push myself away from them, and don't want to be touched by them. I convince myself and them that I don't need them, or anyone, and I am better off alone. Then as soon as I am rid of them, I want to get them back again. 


I feel awful. I hurt people. I don't mean to. I really do feel very strongly about the person and then it flips very quickly.

t3_chhzss,"I (26M) am ""not doing my part in keeping the apartment clean"" according to my significant other (26F).","I will try to keep this as objective as possible as my girlfriend obviously did not have a say in this. 

Let me start off by saying my gf definitely does more cleaning than I do; there is no denying that on my part. She takes pride in cleaning things 100% and keeps the apartment incredibly tidy. However, this is not to say that I do not regularly clean as well. One of us either cleans the dishes while the other wipes down the counters/sprays them with cleaning agent every night we cook. Again, this is totally fair to me. 

My typical responsibilities consist of taking trash/recycling out about 80% of the time, folding our laundry about 60% of the time, and cleaning the sink/toilet in the bathroom about 90% of the time. I do not need to be told to when to do laundry or take out the trash or wash the dishes as I have done these things growing up. For the bathroom, she does have to ask me to clean it about every 2-3 weeks with a couple days notice (I do not instinctively clean the bathroom). I could do a better job in remembering to clean the bathroom on my own for sure. 

Things she does that I amount to doing more of the cleaning overall: vacuuming the apartment (I am almost never home when she does this and she has never asked me to), scrubbing the tub and cleaning the shower curtains, and generally picking up on things that I honestly do not notice/get bothered by (e.g., crumbs on the couch, dust bunny on the floor, wrapper under the couch). As for the last part, I definitely create more crumbs and occasional wrappers than she does, but by no means am I a slob.

Tonight I cleaned the entire bathroom (floors cleaned in addition to wiping down all surfaces), as she had asked me to do some time this week. Well, I did not scrub the tub/wash the shower curtain and when she asked if I had was clearly frustrated I had not. I told her that I am willing to and always will clean, but I get annoyed at the way she presents these things to me as if ""ohh, of course you should have also cleaned the tub, we are having friends over this weekend."" This may be the case for her mind but certainly is not for mine. So I told her that I am never naturally going to clean the apartment as much as she does/wants to as I have a lower standard for what is clean compared to her. She said this is not fair bc we split the mess, if not more of it is created by me (""I would clean 25% as much if you did not live here!""). And now we are in a fight over this.

Additional info: Sometimes she will ask me to clean something and I am not enthused to go clean the bathroom right away; certainly something I could work on as I may be snappy occasionally when she asks.  Anytime someone comes over to our apartment, they comment how nice/clean our apartment is. We have a really nice, clean apartment and this is something that we both take pride in. I mention this as it is not like our apartment is ever any where to close to what I or most other people would consider to be dirty/messy.

So can anyone give some advice on how we resolve this going forward? Anyone experience a similar situation? We have a fantastic, committed relationship and this will not impact us long term, but it seems like every couple months there is a fight over cleaning.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My girlfriend is naturally very clean and tidy. So am I, but not to the same level as she is. I would say I do about 40% of the cleaning overall, including the things she admittedly does not like to do as much (i.e., take out trash, clean toilet, wash dishes).  She wants me to do more w/o her having to remind me. This occasionally leads to a fight.",relationship_advice
t3_ch0zmv,Tired of mothering my long term boyfriend.,"I really need a space to complain.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for six years now. We met online when we were pretty young. I was 16 and living on the east coast, he was 19 living on the west coast. We did 5 years of long distance during this time, and I finally packed up and moved my entire life to be with him after I graduated college and landed a job on the west coast.

I love him dearly. He’s my best friend and there’s no one else I’d rather be with. But, no matter how much I love him, I can’t get over the fact that he’s essentially a man child. He got upset with me today for ‘mothering him’, and I can’t say that he’s wrong. I do. That’s on me. But the laundry list of immature behaviors is getting longer and it’s starting to become unbearable.

He’s turning 26 next week, and since we’ve moved in together, he hasn’t paid rent once. He works eight hours a week on average, but refuses to go back into the service industry because it’s beneath him (he graduated from college six months ago). He’s also in a mountain of debt (both student debt and credit card debt). I understand all of these things, but bills are bills, dude! Get back in there!

I’ve tried to be really supportive and understanding of his situation and not contributing to the rent, but 13 months! What the hell?

He refuses to adopt basic behaviors of self care. By that I mean- washing your face, trimming your pubes, cutting your fingernails, seeing a doctor, taking medications, signing up for health insurance when you age out- those kinds of things. It’s terrible, but I feel so shallow for caring! Unconditional love, right? I don’t expect him to work out every day or anything. It would just be nice if he’d eat a vegetable. Or not demolish a few grams of weed and a 12 pack of beer every day and a half.

These little things pile up and become turns offs, and I’ve noticed that I’m much less sexually attracted to him than I used to be. It sucks, because lately I’ve been realizing how big the world is. I’m not a model, and certainly don’t consider myself more attractive than most people, but I’ll get attention from really attractive guys and girls and feel a pang of guilt because I know that I could be with someone who makes a little more effort. Lately, it seems like a lot of people have been pointing that out to me.

The other day, my coworker asked how long we’d been together, and I told her. She said “Wow, isn’t it time to move on?”. I got a little defensive, but secretly I saw where she was coming from. People used to smile when I told them how long my boyfriend and I had been together, but the last year in particular has been met with more looks of pity than anything else. We get asked why we’re not married all the time. To be fair, he’s told me it’s something he’d like to do right, but he doesn’t have the money for it right now. I don’t mind, and I’m not really in a rush to get married either at 23. His aunt cornered me a couple of months ago to ask a million questions about why we weren’t married, why he hadn’t proposed yet, why this, why that. It was humiliating.

I feel like I can’t tell him any of these things because they would hurt his feelings or damage his ego. He has pretty low self esteem so it would feel like betrayal, even if I were gentle about it. So instead, I mother the guy. It sucks. I feel guilty, and I feel guilty for saying all of this. I’ll probably delete it later, I just really needed a space to let it all out.

I loved her beyond all measure and pushed for long distance, but she wouldnt take it. Instead, she took the first dude she met and thought it alright to tell me she missed me endlessly and lead me on. 

I cut her out, but honestly some part of me would be willing to take that backburner role while she gets her running done. 

For my own self esteem and mental health though, I told her how I felt and said I'd rather be put first. She said she couldn't, but she wishes she could. She said she wants me, but she doesnt want me until shes truly sure. 

I feel like the bad guy for cutting her out, but I truly feel like what she was saying was not at all romantic like she tried to say it was. In my eyes i just felt like i was being on cheated on. 

I guess this is kind of an AMITA because I feel really bad for cutting her off entirely. 

I think I did the right thing, but I second guess myself on the daily as that was the girl I wanted to marry heart &amp; soul.

t3_chhxrx,Should I(20M) tell my to be girlfriend(21F) about the other ladies that have been in my life during her absence.,"So I met this girl named Lexi (21F) via a friend and we hit it off. We got along great and we had a very strong physical connection. I thought that we were headed towards a great relationship. However, while discussing one of our mutual friends relationship, she started talking about how she did not want a relationship and that she really enjoyed the dating scene in our area (Northern Texas). This was understandable because she just recently got out of a relationship when we started talking. At this point, I decided that I liked things how they were and I curbed my plan to ask her to be my girlfriend. 

Things continued on like this for about two months but then her employer gave her the opportunity to travel to New York to work on a project for about 3 months. I encouraged her to take it because it sounded like the opportunity of a life time and I thought that it would be very beneficial for her. She accepted it and was gone the next week. At this point, she had been on dates with about two other guys. I do not know if they were physical at all. 

Over the next week we both talked about how much we miss the other, but then she said that I should have just asked her to be my girlfriend. I was shocked and a little annoyed because she always talked about how she likes being single and how she does not want to be in a relationship. I was told that "" I was her exception"". She said if I am still single when she gets back then she would definitely want a relationship. She informed me that she had no intention of dating/talking to any guys in New York because she would be very busy with her project. When I asked her what she expected of me, she said that she expects nothing as she did not want to impede my happiness or stop me from meeting someone that is great for me. About two or three weeks later, the overall tone of our texting conversations had shifted. We now send each other a Good Morning or Good Night text with a kissy emoji or we talk about how much we mean to each other. She comes home in three days but there is a problem, I have seen two other girls in her three month absence. 

Girl #1:  (19F): We talked for about a week and hung out with each other pretty much everyday. We had sex twice. After a week, I did not respond to a one of her texts and we stopped talking. I never felt anything towards her. I think I was just board and not thinking my decisions through.

Girl #2: : (18F):She gave me her snapchat while I was at work and we snapped for a few days before I invited her to a kickback me and my friends were hosting.  We started making out ( we were both sober), and proceeded to go back to my room and have sex. Again, not thinking things through. All conversations with her stopped after that night.

 My time with Girl#1 only made me realize how much I missed Lexi. I only had sex with girl #2 because I got wrapped up  in the moment and I was pretty horny. It is crucial to know that both of these interactions happened within the first month and a half of Lexi's absence.  I have practically not even looked at a woman since. 

So my question is, should I tell Lexi about my encounters with the two girls? I know that we were not officially dating, but we are practically committed to date upon her arrival. There is practically a zero percent chance of her finding out about the two girls and everyone I have talked to about it  has told me not to tell her. I see their point, but I also want to enter in to a relationship with her being 100% truthful and forthcoming.",relationship_advice

My eyes have been opened as well I’ve changed but I fear it’s too late...,"My boyfriend broke up with me because my insecurity and trust issues was too much for him.

Now that we are back together I am overly aware of how I turned our relationship, that started out as feeling magically meant to be turning it to a hostile place. I’m so regretfully sorry.

t3_chaudt,Dealing with Sameness,"My (21M) girlfriend (23F) asked me if I was content with the ""sameness"" of our relationship.
Background: We've been dating for a little over 7 months. We worked together for a year when I was 19, got along fine, never hung out or spoke at length except maybe once or twice after a shift. I didn't see her for a year until we matched on Tinder. We met up, had a really fun date that only I at the time thought was a date (we had a good laugh about it) but she was supposed to be moving so she didn't want to start a relationship. She was such a cool person though that we became good friends and for an entire year that was it. We hung out a lot either one on one or with a few other people. I went to her house to watch movies with her and her family, and we played video games and smoked pot together. She was hands down the best friend I had, she was cute, and our personalities matched up perfectly. So yeah, I also had a fat crush on her.
A year in and I confess to her because I thought she might feel the same (she did) and we started dating in December. We moved pretty fast; she's an ex jehovah witness so she's never been in a relationship or had sex before me, and a couple months in we started sleeping over at each other's homes, saying I love you all that. 
Shes the girl of my dreams, shes weird and goofy and laid back and just so gosh darn amazing and I feel so lucky to call her my girlfriend. 
Anyway, this morning we're cuddling and she asks me if I'm content, and I tell her yes, I like our relationship. She says she feels like we just do the same things over and over again and she's feeling antsy. I get it, routine can be dull and boring. I think I just got too comfortable with it because we do exactly what I would do if I were single; work, eat, gaming, movies and anime, sleep. One of my fears has always been she would get bored of that, and as an extension me.
I'm not against doing things outside the norm, I love adventures and excitement; I just don't know what shes looking for. I told her I'll make our lives less routine, I just needed some ideas and she didn't say anything. So I'm asking you guys, how do you get your relationships out of ruts and avoid sameness?
P.S. We both work but dont make a whole lot of money. (Probable spend more than people in our financial situation should on drinks and food) So please avoid suggesting a hot air balloon ride or a luxurious spa day.",relationship_advice

I’ve been going out with this amazing girl for the last ~6 months of my life. She makes me laugh, she’s so cute and funny, and makes me an all around better person in every way possible. We have had almost no arguments, get on really well, she is really an amazing girl and I am so lucky to have her in my life. 

I have quite bad anxiety, diagnosed by the doctors, and I used to have it wayyy under control until I got into a relationship. I don’t get to see her that much due to my exams, and because of that my anxiety came back. I get nervous about what she is up to, where she goes; all this worrying stemming from my anxiety.

I also feel weird about what she wears and the stuff she posts on social, she has said repeatedly to me she posts because “people at her school do it too” but her posts, supposedly, show a lot more than her friends do, up to bikini pictures being posted since we’ve been going out (but not before we’ve been going out). I’ve said nothing to her about this; I realise I am horribly insecure about this but I don’t want to be manipulative and tell her what to do as she is her own person and she can do what she wants. I don’t want to be manipulative whatsoever which I wanna avoid which is why I need to get over this insecurity ASAP 

I also feel weird about it as (based on society) she is seen as a LOT more attractive than me, up to people saying “why are you with him haha he’s no where near your league” “how have you pulled her she is FIT” which makes me feel like she could just leave at any point for someone more attractive. 

I’ve voiced some of my insecurities to her and she’s so open to helping me out and I just feel so bad that I feel this way and I wanna get over it as I don’t want it to cripple me :( 

This is my first relationship and I really want this to work and I am horribly insecure and we both know this but I wanna work this out because I really don’t wanna mess this up with this girl cos she really is amazing

Got married when I was 19. I was in a rough financial situation and a wonderful man (26 at the time) fell in love with me. He had a house, a good job. He was a way out. I said yes when he asked me because I didn't have many options. I never stopped my relationship with my deadbeat ex at the time. We kept hooking up for 6 years before the asshole left me after I got pregnant the second time. I have 3 kids. Did the paternity tests on all three (hooked up with a co-worker before 3rd pregnancy). only the firstborn wasn't my husband's. He doesn't suspect a thing and honestly I never meant to hurt him. He's a great man and a great father to all my 3 children. And I've grown to love him over the years. I told my son when he turned 18. He was furious and told asked me not to say anything until he finished college so that he won't be screwed because of my fuck ups. And now he did. With honors. Soon he'll get a job and be independent and more importantly he won't have any crippling debt from his education. It's been way too long and I need to come clean.

t3_chdr5f,"Friend got the wrong idea, but I don’t want to lose him","td;lr at bottom 

Had a sleepover with a friend (M19) last Monday. We had booze, energy drinks, snacks, pizza and horror movies. He paid for everything, even though I offered to pay half, several times.

I never really spoke a lot to him before but 2-3 years later, here we are having a blast. We didn’t really get drunk, maybe a little tipsy at most. He asked if we should sit on his bed and move the tv so we did. I sat up during the whole first movie, while he laid down. I eventually became a bit more comfortable and kind of half laid down/ half sat up next to him. 

At around 3.30AM and 3 horror movies later we turned off the tv and laid down. I didn’t really want to sleep in his brother’s bed and this friend had a big bed. He hesitated before taking his jeans off and then got under the covers. 

We talked until 5AM, where I suddenly felt a bit sick (wonder why) and wanted to sleep. But before that he asked if I was ticklish, so I lied and said no because I didn’t want him to touch me. He says “wow look at all this space” and gestured to the bed because apparently he had crept all the way over to me. He also said “I didn’t think we were gonna be here 3 years ago!” I’m thick skulled I guess, and said “no me neither!” But meant nothing by it. 

My point is, he apparently dropped a lot of hints, meanwhile I picked up on ZERO. We have both had shitty relationships and flirts, and talked a lot about exes etc. I mentioned I had added a guy on Snapchat and was thinking about being fuck buddies. I have had really bad experiences with sex and hoped maybe it could make me feel better about it. (Mistake 1, I guess). I also mentioned a guy who groped me in my sleep and how disgusting and angry it made me feel. (Important later)


He mentioned that mutual friend V and him often cuddled and it was awesome cause it didn’t mean anything. So when we go to sleep he asks if I want to spoon. 

Me: ... uh... why? .. haha

Him: cause it’s chill and nice

I figured it was like with V and said okay. I’m stupid, okay?

I wake up a couple of hours later and he’s hard.. and pressing up against my butt. I thought about it for a few minutes but eventually concluded that no, this guy is not my type at ALL. I could barely look him in the eye so I pretended to be asleep and actually did fall asleep again. He did this three times. The last time I pretended to move and kind of wake up, which made him move away.

I got dressed soon after and he said he had to leave to help his mom. It seemed legit. He also might not be able to hang out Thursday after all. I actually can’t hang out Thursday now, but idk if I should even bring it up.

This dude and I have several mutual friends. It wasn’t until I said it out loud (to a couple of my trusty friends) that I realized, it was kind of disrespectful. I even told him about the other gropey guy and how it made me feel. I’m not mad about it though.

I don’t want to make it awkward in our friend group, but I don’t want him to get the wrong idea either. What do I do here? I actually really like this guy as a friend and don’t want to lose him.

Back about 5 years ago when I was 17 about to turn 18 I had been dating this girl and her father hated me. She was 16 when we got together, I was still 17. We had to sneak around behind his back. Eventually he found out about us and once I turned 18 he had me arrested. Contributing to the delinquency of a minor. We were forced to stop talking. We went our separate ways for a year or 2. In the meantime I went and had a child and kinda never thought we would ever even talk again. She pops back up outta nowhere and it was like things never ended between us. But after a week or 2 she just started being really shady and I called her out on it, told her pretty much I'm not about the bs just keep it real with me and we won't ever argue. She gets heated and cuts me off again. I was pretty upset at the time but got over it quick. Another few months go by and here she comes again. I fall right back in to her. Same shit as last time, all good for a week or 2 and then she's back to the bs. I tell myself this is it, I'm done for good. I cut her off this time. Now, once again, she pops back up 2 weeks ago. She seemed like she had matured a lot and things were better then they ever had been. I go to her place to drink with her and she has a friend there. We all got pretty lit and they asked me to have a threesome with them. I shouldn't have done it but it seemed like we were all having a great time so I said fuck it. Next day everyone is cool, so I'm like ok awesome no hurt feelings. That night we all get lit again and she passed out and her friend and I ended up messing around again. Her friend told me she didn't care so I'm like oh alright she don't care well fuck it. Obviously a dumb move. She calls us out the next morning and I'm like well you don't want a relationship so I mean I can do what I want. She tells me to leave so I do. Day goes by I hear nothing from her. I'm like great I fucked up this time. But she came back over yesterday and is acting like everything is fine. I really don't know what to do from here. I'm sure some will judge my decisions but it is what it is. I want to be with this girl but I feel like a combination of her shadyness and my dumb decisions has kinda ruined any chance of that. Should I just leave her alone for good? Me and her have such a past but I didn't feel like all the details where needed but if anyone would like to know you can pm me. I really love her and want the best for her even if the best isn't me.",relationship_advice
t3_chfemr,my (19f) boyfriend (21m) of one year has never cum during sex. is this normal?,"hi everyone. i will try and keep this as short as possible because i hate writing long paragraphs on my phone. 

so my boyfriend and i have been together for over a year. everything is great and i consider him my best friend. he seems to like taking things slow, i mean very very slow. by example, he’s never said i love you yet. i’ve said it to him, but when he didn’t express the same feeling i felt really embarrassed and ashamed. i haven’t said it since.

so as the title says, my bf has not **once** cum during sex. we have sex around 5 times a week and i try very hard to please him but he can only get off if he jerks himself to cum. i’ve only ever asked him once why this was the case, because i can’t help but think it’s my fault and i’m not pleasing him. he responded very angrily (maybe embarrassed? i dunno) and said he was just really sensitive or something. i asked if he had death grip and he said no because he doesn’t really masturbate alone. 

when we have sex, it’s fun for the first few minutes but then i get tired and sore and it becomes a chore because it will last around 30-45 minutes before he calls it quits and jerks off to cum. 

i really worry im not good in bed, or that he doesn’t like the way i do things? it makes me feel kinda insecure. is this normal? also how should i approach this topic with him without making him feel angry/embarrassed? any tips on how to make sex more enjoyable for the both of us?

thanks all",relationship_advice
t3_chfe3k,"Girlfriend (23F) ""on the verge"" of breaking up with me (20F), what do I do? How do I handle myself?","I've been dating this girl since June of last year, we met working together last year's New Year. I have never felt so loved, understood, accepted and cared for in this past year. She used to go out of her way to be with me, go out, etc. and she would always surprise me with many different meals, experiences, etc.

We still work together, at a different, charitable establishment that we are both passionate about (one of the reasons we bonded so quickly). She moved up to a managing position throughout this past year (I'm newer on the project, she is on occasion managing me, but not quite).

In recent weeks, she's been distant. We live in separate houses, though I sometimes go over after a long day at work, or just when I miss her. She's been a safe space too, since I still live some family (single parent, siblings- she just lives with roommates), and I sometimes have family issues that cause me stress. We made a deal not too long ago that I won't go over too often because she really values her alone time- as do I.

As she recently began a managing position- a big step up in her life, I understand she is very stressed during this time. She also studies languages, reads frequently, does yoga and various workout sessions in her spare time, which she takes very seriously as a day to day routine. Though more recently, she's been very focused on that, and I have felt as if she is not as invested in me- not as she used to be, anyways. Not that I'm expecting her to show up with flowers when I see her, she does still very much care for me, but she's been distant.

We had planned a trip that I was really looking forward to for a few months- my friend and her boyfriend invited us. It was due next month, but I saw she didn't request the days off, and I could have sworn that the many times I asked her she was excited, but she told me she doesn't want to go. I understood. She instead planned a trip in a different city for herself the same week. This upset me as I just heard about it- and have been telling her I have been wanting to go there for a while. She told me she would pay for the trip we initially planned but doesn't want to go as she doesn't want to be around my friend and her boyfriend, she doesn't like the idea of the trip (which I had thought she did), and just in general , wants to be alone. I understood, but it hurt me.

I saw her this morning and we talked for our relationship. She told me she believes we have different goals and outlooks on life, and that she doesn't want to hang around me when she just wants to be alone, but she doesn't want to upset me either. I told her I respect her, but she has been so great to me when most other aspects of my life have let me down- and I feel in this past year, she has helped me grow as we shared feelings and experiences together. She told me she doesn't think she likes being in a relationship in general, it's too stressful for her to constantly care about someone, and that she just enjoys being alone. This is her first relationship, and my second. I asked her if she still wanted to be together, her response was ""maybe."" (after hesitation)

This is very sudden and I don't know how to feel. Our conversation ended there as we were talking over breakfast but she had to go to work (I knew this).  It feels sudden because a month ago, we were expressing so much love for each other, we planned things, went on nice dates and she was so great to me. Even earlier this week, she was asking if I was coming over, and I was planning a home-cooked meal and a relaxing night for the two of us.

I have been hurt, let down, and let go by many people, family included. This hurts more, though, because this is the most I have loved and been loved back, and the most care and understanding I have had reciprocated. It's hard to have someone care for me so much, and then all of a sudden say that they just want to be alone in life. I still love her, and she says she loves me but that I need someone who can be more ""there"" for me and listen to me more, and be as excited about life and other people as I am. I just miss how it used to be.

I respect her feelings and choices. I'm not asking for advice on how to save a relationship- frankly, I don't understand where we stand right now, anyways. I just don't know what to do, how to feel, or what to say in general. I feel like I have been wasted, I feel uncared for, I wish I had spent more time with her when things were the way they were before. I wish I didn't ask her about this trip in the first place. I can't even do things by myself as I am younger, and significantly smaller (we have a foot difference in height). I'm not even going on this trip anymore since I only wanted to go and experience it with her, not with my friend and her boyfriend.

It's difficult because we work together as well, and by all means, we maintain a professional work environment, but it would be difficult to see her. I'm moving to a different project in the next month or two, anyways, but for now we will still see each other at work often. We both work full-time.

I just don't know what to do. I just feel terrible- I don't feel like eating, sleeping, going to work. I feel stressed and alone.",relationship_advice
t3_chhub7,I [21m] hate when my girlfriend [20f] of two years goes out/parties and it is straining our relationship,"Looking for any sort of help/advice because I don't particularly like that my relationship is strained because of this since it is otherwise great. For context both of us are in school/college/university. I have one-ish year left and has two. We're technically long-distance throughout the year as our schools are separated by a 1.5-2hr ish drive but we still see each other regularly. 

My girlfriend has always enjoyed going out / partying while I hate it (I used to enjoy it to a degree and go out often when I was 17-19. I, admittedly, only did it to hook up with people though). I really don't like parties, bars, etc. Festivals are ok. Weddings/formals/etc. are fine, too. I also hate dealing with drunk people. Further, another flaw of mine is that I judge people who go out often, even though I know logically it makes no sense. If people go out a lot I start to dislike/not respect them - unfortunately my girlfriend is a person who likes to go out a lot.

She goes out with her friends to 3-5 nights a week and sometimes day-drinks during the school year. On breaks she'll still go out but a lot less so. If I'm with her she invites me out. I hate when she goes out or drags me with her (if I say no a lot she'll get annoyed w/ me - which is reasonable). I think it's grimy and every single time she sends me some dumb ass drunk text/snap it makes me respect her less. I think it's vapid and basic. I have no concerns/doubts that she's cheating so I guess I'd like to get that off of the table because I know someone is bound to suggest it or something related to that. 

Otherwise our relationship is great, and I know this is a *100% me problem* as going out is a total normal and respectable thing. I should not have these feelings towards people who go out often and I definitely shouldn't have them towards her. I'd like to not think my girlfriend is vapid/basic every time she does. She doesn't know I feel this way about her going out, either - I've never brought it up in a conversation/argument. I'm not exactly looking for advice on how to fix our relationship, but how to fix me, as this shouldn't be something that bothers me but it does. I'm not going to ask her to stop going out (because that's totally unfair) and I'm not going to break up with her over this (because that's dumb and also unfair). 

Thanks.

**tl;dr:** I judge my girlfriend when she goes out with her friends/drinks and it makes me respect her a lot less. Otherwise relationship is good. She does not know I hate it. Want to not respect her less for going out/drinking as it is wrong/doesn't make sense for me to feel that way.",relationship_advice
t3_chfcl5,My (25M) girlfriend (26F) hasn't invited me to her friends birthday. I am upset,"We have been together for 7 months now, we are already official. She has already met most of my friends in two gathering occasions. I haven't met her friends yet.


She will attend this birthday in some fancy bar for rich people and she did not mention to invite me yet, which I am counting she won't because usually this should be one the first things to do if a party is confirmed IMO. At least this is what I do.


I feel upset...could be a girls night out and could be not, anyway, it is just a social gathering in a bar...


I can't hide my emotions and when something is bothering me my actions and expressions gives away. I like parties and we are recently official, so it is all new the meeting of both social circles and parties...

We were set to hang out tomorrow for some beers and food but now she will shop for clothes and I refused to join her.

t3_chfcgu,"24M still likes my (26F) stuff on social media, but won’t directly talk to me?","Talked to this guy for about 1.5 years on social media.  We live in separate states. When it came to meet, he didn’t feel confident, said still figuring out his career, himself, backed out. I was incredibly, incredibly heartbroken. 

Forward 1 year- I distanced myself because I felt embarrassed; we’ve drifted apart since. He lost all his muscle, lost weight.  When I talk to him, his replies are very dead-ended, brief. Once in awhile he’ll strike up a effort-ful conversation. 

I’ve been avoiding social media because when I post something, he’s one of the first to like/see what I post.  

My mom said to not think of it as anything. Sometimes people like/click stuff just to click it.  It has no deeper meaning.  

Any ideas why he still checks/likes my stuff on social media? Also, what should I do?  

I guess I can block him.  I still like him a lot, but I’ve accepted nothings gonna happen.  Hurts, but this is not a way to live life 😂",relationship_advice
t3_chfb70,I (23f) have been in a LDR with my bf (22) for almost two years. Family is nervous about me moving and I'm not sure how to handle it,"I'm European, he's from the US. We met online and everything is going fine. We love each other's company and when we talk about the future of our relationship we're both taking it very seriously. However, I am currently studying for my bachelor's degree that I'm going to finish in 2 years and if I decide to study for Master's (which I most likely will, but I'm not 100% sure yet) that'll be two more years (4 in total) until we can start working on ""closing the distance"".
 It was always kinda given that I'd be the one moving there, since I speak the language fluently and given my field of study I'd have way more opportunities there as opposed to my small home country. But the longer we're together the more upset my parents (especially dad) get, asking when is he going to move ""home"" (to my country), implying that they absolutely expect him to be the one to move, how I have such a good background and support at home (which is true tbh) and how it'd be a shame to throw it all away. 
Since I'm going to be in school for quite a while still, we don't have any definite plan yet which makes it hard to talk to my family about it. When I answer their questions with ""I don't know yet"", they think I'm being rude or dishonest. 
And don't get me wrong, I understand why they'd be upset, but I'm worried about dad especially causing a lot of drama. He told me once that since he still financially supports me - which was his decision and it's very common where I live- that I am supposed to ask for his permission about everything. I was 22 at the time and he was mad that I told him, rather than asked if I was allowed first, that I was visiting my bf for 3 weeks after my exams were done. I have a part time job and I would never ask him for money for that. He's pretty protective/controlling (other people's words, not mine. I grew up in it and never really realized that)
So, how do I deal with my family members (parents, grandparents, aunts etc) question me, often in front of the rest of the family, about my future plans, sometimes hinting how terrible I'd be if I ever moved away? What do I tell them so I stay polite but also don't lie to them?
And somewhat unrelated question I have would be how long in advance is it reasonable to plan moving to another country and possibly getting married? I know that visa applications take forever to get processed and moving to another continent is probably no joke.


Tl,dr:
I'm in a long distance serious relationship and after I finish school in 2 or 4 years (depends on degree) I will likely be the one moving. Family, especially dad, is unhappy that I found someone from far away and are asking me questions I don't know the answers for yet (the when's and how's) and hinting I'd be a terrible daughter if I ever moved away. I don't know how to stay honest and polite when talking to them since they all disagree with me moving away in the first place. 

I tried to make it short and failed. Thanks to anyone who has read the whole thing :)

t3_chhsa0,How do I (21M) get my ex (21F) to take down a fake account about me made after we broke up?,"How do I (21M) get my ex (21F) to take down a fake account about me made after we broke up?

I broke up with this girl, let’s call her X, 7 months ago. I recently found out that she had made an Instagram account, with a picture of me, and under the description she trashed me. 

I was only wit her for the short term investment. The only rewarding thing that came out of the relationship was her willingness to do sexually and emotionally satisfy me. The negative attributes of the relationship was that she had no social skills. She had trouble starting up and continuing conversations. She opened up a lot to me and had told me very-personal things about herself, and her last relationship. Her last ex dumped her the night he had taken her virginity, and left her outside alone. Also, about losing her friends, and not being able to openly talk to her family about her problems. She had a lot of issues to begin with, and seemed to really fall in love with me throughout our relationship. 

I’ve been with my ex (current gf) for 4 years, which beats out being in relationship with X for 7 months. So, when my ex came running back to me 6 months ago, I obviously had to take her back. I was in love with my gf, and not X, but X was in love with me. 

In the post it implied I was a manipulating sociopath who mentally and sexually abused her. At the end of a date she was willing to have sex with me. After we would have sex she would have to walk back alone. I couldn’t, because I had to wake up early for school the next morning.

I did have some feelings for her, but that was before my ex (current gf) came back into the picture. So this claim of mental and sexual abuse is a lie. She wouldn’t even have evidence to show it either. 

It is not my fault she fell in love with me and I had no intentions of feeling the same way. I saw our relationship short term when I had to choose between her and my current gf. When I had the opportunity to go back to my ex, who I was actually in love with, of course I dumped X to go with the one I actually loved. 

I did feel a little bad that I dumped her the way her first ex did, which was sleeping with her, then dumping her, and letting her walk home alone. But after she made that fake account trying to call me out I don’t feel bad for her. I want to move on with my girlfriend, and I don’t want this thing to suddenly come up again  in the future. I dumped X and I have no remorse, and my gf thinks I shouldn’t feel bad either. I don’t think I deserve hate for breaking up with someone I don’t love. How do I get her post taken down?",relationship_advice
t3_chhr9i,what to do when pst mistakes are affecting my future?!,"  

When I was 16 I fell in love…..everyone would hope that would be the forever after. What do you do when you realise at 19 that your fiancé is a paedophile and most likely was only with you because you looked younger. My partner decided 1.5 months before our wedding to sleep with another women, in our flat (I was at my parent´s  house, for reasons that are not important here). My Fianceé impregnated this woman, and told me about a month before the wedding. We had been through many issues before this, but since I was very “Christian” and we were engaged from before I was 17 I felt it was my duty to support the man I had said I would love. I am now 34 years old, and I still feel like I am dealing with this. I realise that when I write this others will want to know about the paedophile thing, but I just cannot deal with writing about it. I have been in other relationships, but except for one the men have always cheated, Now I feel that I am only attracted to women, I do not feel that there is anything wrong with this. I am just worried that I am trying to protect myself against more pain from men. What do you all think? Is this a defence mechanism?",relationship_advice
t3_chhr5e,Family members have invited themselves to an out-of-town event that I don't want them at.,"Brother-In-Law (my SO's brother) &amp; his family have travelled from their state to our state to stay at an out of town VRBO cabin with us for the last two years. We started going because of a dance workshop I attend annually. It's a 4-5 day trip, and the event ends with a community show that welcomes the public. During the workshop, my SO hangs out with them, fishing, UTV riding, etc.




The problem is that BIL drinks heavily &amp; is a sexist douche-canoe when he drinks. The first year, he made disgusting comments about ""camel-toes"" about a dancer while her family was seated directly behind &amp; could hear. We shushed him, other people came over to shush him, he got lots of stank eye, but he continued. He then came to the after party &amp; hit on my friends &amp; disparaged his fiance who had gone back to the cabin to sleep. 




Last year, same story. I felt I was giving him a second chance in allowing him to come - although they invited themselves. During the performance he loudly made fun of a good friend while she danced; calling her overweight, to put it nicely. I stood up, said we were done &amp; we all left the event. He was butt-hurt &amp; mopey, but I didn't care. I never yelled, and I tried to be an adult about it to preserve family harmony.  He asked why we left &amp; I simply said ""I had a headache."" I figured I'd talk to him privately when he was 100% sober, but that never happened. 




Today, he texted me to find out details on the trip this year. I put my foot down with my SO last year; he cannot come to my dance events. He is not invited. What do we do to save family peace?",relationship_advice
t3_chhqn9,[17M] am I being ghosted because generally have no idea,So basically there’s this girl I like and she likes me back and we were planning to go on a date in a week and basically she’s on vacation atm.

The next day I try to text her no response on Snapchat or Instagram yet she’s sending streaks but it’s just black no picture and big S which means streak and not of her or vacation place or something. The next day i say hey again both on Snapchat and Instagram again but no response and she sends basically the same streak again so I’m confused because she didn’t have any service issues before and she’s sending streaks which means she has service and I checked on maps just to see where she is and it saids she still at the place she’s been on vacation on so I’m really confused if I’m being ghosted. Also she hasn’t read or opened my streaks nor my attempts to talk to her.,relationship_advice
t3_chhqcb,I [28m] got too attached too quickly to her [21f],"Ok, so to start, I don't have alot of romantic experience and up to this point, that combined with my low self esteem has basically made every relationship I've had be pretty 1-sided. I recently left a relationship on good/mutual terms with someone, but I wasn't feeling great overall emotionally and I met this new girl online.  


She's from another country, and we became very emotionally attached to each other very quickly, based on some similar feelings about certain things and I guess because she had had some bad experiences and I was the first guy who didn't do/say certain things to her that other guys had. I realize that's super vague, but basically, we immediately got crazy attached, talked for hours and hours over a few days, even to the point of me almost buying her something crazy expensive and her almost buying a plane ticket to come see me. I guess what I like/liked most about her was that my insecurities didn't bother her in the slightest and I just latched onto her because I was in the mindset of ""well she likes me, so I should like her back"" and I DO like some of her qualities, but there's one big dealbreaker related to sex and also some other small things that make me know I can't continue the relationship with her.  


We've had one conversation about that, and she says she understands, and she says shes just assumed that if we did meet up and continue our relationship, that she would just let me fill my needs elsewhere, which I hate the thought of. Now, I can tell from our conversation that the more we talked about being just friends, the more upset she was getting and she said she thinks she should just be alone, and not try dating anymore because other guys have had the same reservations about the thing I do.   


I realize this has been a crazy ramble, but I guess my question is: is there a way to make her feel better? I feel like a terrible person for this, as if I've led her on somehow, even though she says she doesn't think I have. I just want her to be happy and find someone who is right for her, even though that isn't me.",relationship_advice
t3_chalo3,I [26M] told a girl [25F] I’ve been seeing that I’m “all in with her.” She replied by saying she doesn’t know what she wants.,"Hello. As the title states, I’ve been seeing this girl for about a month. Through this span, we’ve been on 4 official dates and have been talking almost non stop the entire time. She’s a RN and works night shifts, so sometimes her schedule can be opposite of mine but we’ve both made genuine effort to see and talk to each other when we can.

As a background for us both, we both had long term relationships with our past ex (me - 1 year, her- 3 years). These ex relationships supposedly ended early this year or late last year, so there’s been a good amount of time before us meeting and we’ve both have been casually dating since. Both of us were broken up with and our ex’s are now official dating other people.  

Well, last night was our 4th date. Before this, we had done the typical dinner meet n greet (met online) and have done some fun activities for others. Our 4th date, however, was planning to go see a movie and then agreed to come back to my place for drinks and to kick back. When she came back to my place, we were physical for the first time and ended up having sex. She was very into it and was I, as it was pretty passionate. 

This morning I felt pretty confident that this relationship could definitely lead to something. So when I texted her this morning after a bit of talking I brought up something about a potential future. Basically I said that I was “all in” with her, where there wasn’t going to be any distractions or talking to other people and that she has my full attention. Period, that’s it. I even pointed out that I wasn’t wanting to jump in to anything, but more so to keep an open dialogue because I really did like her and didn’t want there to be confusion. Unfortunately, her response was not ideal. She mentioned that she loves hanging out with me and even pointing out the sex was fantastic. But she still needs time to figure things out and that for her feelings are taking some time to develop. She mentioned that she hasn’t been this close to a relationship for a long time and she wants to be 100% sure it’s something she wants before making that step. She asks that we keep seeing each other and she will let me know what she decides. 

When I read that I was actually pretty struck. She in no way had shown signs of disinterest. But now that interest levels aren’t the same, I’m unsure what to do at this point. Do I save face and just keep dating her and could potentially deal with the inevitable of getting rejected? Did I bring up intense feelings too soon? I’m just kind of lost on how to approach or handle this as obviously I do like her enough but also now know I can’t be pushy and will have to pull back. It’s just sort of thrown off the pace. Please help..

TL;DR - Been on handful of dates with a girl and just had sex. Says she doesn’t know what she wants after saying I’m giving her all of my attention. Not sure how to move forward with the situation.",relationship_advice

t3_chhp8m,My GF asked if I would pay her bills so that she can quit her current job and start looking for another job that would make her happier,"Me (M 31) and my girlfriend (F 31) have been together for about 2 and a half years. Today while on a phone call she was telling me she is thinking of quitting her job because she is getting tired of it. She said she is thinking of being a freelancer because that will allow her to have a more flexible schedule since she is not a morning person. She said she is unhappy that she has to wake up every day in the morning and go to work a job she does not even like.

I said that it's fine she wants to work somewhere else but that it wouldn't be as reliable as her current job and that maybe she would struggle to pay her bills. She asked in a cute voice if I would be willing to pay for her bills so that she can try to look for her dream job. It was a hypothetical question since I am currently unemployed but I got a little defensive about it. She got mad and started saying that it's a man's job to be able to support her SO in a situation like that. 

My girlfriend is a strong independent woman and she is always been able to support herself, but I feel this sounds like a red flag. She got so mad and said that is clear that I would never be willing to do something like that so that she could be happy. I said that it is impossible for me to promise something I don't know I will be able to do since like I said I don't even have a job right now. She started saying she is not asking for anything and that she is always been able to support herself and that she is been able to travel a lot without the help of anyone else. She also mentioned that is a man's job to make sure his wife is happy, I then asked what's a girl's job she said is to have babies.

t3_chf55k,Trouble showing emotion..,I am 26m and i have a hard time showing emotions not just with my gf but with my family. It gets to the point to where i dont even know if the emotions i show and have are genuine or not. My gf and even my mom has brought this up. My childhood was good no past trauma or anything like that but i just dont know what to do. It causes fights between me and my gf sometimes because she'll be really excited about something and i will to i just dont express it like how normal people do so she thinks i dont care. For example she just recently got a job making 14 an hour and was super excited about it so was i but i just didnt express it how she wanted i guess. So she thought i didnt care or wasnt happy for her which i am. What can i do to be more open with my emotions?,relationship_advice
t3_chhmyr,I (18M) struggle to talk to the girl (17F) I like,"I met a girl online (in December, specifically) who I'm attracted to. She's called me cute several times in the past. I would love to get to know her better, but it's quite difficult to talk to her: my own nerves get to me and she's not great at texting (stops conversations abruptly or doesn't respond for a long time).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just very confused and unsure of what to do :') she's shown that she's into me but it's also difficult to get close to her... we haven't had many conversations. I sometimes worry that she doesn't want to talk to me, but she's very engaging in conversations and it doesn't seem like she's not enjoying talking to me. I want to get to know her better but I'm anxious and overthinking! I just know I feel different talking to her, happy and hopeful (sounds very cheesy)

He has a birthday in two weeks and I’m really struggling with what to get him. I’ve had so so so many ideas that are all cute and sweet and thoughtful but ultimately I’m stuck and could really use some help. 

Do I get him a cologne he doesn’t have but I know for a fact he likes? Or do I take him shopping with a certain “allowance”? Do I give him a recipe card and the ingredients? Do I even dare get him a Visa gift card to use as he pleases? Any other sweet, thoughtful ideas? Thanks in advance!",relationship_advice
t3_chhmmm,I need advice,"So talking boyfriend lately has been like talking to a damn brick wall. When I specifically even try to tell him he’s not listening to me HE STILL DOESN’T FUCKING LISTEN. Then he gets pissed off at me and makes a fight out of me trying to communicate how I feel, he says I’m “moaning and complaining”
And boy, if I didn’t love him, I’d go the fuck off on him and show him what bitching looks like.
But anyway, he just doesn’t seem to actually listen to me, it’s like everything I say goes in his ear and out the damn other. Tonight we had a fight when how it started was me telling him not to start acting pissy or mad at me because my anxiety has been bad and that makes it 10x worse, he gets pissed off and tells me I’m assuming things, from there it’s a fight and he said some pretty damn hurtful things. 
Then when I tell him “oh thanks for the support, I literally specifically said not to act like this because I’m having bad anxiety”  he says “wow you’re gonna talk about support? Don’t text me anymore”
I’m so emotionally frustrated, he’s not listening to me at all, he won’t listen to how I feel, it’s like he cares about everything else except my serious feelings and mental health. How the fuck can I get through to him?
He’s my significant other and I need his support, and he’s just fucking like ignoring all of my issues and belittling them, then when I get tired of his shit and explode he says I’m overdramatic and crazy.
He’s fine anytime else except when I’m trying to seek comfort and him to listen to my feelings, he was never like this till recently, and recently he’s been working, and I’m afraid because he works around a lot of guys that are pretty big assholes and mistreat their spouses and even cheat, what if all this attitude is being rubbed off on him?",relationship_advice
t3_chhmik,Major plot twist in my emotions,"Over the past year, I [23M] have began to develop feelings for a friend of mine[21F]. A few of my other friends have mentioned how different and happier I look when I hang out with  her and I’m pretty sure her friends tell her the same but we always shrugged off the rumors. 

Recently we’ve gotten somewhat closer and usually text late at night 2-3 times a week. Usually in those conversations it’s just us complaining about stuff or expressing feelings etc. During one of the conversations she confessed she’s had a crush on me, a few times over the time we’ve know each other but never said anything. However, I didn’t make a big deal or say how I felt cause I don’t wanna make things awkward. Despite both growing up in different situations and backgrounds(me leaning more conservative and her liberal), we generally get along well and have a solid friendship despite our views. Another main reason that I am yet to speak up is cause one of my friends recently confessed feelings for her about 3 months ago but she didn’t feel the same towards him. Even though I’m not close to him, if I were to possibly end up dating her, I’m pretty sure he would feel betrayal from my part. 

What should I do?",relationship_advice
t3_chagaw,My wife [50/F] cheated on me [54/M] and we decided to stay together,"My wife [50/F] and I [54/M] have been married for 11 years and together for 13. We met at work over 15 years ago when we were both married to other people. She has two kids, I don't have any. After working closely with her, I fell secretly in love, but did not stray from my original marriage. Then we were on a business trip trip together and she confessed she was attracted to me. I knew right away that my 1st marriage was over. Even if we didn't get together, I knew my 1st wife could never live up to the fantasy of my new love. So, after a few months of what could best be described as an emotional affair, we mutually agreed to leave our partners and live happily ever after.
Fast forward 13 years, and I discovered my wife repeated the pattern and had an affair with her co-worker. She had been having the affair for four months before I found out. I felt betrayed, humiliated, angry, worthless, and alone. I felt like she was stealing my entire family from me, since I would have no rights to see her two kids that I have helped raise for 13 years. I kicked her out of the house, and after a week on her own, she wanted to come back. That was three weeks ago. She moved back in, and we're trying to make it work. 
Do we have any hope? Not only do we have to get past the pain and betrayal that she caused, we have to repair what was broken in the first place. I still love her, but I hate what she did. I continue to get waves of deep emotional pain and even physical nausea. Has anybody been through this and were able to salvage their marriage? I'm hoping to use this experience as a catalyst to really focus on our relationship and grow closer together. Any advice, or stories of success or failure would be greatly appreciated.

t3_chhlfi,I (17M) have a crush on my coworker (17F) and I don’t know what to do.,I started working at a spot near my house and I eventually met a girl there and we clicked. We have only been talking consistently for a little over a month now and we’ve been hanging out with each other outside of work once or twice a week as it’s really easy due to us living on the same street. We also see each other almost every day where we work. After a lot of thinking to myself I’m pretty confident that what I feel towards her is genuine and not infatuation. I want to find a way to tell her how I feel but I’m struggling with finding an appropriate time and place to do so as well as a way to word it. I’m also really scared that things will be awkward if she doesn’t feel the same way as I really enjoy the friendship we have with each-other. What should I do?,relationship_advice
t3_chf2wg,Why do I feel so utterly worthless since her,"I don’t know why. I really liked her and I try to see the best in everyone. I gave her so many passes on awful behaviour. But even I now think that the only redeeming qualities she has is that she’s extremely confident, beautiful and intelligent. Other than that she’s an awful person. She was horrible to me. She used me for emotional support and sex. She even ghosted me for months at one point. She refused to accept she did anything wrong and claimed that everything was my fault. Called me obsessed, immature and told me that was exactly why she didn’t want to take it any further than just sex and dates with me. Everyone I know says the nasty things she said to me are completely false and I know she’s being extremely harsh. I’m 90% sure she was a narcissist. 

So why do I feel so low? I feel like she’s better than me. I feel like I’m a piece of shit who didn’t deserve her and of course she left, I wasn’t worth her time. I feel below her. 

Why is my self esteem so low after this. I’m really struggling to motivate my self to do anything anymore. What’s the point if she’s just proved to me I’m not good enough for her.

We also dated for 6 weeks in grade 10 but I decided back then that we were better off as friends. We have been hanging out more lately and I think I want to start something back up.

I've grown a lot since high school and now we have a lot of the same priorities and goals and he's just all-around a great guy (plus he got a lot more attractive). I want to dip my toe in to see if he would be interested in that too but I don't want to make it awkward or lose my friendship with him. 

Plus I'm worried I'm not his type anymore since he tends to date younger, thinner girls and I'm more of a Marilyn than an Audrey. How do I let him know that I'm interested without screwing everything up? Alternatively, how do I let him know I would be DTF if he doesn't want a relationship?

The day at the fair went great, we separated from the group pretty much from the start and when the rest of the group decided to leave we stayed for another few hours and got dinner afterwards that she offered to pay for since I payed our way into the fair, an I accepted ( it kind of turned into a date which is why I have the question mark after first.

I am going to offer to pay for it all, but I’m sure she will want to pay for either the dinner or the movie, should I accept?

t3_cgxu2v,GF (F 30s) of three years has stopped doing any body hair removal and I (M 30s) am having a hard time with my reaction to it.,"Right away I want to acknowledge that the female body hair stigma is totally sexist and an absurd double standard. This is not about controlling “Amy’s” body or trying to shame her for being a human. Amy and I have been together for just over 3 years and have lived together for about 18 months. We have a great relationship and sex life, with the ups and downs that come with a relationship of that length. I really love her and try to show her both verbally and physically that I think she’s totally gorgeous and super fucking sexy.

Last fall/winter she was dealing with chronic migraines and at the same time was diagnosed with a clinical mental health issue. This was very hard on her and I did my best to be supportive and take household tasks off her plate; she frequently tells me how much she appreciated my help during that time.

As she began new meds and our lives got back to normal she told me one morning that she was planning to take a break from body hair removal because shaving has always made her break out and the other methods were very uncomfortable and/or expensive. I wasn’t exactly excited but I told her that it’s her body and I’ll think she’s beautiful no matter what.

Now a few months later she has basically told me that it’s all here to stay for the foreseeable future. For the past two months or so I’ve really tried to fight it and retrain my thinking but its becoming pretty hard. I miss caressing her legs in my lap and not having to have an inner dialogue about sexism and double standards in my head, it bums me out when I look down I notice the prominent toe hairs instead of her cute pedicure, I miss licking a smooth vulva. I don’t give a fuck if she has hairy armpits.

The worst part by far is how I’ve started to look at other women. I’ll notice a woman’s smooth looking legs and think to myself “I wish Amy’s legs were like that”. It **kills** me. I feel so guilty for thinking anything about her body other than how beautiful she is, because it’s true. Trying to quiet these thoughts quickly proves the old adage that trying not to think about something is the best way to think about that thing (quick, try NOT to think about elephants). I wish I could just flip a switch and not care.

I’ve tried to bring this up a few times, through the lens of “I know it’s because of the patriarchy and absurd beauty standards but this is how I feel”. Her response has never been very receptive. Basically her stance is that “since it’s a double standard and you (me) don’t have to shave your legs why should I care?” or “Well we still have good sex so I don’t feel like I need to” or “You’re being misogynist and you need to think about how you treat me as a person”. I’m the first to admit I can work on these things but there is a small part of me that thinks I shouldn’t have to apologize for what I’m attracted to.

So /r/relationship_advice, any advice for things I could do myself and/or talk to her about?

TLDR - My gf has gone fully au natural with her body hair. Despite my efforts it is proving hard for me to adjust to. I feel really bad for wishing her body was different.",relationship_advice

t3_chd6ft,Is it manipulative to “forgive” then take it back?,"My ex and I had some really awful times. In my view there was a lot of good, of course, but the bad times really hurt a lot. We were stuck in a repeated pattern of conflict followed by resolution. We would fight, apologize, embrace, and ultimately forgive each other. Her forgiveness felt genuine to me and helped me heal after each fight. But then, when we fought next, she would bring things up—no matter how small—that happened years ago to bolster her positions. To the point where I’ve apologized countless times for the same mistakes. 

Now, I don’t do that. I don’t bring up old things that I’ve forgiven. The fact that she doesn’t seem to let anything go has left me really distraught. It’s like your whole world shifts back and forth between one narrative and another, and it’s exhausting and confusing and so painful. 

It makes each moment of forgiveness feel manipulative in retrospect. But she always claims that she meant it at the time, even when she rescinds her forgiveness in the future. 

Am I being unreasonable? Is it normal to bring up the same things all the time? How do you reach a point where that understanding and forgiveness sticks so that you can finally move forward instead of having to endlessly apologize for something you regret and know you shouldn’t have done? Is that possible?",relationship_advice
t3_ch9lvg,Am I wrong here? We have a different perception of time,"So I (m27) work a night shift/closing job as my regular 9-5 and Uber drive around that, before and after depending on energy level. I have a pretty regular rhythm of getting up around 9am if I early drive, 1pm if I don’t; work from 230 to 11pm then I’m off to bed either 4 or 7am. One of my friends birthday came around and while posting on social, turns out they and a group of friends had gotten together and hung out and we’re still out at 3am. They asked me to come out and chill for a sec and this particular day I had already planned on driving extra early, heading to a waiting lot for 5am to sleep there until the 9am rush. Figured this was a perfect start to the day, sent my gf (f31) a text message saying what I was doing, where I was going and to call when she woke up (living with her parents, separate rooms...well, I’m on the couch, they don’t play that lol) . She woke up, called me, and was livid. Asked if I thought it was ok to hen basically threatened that I better understand if she does the same. I told her threats aren’t necessary just express that you don’t like it and we can communicate through this. I asked if there were any type of boundaries she would like to set she says no. Ask if anything would make her more comfortable if it happened again and she said no. Also, not the first time and her comment has always been that it’s weird the time we hang out. I’m friends with a musician and a bar tender. That’s just our rhythm. She’s been fine sometimes  and def never this mad. She’s sent me out at 2am for food several times. What’s so different here? Am I in the wrong? And I how do I explain that I’m game for any boundaries she’d like to set but as she previously has only communicated it as a nuisance (like thinking it’s dumb I watch action movies or anime sort of tone here) why would I have assumed it would be a problem?

t3_cha899,I (F27) am worried my house mate (M26) is going to commit suicide.,"Never really posted before but kind of at a loss of what to do in this situation.

We are based in London, UK.

We’re good friends but have never really gotten onto that level of deep conversation but do get on well with each other and tend to go to the pub once a month or so. My house mate stays locked away in his room all day and night and only rarely appears to use the bathroom - doesn’t even seem to be eating or drinking water. I think he is engaging in destructive behaviour such as drinking and taking drugs. He also doesn’t seem to be going into work / “working from home.” Mainly this part I have heard from his friends as I am out most the day at work and haven’t seen this personally. I’ve also heard from his friends that he has been saying to his girlfriend that he doesn’t want to be around anymore, but she doesn’t seem to want to speak to me at all or fill me in on what’s going on. She comes over maybe twice a week and just sits in the room with him and doesn’t come out herself and never speaks to me. 

Any attempts to go into his room and talk are met with an uncomfortable atmosphere and mostly an unwelcome silence from his bed. I’ve tried going into his room and talking to him but he won’t engage in any form of conversation. He will leave his room to enter the rest of the house only when I am in my room to go to bed, and I can hear him leave at weird hours of the night. 

This isn’t a conversation I’ve ever had with him before, and although his friends and I know something is wrong - both through his behaviour and his closest friends - I don’t know how to act as a house mate when we aren’t overly close. 

I’m really worried for him and not really sure what the next appropriate step would be to take in ensuring he’s not a risk to himself. So any ideas and advice would be welcomed.",relationship_advice

t3_chhcp0,Is it worth waiting for someone you care about.32m and 30f,"I met this great girl about 2 months ago and was really into her. She just recently got out of a very long relationship and basically broke it off with me yesterday. I really liked her and saw long term potential which is why I’m here.

She basically wanted to end it because I was being to demanding and she wasn’t ready for something serious and realized she needed time to heal from her ex and wasn’t in a place where she could let someone serious in. I was sad of course but figured there was no point in trying to change her mind. 

The next day we messaged pretty deeply about her problems and she said she did really like me  but felt guilty because she was going to keep me from someone else and that I was a great guy etc. I don’t believe she is blowing smoke to let me down easy but you can never really know. 

She has been very closed off emotionally and pushing me away the last week or so but up until she called it off I didn’t really know why. After the conversations I ended up saying that I knew she needed distance and I was pushing her to hard to commit and that if I knew ahead of time why she was pushing me away I wouldn’t have tried so hard to push back. Anyway she agreed that she wanted to try to keep in contact and would be more open if she needed space or I was asking for more than she could emotionally give. My question is if there is any hope, should I even try at this point? I do care about her and understand the spot she is in. She told me she tends to bottle things up and not talk about them which in my opinion is why she actually wanted to call it off.

Can I make her not feel guilty about taking up my time when I could go out and Pursue other people that are more ready. 

What do you think would be best? Go no contact and see if she comes back when she is ready. Or should I linger around and check in every once in a while to let her know I still think about her. We never were  never exclusive and I already told her not to feel guilty and if I was up to it I would see someone else and go on dates.

I do care about her. Part of me wants to let her go and fix herself and maybe down the road she will come back. 

The other part of me wants to be around as a maybe a romantic interest . Maybe take her out infrequently if she is up for it and casually date. 

We started out casual and I think things started to go wrong when it got a little more serious. Which was my fault because I wanted something a little more and she wasn’t very open with her feelings and when she starting pushing away I got worried and tried to hard to pull her back in.

t3_ch3q6s,My husband just informed me his life doesn’t “suck” anymore...,"I’m pretty sure it doesn’t as I’ve been keeping him up for the past 4 years...My 49 year old husband told me about a month ago that since being with me he can actually say for the first time ever “his life doesn’t suck.”  

Unfortunately for me, my life has taken a nose dive.  

I am absolutely miserable.  And at 49 years old, I’m not real sure how to tell my family and friends I am a freaking loser who can’t spot a tick even after it bites.  

We met 6 or 7 years ago through an ex boyfriend.   I really liked him when I first met him. I thought “Wow!  Wish I’d met you first. “ But anyhoo, no real communication. He would come around occasionally.  Bring his boat, we’d go to the lake. He was always fun for a day. Then he was gone.  Always with a group.  

Until one night, I was on my back patio having another drink listening to music.  Chilling.  Everyone else was asleep inside.  He came out and professed he thought he was falling in love with me...I was like “what took you so long!”

From that moment on we were inseparable.  It was amazing, wonderful, fun, even the most mundane chores were amazing.  

BAM:  He smokes weed daily...All day.  I’m a RN.  I work daily...All day. He had a job when we met. He had a job when we got together 4 years ago. Since we got together, he has a “job” in name only.  He lost his paying job after we got together.  He got another great job (6 mos) then lost it 2 weeks before we got married (2 years ago).  He has had no “paying” job since then.  It has been 100% commission and when that first one never panned out, he took another 100% commission job.  So he can “work from home” because he can’t stand going into the office 9-5. 

He has had no real pay check for the past 2 years.  An occasional advance.  He talked me into trading my old  Range Rover my parents had given me for a new truck for him.  And he traded it for way less than it was worth, for a truck he can’t afford to pay.  He gave his old Explorer to his brother.  I refused to co-sign for him and refuse to pay the note, so he is consistently 30 days late on the note.  I do pay his car insurance and his boat insurance.  I pay for all food and gas and entertainment and whatever in the heck else I feel like doing because it’s the only way I get to do anything. 

I have FINALLY stopped guiltily paying for his “recreational” activities.  He said, “I clean the house. Am I not worth $100/wk?”  NOPE!!  I work out of town and the only mess you are cleaning is your own!!!

Tonight I found out he gave his “ex” weed dealer a bottle of homemade wine his stepfather had given to me.  How did I find out?  When SHE sent him a pic of her holding a glass of wine and thanking him for it.  He shared the pic with me. ?!?!?! OMG?!?!?!  He’s spent a lot of time over there in the past with her and her mother, even helped her to pack and move.  She now lives 5 hours away.  He says he not interested in her. She “looks like a dyke.”

My family is pretty well to do.  I’m not.  I work hard,  long hours for my money.  We travel as a family.  We have really nice vacations.  I love having a great “plus one.”  I love him, everyone does!!  But I’m about damn done.  THAT is my dilemma.  I’m done being the only one who contributes.  

Sex?  He gets off. I get a vibrator and a cold, rubber penis. 

I’ve told him get a job and pay for your extracurricular activities and pay your damn car note.  That’s all.  I don’t need this stress...And every day he finds an excuse to not do it...And I keep having to pay for everything...I am just done.  

I don’t want to “lose my marriage” but at this point?  I feel totally used.  And what am I actually losing besides face...",relationship_advice
t3_ches1u,Have you ever been or been asked to be in a polyamorous relationship? How did you feel and what was it like?,"So this person I have been seeing, which has been the most amazing thing I have had in my life so far. We connect on all levels and it's so easy. Not to mention we really understand eachother and it's just a great deep connection. However we entered this relationship being open to open relationships and eventually engaging as time passes. Which I am down with and like emotionally fine with. Just recently I have been told by this someone that they would like to try polyamory with myself and someone else. I haven't met them yet, however I feel threatened and kind of hurt in a way. I'm not sure what to feel. If I'm being sensitive or am I being rational. I want to try this but part of me is wanting to detach. Maybe I'm not ready for this. I honestly dont know.

t3_cherzo,How to prepare for inpending breakup ?," Hey guys. I date with my gf for 2 years. Year ago, she dumped me. It was done suddenly and shocked me to the bones. It was my first relationship, and thus the first breakup. 

She came back in one month, after dating some guy for a few weeks. I was stupid enough to let her in my in life again. But I really loved her.

Now, I think it's getting colder. I came on vacation in my hometown, while left her in my apartment where we live together. I pay all the bills, and now she is working in a restaurant. We rarely see each other, but it's only for mouth or so. She came here for a weekend, I came to her, so we somewhat in touch. She refused to have sex sometimes, like one year ago. Last time she came to my hometown and stayed with her mother, not coming to me as she promised, claimed she didn't hear our (my mother and mine ) phone calls. It was the first red flag for me. 

But I think soon she would break up with me like exactly a year ago. Should I try to distance already? Maybe if I distance, I will be more prepared and not crushed when it happens. Maybe even initial the breakup by myself? 

She is not calling and texting anymore, so I know something is wrong. While I'm away from her, should I try to not contact her first? It does feel suck when I text and she answers me with the plain answer, or just read it. I don't want to talk to her. Sometimes I feel that I'm used and don't trust her anymore.

But I still love her, and she claims she does too.

t3_chd13r,I love my friend," 

Hi guys just to let you know this post is gonna be long: (FYI: i'm 17 (if that helps))

Ok so about 6 months ago i got in an accident and lost all my memory ( if you're wondering i got everything back now), and when i was seeing for the ""first"" time my friends i really felt that i liked one (i'm gonna call her J).

So i talked to my best best friend about J and he told me that even if we were very good friends, went along very well it wasn't possible for us to date and that she had already rejected me in the past (in 2015) and she felt really akward with me for a long time .

After she rejected me we stopped talking for more than a year and now we are again really really close, more than ever before. We went just this week on vacations together with mutual friends and we were really acting like a couple (being all the time together, teasing around etc...) (but maybe she was just being friendly?).

For the past two years i have tried getting meaningful romantic relationships with other girls but things never worked out and a few months back i thought: ""Well in fact J has everything i would want in a girlfriend"".

J is intelligent, really funny (she knows her memes),open minded, beautiful, and i could continue for a whole paragraph but you get the general idea, i feel really good with her and i love her deeply.

I know J thinks i'm attractive, intelligent and funny, so i suppose you're thinking : ""Well if you know she likes you why don't you ask her to date ?""

Well for two things:

\-The first is that i would never want to lose her if she gets akward after possibly rejecting me because i love her.

\-Second is that J has never dated anybody (she's 17 too) and I have talked with one of our mutual friends (which i have known for 13 years) and she said when asked about us dating : ""Well i've never seen J being interested in someone and to be honest i don't even see her dating in general""

So first of all thank you for reading through all of this and

What should I do ?

t3_chhbaf,"Dating a girl, whom has baggage. Wwyd?","Quick notes:

I am a 22 average looking male. I'm a software engineer. I make good money. I have my own place, car, motorcycle. I'm overweight. 5'10 and 190lbs. Mild acne. Lightly spoken and I often have problems stepping up for myself and speaking my mind, even though I have good self esteem. Communication with me is.. Odd.  I just speak like an autist and stutter sometimes. I swear a bit much. I am a virgin. I have always focused on career before women. 

This girl.. She's 27 and.. Experienced a hard fucking life. She's been sexually abused by partners. She's been an addict of really hard drugs. I believe sincerely she's clean. She has had 20 surgeries already. She's been prostituted out. She is a bit of a tomboy which is a turn off. She is average looking, I'm really not that attracted to her. She approached /me/ and gave me her num. She's frankly put, far less educated than myself. She makes very little money compared to her DTI and I guarantee she lives check to check. Uber driver. She also sadly has bone cancer, diag. two years ago. 

She really likes me, like constant texting and sending pics to me. I'm fucking torn, because I only like her.. She genuinely wants to spend time with me and I'm curious what outside eyes would think of what I've written.

Please consider my words the truth, I'm not buffing myself up I have flaws as much as anyone but I really am a clean slate. 

Been dating her for a week but this shit is moving fast. Guarantee she wants sex this Friday. I'm a virgin which she knows. Am I making a mistake? Am I a bitch if I leave after sex to a girl in this.. Vulnerable position? Thank you I'm an experienced dude in need of advice and input.

t3_chd0ce,Girlfriend (22F) asked me (26M) to pay her rent and had an issue when I said no.,"Hi, just want to basically confirm that I am not a dick.

Girlfriend of 2+ years. Honestly I have been detached for a while due to long hours at work plus studying for a professional exam. We were talking yesterday about how she has been feeling due to this so I gave suggestions for how I can make more of an effort, as well as told her to say a few stuff that she would like me to do going forward which I was basically committing to giving a good shot at doing. (My expectation was more dates, calling more, spending more time together..romance items.)

&amp;#x200B;

1 of the items she wanted was for me to pay 1/2 her rent.  We do not live together. I do not remember the context of the conversation, but in the past she said something about me taking care of her and I told her the financial aspect of taking care of her is not my responsibility. I do admit to having paid for things and brought her stuff that, looking back, I probably should not have purchased.

I broke up with her last night and just checking this girl has indeed been siphoning off cash off me.

t3_chha6l,19y/o in need of advice on my self image issues getting in the way of relationships.,"Whenever I talk to a guy all that goes through my head is do they actually like me or are they just using me. I constantly doubt that they have genuine feelings towards me and think they they’re just talking to me as a joke or they constantly look at other girls and try to get with them. I don’t know why I always doubt everything, it’s to the point where I unconsciously screw things up by focusing too much on flaws or overly make big deals about small stuff until the guy loses interest. I’ve only ever been in two relationships and am currently talking to a guy I really like, this being because I feel bad for talking to guys since I think they can do better. I feel like their friends make fun of them for giving me the time of day or just liking me ingeneral. 
I really like this guy I’m talking to but the said thing is we’re both just in tech school (me in the airforce and him in the marines) so it won’t last for long. I already can see I’m exhibiting the same behavior I have in past experiences though but I don’t know how to stop. I don’t understand why I do these things. People have told me countless times that i’m not unattractive, most even say I’m very attractive (not saying that to toot my own horn because obviously I don’t feel this way and just see it as them lying and just trying to make me feel better). I just don’t want to ruin this nice thing I have going on with this guy but I also don’t want to get my hopes up. 
With my first boyfriend he ended up dumping me because of this and also mental heath issues, I believe. My second one was also in tech school but he cheated on me and was just a playboy in general. What I’ve been told is that he really seemed to like me in the beginning but lost interest, I assume it’s partially due to my behaviors and a playboy. 
I’ve just been dealing with this issue for awhile and need advice on why I’m like this. The guy I’m talking to now seems to like me a lot based on what my friends tell me and I can see it too until I get into my own head. I’ve almost ended it two times due to this problem as well and I really don’t want to and I don’t want him to be fed up with it to the point where he deems me not worth it anymore, which has happened in the past. 
Side note: it’s not even just with romantic relationships, I have a lot of self loathing. To the point where I just feel like I constantly annoy people and am just unliked in general. Like I am incapable to do things on my own. 
I know I won’t get it but I feel the need to say that I’m not looking for sympathy, I just need to understand why I’m like this and what I can do to try and fix this problem.

t3_chcxtp,My uncle [59] is trying to take my eighty something year old grandmother who cannot walk out of her nursing home,"So, my grandmother a few months back was rushed to the emergency room because she had a very bad UTI which caused a fever. Come to find out that she also has pneumonia. She was in the hospital for up to a month. 

Now, she can’t walk. My grandma was fine before, she lived alone and she was able to walk and take care of herself. We were told that the bedrest and heavy medications she was given might have made her very weak. She says when she tries to stand and take steps, she feels very dizzy and cannot support herself. She can sit up though.

Anyway, my grandma has government aid in California (medicaid?) and she was moved from the ER hospital to a nursing home for older people with health conditions. She has been there for at least a month and a half now.

She still cannot walk. Yesterday, my dad got a call from his sister (my aunt) telling him that his brother (my uncle) decided that the care home was maybe making my grandma depressed and that maybe taking her back to her house will be a change of scenery to encourage her to walk again.

My uncle has absolutely no medical experience. My dad has expressed to his other sisters and brother that this is a horrible idea. They are refusing to listen to us and are going ahead with this.

I’m  posting because I’m wondering if they are allowed to just withdraw her from care like that and it is also causing me stress because I’ve visited my grandmother and she is not in good health at all to be back at her house, even with one of my aunts or uncle living with and watching her 24/7.",relationship_advice
t3_chh81e,Welp.. I think it might be over. [Crosspost from r/divorce],"This is my first throwaway...

My wife and I have been married for 14 years this August. We married young and we're both products have different types of physical and emotional abuse. Systemically I think that this was the mechanism for our destruction.

We both I have worked hard to improve ourselves but over time it seems as though our attraction to each other has dimmed quite a bit. As well as our interests. Not to mention an errosion of trust. 

Earlier in the relationship there were multiple instances where I was involved in emotional affairs. Although there was no sexual contact with anybody I violated the trust in our marriage and completely destroyed my wife's ability to believe my word.

Once I eroded the trust between us it seemed like any time there was any sort of argument no matter how small turned into an explosion. All forms of clear communication became sort of a sick game of blame, manipulation, resentment and denial. 

This cycle has been running for nearly 8 or so years and although we've had many happy times, each time things get rough they become more unhealthy and more toxic.

Throughout all of this I have never once felt as though I needed to give up. I have gone to therapy to treat some of my underlying mental health factors that could easily be contributing to an unhealthy relationship. Until recently we had several larger arguments. One of these arguments I remember a moment where it felt like a switch just flipped in my head. I felt immediately like there was no turning this around and I might as well give up.

There's another factor in all of this. We are child-free not originally by choice but seem to kind of settle into that. For the past for five years we have been discussing being childfree for good and she has been pressuring me towards getting a vasectomy. I am two years short of turning 40. I'm not necessarily excited about the idea of rearing a child at this point but it was always in the back of my mind that she might leave me or we might split up. I really don't want to sterilize myself for good if I'm not sure in the future that I don't want to procreate. I think maybe perhaps that's more selfish in our relationship if she's already decided that she doesn't want to have kids but maybe somewhere inside of me I might still want something like that. I guess I just don't want to not have the option in the future perhaps.

Over the course of the last week I had been confiding in several friends who had recent breakups and divorces some of which were female. This immediately complicated things as some of these communications sort of dance on the edge of emotional infidelity again. 

In the process of negotiating what's next with my wife we started to sway towards trying to work things out again. Things started to look up last night and we had even developed sort of a plan to try and piece things together for one last chance.

This morning my wife sent me an article on emotional infidelity and then began to ask a few questions about who I had been talking to about our issues. I was forthcoming about this information however got nervous when she started talking about wanting to read the messages. One of the messages never really got dicey but I did discuss if my world collapsed that perhaps we would hang out together. Immediately I panicked and deleted that message chain concerned that perhaps my wife would be in there reading them and she would perceive that as an invitation for an affair. That was my biggest mistake. She asked if she could read the messages and then I explained to her that I had deleted some of them. I believe that that completely sealed it for her. Immediately not only was I hiding things from her but I really violated the last little shred of trust that we even had here. I had some hope up until I made that mistake. 

To complicate things in several weeks we are to be traveling to Italy for 2 weeks. This has been an important family trip for her and we've been planning it for years. I most certainly don't want the cancellation of our vacation is the last thing to happen in our relationship. 

During the course of this week we had kind of run through the scenarios of what we will do if we do split up and she has expressed some concern about not being able to pay bills without me. She owns a very small business but does not have the capability of making enough money to support herself. Although at first when she mentioned alimony I had some aversion to it once I looked into it it makes some sense. we had already agreed that whatever her half portion of equity was in the house whether I sold it or came up with the cash would be given to her.

I make okay money for the area that I live in but not a fortune. She has worked to better my life for the time that we've been together. I have no idea what type of payment would be reasonable as far as alimony or even how long it would last. I would assume that it would take her some time to get her feet on the ground and I most certainly would never let her struggle on her own for no good reason. I am concerned however that if I'm paying her alimony it would hurt me financially. I guess I really don't know what's fair. We were really hoping not to get the courts involved and possibly even DIY the filing. 

This is a bit of a plea. I'm pretty sure that it's over. I just don't know what the fuck I can do next to make this is healthy and painless as possible for both of us.",relationship_advice

At the beginning of our relationship it was sorta hard to get us off of each other in the bed room, having sex or some kind of sexual contact upwards of 3 times or more a week. Now she has just “not been in the mood” for a while (about 2ish weeks) and we had to move out and be apart for around a month, she told me she felt a little horny a couple nights ago (but her aunt is in town if you know what I mean and that usually has an impact). She doesn’t like to talk about it with me and if she isn’t feeling it she doesn’t like to talk about anything sexual at all. I mean I am missing being close to her in that way and she knows but I’m just I guess worried because our sex drives are just not connecting. Where as I have the higher one, and she hasn’t really had much of one at all lately. 

Should I be concerned? And if so how should I talk about this with her in a way where I won’t sound like a “horn dog” because honestly, I don’t just miss the sexual pleasure but the close intimacy that comes with it as well. 
She has FaceTimed me every night sense I left a handful of times she fell asleep while on it and I was working on some reports on my computer.

t3_chejt9,I (24M) need advice/coaching on my breakup strategy with my girlfriend (21F),"This is going to be a somewhat long post because I'm not great at expressing my feelings (this is going to be a common theme), but the purpose of this post is to get all of my feelings out on paper so that I can fully evaluate them, but also to get input from you guys to ensure I'm going about this the best way possible.

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for about 5-6 months now and I'm not content with the relationship. She's a wonderful girl.. She's very beautiful, she treats me like gold, and we have a great sex life, but I'm just not sure that our personalities click. Some of the main issues I see are that she doesn't really have any hobbies, and this is something I'm starting to realize is really important in a partner. I workout, play table tennis , softball, video games, listen to podcasts, and  play tabletops with my friends but if I had a gun to my head I couldn't really tell you anything unique that she does for fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, she doesn't seem to have any interest in sharing in my hobbies (totally fine), but what's not fine for me is how she is around my friends. She's just super quiet, and doesn't really joke around all that much, which is kind of problematic because I'm a clown and so are my friends. I don't fault her for this because it's just who she is as a person, but this is something that's important to me.

The biggest problem we've had though is that I just don't think she gets /appreciates my sense of humor, and I can't really ever imagine myself having an ab-hurting laugh with her. Whenever I say something funny, she always simply says ""you're so silly babe"" and it drives me nuts. I want someone who will engage with me, bounce ideas off me, and someone who I can create inside jokes with. Whenever she delivers that line it just sort of cuts the conversation short and leaves a lot to be desired .

&amp;#x200B;

So... my main concern here is that I genuinely feel that if I were to break up with her at this very moment, she would be blindsided and  very hurt. I think she's falling love with me and sees the relationship as perfect. I'll be the first to admit that this is 100% my fault because, while I've had these concerns, I did not address them timely (if at all) and my poor communication skills definitely contributed to the downfall of the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's where the strategy comes in, and I genuinely don't know if this is even more of a dick move or if it could actually help ease things.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I saw an opportunity to make it ""less of a blindside"" in a sense, so that I don't just surprise her with a breakup. We were texting about open communication and she asked me if there's anything I wanted to discuss with her so I took the opportunity to mention the ""you're so silly babe"" thing. I feel like I addressed it with grace, but she actually got super pissed at me because she wasn't expecting a gripe (admittedly the timing was a bit off because just a few minutes prior we were talking about a sensitive issue, but I kinda felt like she led me into a trap lol).  So we had a mini-fight and decided to table the discussion for now,  but now I genuinely kind of feel that if I were to break up with her, she wouldn't be so surprised (wow, it's almost as if communicating in relationships makes things easier). So my question is... was this a dumb thing to do? Am I hurting her even more by just not doing it now? I know I fucked up a lot during the course of this relationship, but I do really care for and respect this girl. I want to make this as easy as possible for her and I don't want her to miss me. Please give me your thoughts

I(22F)went to my boyfriends(26M) parents house for Easter and spent time with him and his parents. His mom is much thinner than I am and the whole weekend I was comparing myself to his mom and his aunts. 

I know his mom diets and does try to actively keep a nice figure. I have gained weight recently and am very self conscience about my weight. 

On Easter morning his mom made us all cute little Easter baskets. In my boyfriends basket and his siblings basket where normal treats and chocolate. 

In my basket there was diet treats.. like from the Atkins program I think she had left over? 

I never said anything to my boyfriend but my feelings are hurt by it. I’ve never had an issue with his mom but if that’s how she thinks about it me it makes me never want to go back to their house. 

Should I tell my boyfriend? I don’t know how to work through this. It’s an uncomfortable situation.",relationship_advice
t3_chcruh,Would you give a second chance to a cheating ex partner?,"Hi everyone,

Last month an ex girlfriend who cheated on me 3 years ago got in touch with me for some random reason. We talked a little casually but then it became rather serious from her side. She told me she still had feelings for me, she was still feeling guilty and that she wanted to try to make me happy if she could. 

You see, this gets me very conflicted, I couldn't give a straight no because I don't know what to think. 

3 years ago this meant the world falling apart for me, but now with a new perspective, I could see why things happened, I could never justify what she did, but now maybe I don't quite see it as terrible. She kissed a friend of her best friend and told me 2 days later about it. I remember that I noticed she was conflicted even before I asked her about it. I don't know.

What do you advice me to do? 

Is it bad to even try?

t3_chambq,Is it fair to ask dates to meet me in the middle for the first date?,"I’ve just recently started to get into online dating, and I want to ask some advice on an issue related to first dates. I live in a small city that is about 30 minute drive from a large city, on a good day with no traffic. Although my city is small, there are trendy breweries, and coffee shops that although not as numerous as in the bigger city, are still worthwhile to visit. Additionally, there are other small cities in between my city and the big city which also have plenty of adequate places to meet for a first date.  My problem is that 90% of the people I go on first dates with just want me to go to their big city for the first date, usually somewhere they can just walk or drive 2 minutes to, while I’m stuck driving 30-60 minutes to get there. Is it unreasonable to ask them to meet me somewhere in the middle, so we both have to drive a roughly equal distance? I’m just getting tired of people not even offering to meet me halfway when I’m also busy and working full time like most of us, so it’s not like I have loads of free time. Or am I being unreasonable given that the big city has more (and probably “cooler”) options in terms of places to meet up?",relationship_advice

t3_chcqpt,My (20f) boyfriend (23m) does not want to give me oral sex,"Hey everyone, 
Sorry If it doesnt belong here, dont really know where else to post it^^

I am really happy in the relationship and the normal sex already is nice, especially because he almost everytime tries to make me cum with things like fingering etc. Unfortunately, he feels disgusted by the thought of giving me oral sex, not because of the smell or anything (I shower daily and do everything to not evolve any ""smell"") but because of the ""wetness""
I dont mind giving him oral sex (tho sometimes he doesnt shower for like 1-2days and then I just couldnt because I am really sensitive to smells) 
And I just dont know what to do. He is really good with his fingers but it's just nothing compared to oral. Everytime I read about oral sex I get jealous and if I bring it up my bf just gets annoyed.

What can I do about the whole situation? Either ways to deal with it or other solutions would be appreciated)",relationship_advice

Last week we planned on spending the day together, going to the zoo and whatnot, but the day before she cancels saying she is behind on stuff she needs to do.

I was raised in my dad's country (muslim) and we later move to my mum's country (europe). My parents divorced a few years back and I am still living in my mum's country, for very obvious reasons. 

My dad has always been hinting that I should go back to his country and settle there. That's what he wants for me. While I feel like I have better opportunities where I am.

I am moving abroad soon, and today he told me that I should forget about him if I bring anyone home that is not from his country. I was shocked by this. I don't even have boyfriend so that was out of the blue. So I told him that I cannot just marry anyone because of their nationality, so he changed it to anyone who is not muslim.

Anyway, one thing that frustrates me is whenever the topic of her family comes up, she gets super defensive. She interprets everything as an insult towards her family, even when that's not my intention.

Today we were discussing our finances and she was going to send some money to her dad. I told her that I have an overdue bill and that I'll get a big penalty if I don't pay it today. I asked if we could pay her dad in 2 days (after I get paid) and pay the bill now. She flat out said no, he needs to be paid today.

I kept pressing the matter and was telling my wife how I'm going to have to pay a huge late payment fee if I don't pay this bill today, and I asked if we could send her dad a portion of the money today and the rest in 2 days. She still said no and didn't want to negotiate at all.

I asked why he needs the money so urgently. I said ""just tell him we'll pay him in 2 days, he's not going to die if we pay him in 2 days instead of today"".

Then she got super mad at me and was saying that one thing she won't tolerate is me insulting her family. And she went on about how her family is the most important thing and she'll divorce me if I ever mention her family again.

I take a screenshot and then go to work. As soon as I come home I load the picture again to find the comment has been deleted, but I still have the screenshot.
I go to her fb to explore the likes on her pics, and find him again with love likes. Here’s when I start to get weird feelings, so I open the guy’s profile and cannot really see much as we’re not friends but I find they’ve been exchanging hearts on their pictures since 2018.

t3_chgzr0,My boyfriend [30M] is wanting more and more time alone and I don’t know if it’s because he is sick of me [27],"Okay so hear me out. We have been together for 8 months, living together for 3. I’ve been not working the last two months and home a lot.

Recently (the last month) we will go for hours without talking. He asks me for time alone. I give it to him, don’t get me wrong. But it’s been more often lately. And I can’t help but feel like he is just sick of me and maybe rethinking being in the relationship. 

He works a lot. And when he is home it’s sleep - gym - relax - work. 12 hour shifts. 

He’s been often in this mood where all he does is sit on reddit or ig. He won’t talk to me. I go to hug or kiss him and he lets me but doesn’t return it. I say “I love you” and he says it back, but lacking enthusiasm.

Our relationship is really good. We have even talked about this bothering me. But he says it has nothing to do with me he just wants alone time. That “we don’t always have to do everything together.”

And I have no issue with this and it’s a human right but the lack of affection when I show it bothers me. I’m a loving person and I like to show it, but I also know I’m by nature needy so it’s hard to gauge when I’m being selfish with it and unreasonable. 

I start work tomorrow. We won’t always have days off together and likely won’t even see each other every day. Or sleep together as he gets home in the morning. 

But I have no one in my life I want to give all this info to that can help me asses things. I’m a bit insecure, and I can’t help but feel like it’s me. Like he is sick of me not just wanting time alone. A part of me thinks that this is how relationships begin to end. And I’m already such an anxious person this puts thoughts into my head that have no business being there. 

I would love some insight from people who maybe went through this.

t3_chcmip,Friends in my group causing issues and making it feel like a one-sided friendship. What to do?,"I am 20F and in my group there is my boyfriend (20M), two other guys, and my friend (20F) and her bf (20M). The issue is with my friend, Emma, and her bf Joe. Most of us live downtown and Emma and Joe live about 20 minutes away in the country side. Whenever we make plans, they never want to come out because they don’t like the club or they don’t want to drive into town because they want to drink or smoke, and Uber costs too much. Countless times one of our group members will have driven them into town and ubered them back. It’s mainly just me, my bf, and our two male friends who go to the club together or just chill and play video games. We try to compromise for Emma and Joe and go to their house to see them, but they refuse to come to us. It is a trek to get there and gas is expensive, but we do it because we care about them. These past few weeks there has been conflict in our group because Emma and Joe will get upset that we don’t want to go camping or go to their house, but will refuse to see us at any point. We always have to work around them and it’s really frustrating, and it’s ruining the friendship between my bf, his friend and Joe. We are upset because we feel like we try to make it work and see them, but they couldn’t care less about us and only want to hang out when and where it suits them. If we can’t make it they get very angry with us and accuse us of not wanting to see them, excluding them etc (despite compromising and inviting them). I get that they don’t like the club, whatever, but we don’t always go. Emma is one of my closest friends, and no one in my group (unknown to her) really likes her because of how she acts. She comes off as not really caring about anyone else’s plans and feelings, and expects us to be at her beck and call and cancel plans to see them when they won’t make an effort to see us. What do I do? My bf, me and our two guys friends have been thinking about either working harder to see them and make more compromises, for to just cut them out because they cause a great deal of stress and tension for our group. If we go with the latter, it would hurt the guys because they’ve been best friends with Joe for years, but ever since Emma came into the group, she’s been extremely controlling and bossy with the group.

t3_cheaz2,My gf has a crisis and I don't know what to do,"My(26) Gf(24) and I are together for over 8 years now. We were a pretty normal couple with ups and downs, nothing too special. In the last years it began to be more downs than ups which is mostly my fault. In general I see myself as a good boyfriend. I do most of the work in our apartment, I'm cooking like 99% of the time and do multiple tasks to help her in her daily life. That is mostly because she is working full time since she's 18 and I am studying since I graduated with 19( we are from Germany). The problem is I was never happy with my studies and am in fact still not finished with it. Most of the time I was sitting at home doing nothing useful. I am not an Overly lazy person in general but tasks I had to do like studying, managing my adult life stuff and so on became more and more hard for me to motivate me for. I was drifting in this hole of zero motivation even for things I Normally loved to do over the years.
So in the last years she was mostly In a bad mood because of all that and because I didn't earn much money we weren't able to do many nice things she was expecting from her early 20's. She is blaming me for ruining her future which I fully understand and I am In no way mad that she thinks that way. I mean I am even more mad about myself for wasting not only my last years but hers too. We had dozens of long fights and talks about it and I wasn't able to change much about myself.
That brings us to the present day. I have a decently payed job since a few months and overall  I was able to change my view on many things. Its still very hard for me to motivate me for many things but I'm working on it and It gets better. I am still not finished with my studies which is an awful topic for me even thinking about it makes me feel very bad and awful. We talked about ending the relationship but we both really love each other still.
She is in a bad state right now and only talks about it from time to time. She doesnt know what is really her problem but I try to sum up a few things which she brings up the most. She does not know how to feel about me and our relationship. Her anger about my mistakes and behavior in the last years is a big problem for her which she is not able to ignore. She can't say if she will. Be able. To forgive me. She doesn't know what she wants in many things right know. Talks about not really feeling much at all. She has some minor problems with her family. Money is still a big problem, but solvable in the next months in my opinion. She doesn't want proximity from my side and from no one really. She feels like she can't talk about all that with anyone. Some time alone is also not an option as she says she hates to be alone with all her thoughts.
I really don't know how to help her. Im trying my best to be a better person and erase the problems coming from my side. I told her we can end the relationship if that's it what she wants. It would break me completely but I only want her to be happy again and if that's it what it takes I am more than willing to do that.
I know I'm an asshole because I am the reason for many things she has trouble with right now.
The Only thing I want to know right now is how I can help her. She is such a great person and does not deserve this at all.
I am open for any advise you guys have.

t3_chgy03,How can I [27F] be more open and vulnerable in dating someone new [28M]?,"I got out of a yearlong relationship about 6 months ago. It was a tough breakup. He was someone I saw  a life with, and he told me he saw his future with me too. I went through all the stages (depression, anger, etc), did all the things you're supposed to do (worked out, reconnected with friends, cut my hair lol) and it was really tough, but finally, I felt like me again! So because I felt ready, I started dating around 3months ago. I went out with a handful of guys, met some nice people, but no one I was really attracted to or interested in. Usually we'd go on 1 or 2 dates, and I would tell them they are great, but the connection wasn't there. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, I FINALLY met someone I felt excited about! We went on a date, I was attracted to him, we had fun. Then he asked me out a second time, and... we had sex. Which was fun! But here is where I totally panicked. This is the first time I have slept with someone since I have been single, probably my first new sexual partner in nearly two years. And sex, which had become something intimate and familiar and full of love, was fun, but was now something different: With a person I liked but was still getting to know. So, perhaps I slept with him too soon into knowing him. I used to sleep with people quickly when I was younger, and felt ok? As soon as he finished, I excuse myself to the bathroom to get a grip. My instinct is now to place emotional distance between me and this person I just slept with, so I put my clothes on, get in bed, and don't cuddle. I ask the time and tell him I probably shouldn't stay much longer because I have to be up early for work in the morning and leave maybe 30 minutes later. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I met my ex, after our second date, I was SMITTEN. I fell hard and fast and felt like I knew him so intimately (I didn't) and without abandon. Now, I feel very reserved. Like I am afraid to care about this guy (who, for all I know, may just want a casual fling). I like him, but he is something new and different from my ex - my ex was more playful, this guy more serious. I shouldn't be comparing and I should just get to know this new person who again, I MAY REALLY LIKE, but how do I do that when my instincts are now to run away from getting too close??

&amp;#x200B;

For context about the breakup: we met shortly after he got out of an 8yr relationship where his partner came out as gay. He was basically an emotional mess. I tried to be patient and told him to work on himself and find me when he figured things out, but he would push me away and pull me in, and I fell for it every time, which I feel like may have made it hard for me to trust.

He had said the same in return. We’ve been going out for three months now. We see each other several times a week; we take each other on dates; we have slept together; and we are overall very comfortable with each other. 

I am not one of those people who likes to leave relationships in the vague zone. I did tell him in the after about of month of dating that I would like to be asked to be official and exclusive when he felt ready. It doesn’t have to be fancy of course but he agreed.

t3_chgxf2,"Paradox between ""The Abundance Mentality"" and ""Being Complete and Whole Alone"" Is there middle ground? [21M]","I'm gettin deep

Quick summary of The Abundance Mentality if you guys didn't know: There is no one special ""soulmate"". There are multiple people in which you can love, connect with, and become close to in your own unique way. It is true that'll you'll never meet someone like that person, but the odds of finding someone better or similar to them are almost certain if you keep your options open and are putting yourself out there.   


This is what prevents the neediness and the ""onenitis"" people often feel with they lose someone. However, I have one issue with the abundance mentality: It's not guaranteed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure there may be hundreds and thousands of people you may connect with and can love, but it doesn't mean you'll find them. There is however, the one thing that most people have that keeps them confident in believing it which is: Faith. Faith that they'll meet someone new that IS better than what they had, in every way. But my question is, why is there such a rush to replace? What exactly are we replacing with this idea?

&amp;#x200B;

We want a replacement, I believe because we miss those feelings of care, love and connection with someone. It's craved and the idea of ""replace, replace, replace"" comforts us because we have the faith that we'll get it back or just get it in general, rather than give these emotions to ourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

The relationship with ourselves is the most important relationship. Before we get into a relationship with someone else, we must already feel complete. Feel whole, with all the love, care and connection we'll ever need. So, with this idea of abundance, the point to replace is almost unnecessary. There's nothing to fill. 

Is there a middle ground to this?",relationship_advice
t3_chbcmk,Should I break up with my emotionally unavailable boyfriend?,"Premise: We are both 23 year old and go to different med schools. 
We have been together for almost four years. It is a long distance relationship. We keep in touch through texts and calls and we meet once a month. We are very serious and plan on marriage someday (Which is mostly me planning the future while he says 'okay')

Emotionally unavailable because: I came into the relationship because he was a different person when he was 'courting' me (not exactly dating because it was a long distance thing). He was emotionally available as in, he made it a point to communicate.

We had genuinely hit it off and it went well for a few years.

Since then, I have, at many times, felt like I was talking to an automated teller response. We have had bitter fights about how he expresses no emotion at all. Small stuff like him not saying he misses me after part, him NEVER initiating a conversation, stuff like him never saying 'I love you' like he means it, etc.

Sometimes I do feel like I am being overly needy and I have at countless times questioned AITA here. I don't even know what is normally expected in a relationship anymore. But since it is a long distance relationship I simply cannot take an 'Okay, nice' for a nude I sent him.

He has always been there for me but he won't tell me about what he is feeling anyday. Whenever he is upset, he will withdraw. I know everyone needs their space but three years of this and I feel ashamed for trying to share my problems with him.

I know he cares about me a lot and he genuinely makes an effort. After countless fights, he makes an effort to say 'I love you' or say 'I miss you' but stuff like that feels like an updated verison of an automated teller response again. I can sense that he does not mean any of it. And he does not want to hurt me.

I love him a lot but I sometimes think this lack of real emotion will drive me crazy. We were planning to move in together after two years but most of me wants to break up with me. A little part of me is scared that he actually loves me.

t3_che8z3,I [26F] feel like I need to leave my husband [31M] but am terrified.,"I posted this on relationships, but it got removed and I was told to try domesticviolence instead, but being as though he's not violent towards me or our daughter I don't believe it belongs on there, so I'm hoping I can get advice on here.

So me and my husband have been married 4 years, and have a 2 year old daughter. We've always had problems but for a long time I thought it was just normal relationship stuff and we easily got past it. I'm starting to feel like fighting every few days isn't something I want to keep dealing with though.

He drinks what I think is a pretty ridiculous amount but he insists is normal.. every couple days he'll usually have an 18 pack plus a couple more of those big cans of beer, and occasionally throws some liquor in the mix. Sometimes he's fine, but more often than not he'll flip out on me all night long over things that I don't even have control over (I don't want to go into detail because I'm worried it'll give me away to people who might know me if they see this, but it's to do with problems between people we know, not anything that we can actually get involved in but he feels like I should be able to fix for them). He'll insult me and my family, yell at me for asking him to slow down drinking because ""I don't have any say until I can afford to pay all the bills"" and if I have a problem with it ""make some damn money and then I can talk"". He'll put me down about every little thing he can think of, call me a bad mother because he wakes up earlier than me, etc.

I'm honestly so tired of having myself and my family insulted and having him belittle me for every little thing he knows I'm already bothered about. I'm tired of seeing him totally wasted on a regular basis and acting like an idiot. I'm tired of him making me feel like I'm the problem and that hes the only one doing anything.

However, I dont know how to support myself, much less a child. I'm also afraid of him getting majority custody of the child since 1) I cant drive, nor do I own a vehicle, 2) I have a history of suicide attempts and involuntary commitment, 3) I have never made much money, I honestly think theres something mentally wrong with me because no matter how hard I try at every job I work at, I just don't catch on to anything and move too slow on top of it, so I've never been able to get many hours and struggle to keep a job. And 4) I have no idea where I would live on my own or what to do about childcare.

Hes made it very clear he has good lawyers that would do anything they can to screw me over and make sure I get nothing (custody, child support, assets) if we were to divorce. Hes threatened to hurt my family and run off with our child before too. I want to leave so badly but I feel so helpless to do anything. I'm so lost and confused.

Tl;dr husband is possibly an alcoholic, drinks a lot and acts like a jerk, insults me and my family and threatens them and to run off with my child if I were to leave.

I feel disappointed with how much we don’t talk. We Snapchat a little bit throughout the day, but we never talk about anything real. And when I do try and start a conversation about something that’s stressing me out over here, he just says “oh geesh.” And doesn’t ask questions to even pretend he cares about what’s currently going on in my day to day. I thought that was just a sign he wasn’t interested anymore, so when I discussed that with him, ready to move on, he got really upset and hurt and was very confused on why I felt we had any issues at all.

In his defense, he doesn’t use his phone much, doesn’t even really use social media. And in person he’s made some really sweet gestures. I feel like he just doesn’t understand what it’s like to be in a mature relationship or what it’s like to be emotionally supportive for your partner. Like it’s not his fault, that’s just how he is being a young man. 

It’s just really hard watching all the other girls on my team when their boyfriends call them daily just to chit chat, and mines never done that once. Again, im deployed half way around the world for 9 months, and phone calls is only connection we have and he shows no interest in that. I don’t wanna sound like a clingy girlfriend asking him to call me, but if I’m going to have a man, I want to be able to share with him. Otherwise I’d rather just be single so I don’t even have to get frustrated about this stuff.  

Please be brutally honest haha, am I expecting too much? And if not, what would be a good way to phrase my words when bringing this up to him? 

So sorry for the long post 🙃",relationship_advice
t3_chgvkn,I [M 28] and my partner [F 28] are having a rough night after a long talk about our relationship and could use some advice.,"So this is gonna be a long one, and probably not properly formatted cause I'm on mobile.

My partner and I have been together 5 years, but for the past year or so we have lost a lot of the intimacy we used to have. We were in a long distance relationship for about 10 months but then ended up moving in together. I now think we rushed and both of our inexperience in love and not knowing how to properly resolve problems led to take our relationship for granted. Tonight we had a talk after a couple of rough weeks and basically came to the conclusion that we both loved each other a lot but she had fallen out of love with me. I'm attributing this to general neglect and me being inconsiderate in some key areas that put us on this path. We're working on it and giving it some time to see if we can rekindle and repair our feelings. 
It both feels like a massive relief that we're addressing this stuff directly but I'm also scared that our relationship is in such jeopardy. I can give more details if people ask but I'd like some general advice if people have been in similar situations. 

We have a strong history and get along really well but things have just gotten...distant. We had a very constructive talk and now she's gone to have a drink with some friends and I'm relaxing at home as well. Thanks in advance for anything you guys give me.",relationship_advice

t3_che628,How tf do I [20M] get through a breakup on good terms.,"Sorry about my thoughts being scattered. I’m a mental wreck right now.

I’ve been in two long term relationships, my most recent ending officially today. We dated for 1 year and almost 8 months (longest and most in depth relationship yet). We ended it on good terms but I’m so upset. I still love her so much and I’ve missed EVERY second without her.

She was living with me. Then she broke up with me. She stayed here for a few more days before officially leaving this morning and I could’ve never felt emptier. 

We broke up because we were kinda heading in different ways but things weren’t set in stone for either of us. She hasn’t been talking to me much today and I just feel so lonely. My parents are here for me but I really just don’t want to talk to anyone but her. I miss her so much. I am hurting so much. I never thought that ending it on good terms could be so mf painful. I was cheated on in a prior relationship and I always thought that would be my worst breakup. It’s starting to make sense that it was easier to get over that because I no longer loved that girl. 

My best friend literally told me that we shouldn’t talk to help her get over the pain. I know it’s just making it worse for me but I feel like it’s for the better. I haven’t been able to stop crying since I got home from work and I had to hold back tears at the office several times. 

I really just want to move on but I can’t because I love her and I miss her so much. Fuck.

Originally,  she wanted to leave today. Then last night she talked about staying the rest of the week to try and work things out. And I’m the one who suggested that she should stick to her initial response and leave. Idk if that’s because I wanted this or what. I just feel like she’s not here anymore because of me and that we could have compromised and met in the middle. Fuckjkjjjjk

t3_chcfdk,Did my gf cheat on me? How much blame do I hold for this?,"Very complicated situation, but I’ll try to explain it best I can. Sorry for the wall of text. So earlier this year, my girlfriend brought up the idea of 3 some with another girl. I was apprehensive at first, but we talked about it a lot and I agreed after she told me she wouldn’t be jealous. I told her this was not something that I needed and she was all I needed, and I that also I wouldn’t ever be comfortable with a 3 some with a guy. She told me that wasn’t interested in other guys at all, but it could be something fun for us to do together (with a girl), so we agreed we would try it out. Also, important note, she is bi, but had only hooked up with one girl before. 

So we made a tinder, and began our search, and she was getting a lot of attention from girls who wanted play with her alone. So about a week into this she asked me if I was alright if she could play with girls alone. I’ve never been in this situation before but I didn’t think much about it and agreed. The first time she hooked up with another girl (I wasn’t there) she sent me pictures and I felt off, and jealous. I played it off as me being childish and insecure, as she’s always been committed to me and very loving. She hooked up with another girl a few months later, this time she asked if I wanted to see anything, and I said no. I think she realized I wasn’t as comfortable with this as I had made it seem when she first asked me. She asked me if it bothered me and I just deflected and said it was fine. I understand I fucked up here and should’ve been honest. 

Anyways, this all came to head around 2 months ago. It was her birthday, so I took her out to a nice place, and threw a surprise party for her. She got really drunk, which she normally doesn’t do, but totally okay, it was her birthday. Into the party I was looking for her and she had disappeared. Earlier I had noticed she had been really flirty with this other girl. Then when I went looking for her, I heard from other people at the party that she was hooking up with the girl she was flirting with earlier in the bathroom. Not gonna lie, it upset me. She was throwing up later that night and I was taking care of her.  when she came around I asked her about it and she told me yes it happened. We discussed it at length the next day, and I told her how this was affecting me. She apologized and said that it was not a good time to do it since we had just had a really special night together. But it was her birthday and she got really fucked up so I understood. She told me she loved me but this was a side of her she wanted to explore while she was young, and that she felt secure and comfortable with me. She said that she could never date a girl, but was only attracted to them sexually, but not emotionally. I agreed and that I could be okay with this if she would just tell me beforehand, to not do this on whim, and if it wasn’t too frequent (like once every 2 months). I was trying work through my insecurity. She agreed and we moved on. 

Fast forward to this week. She went on vacation with her family to an island paradise. She made some friends her age and has been going out with them. She went out to the bar and there she texted me asking me if she could make out with a girl. I said sure, but found this suspicious because she had only been texting me when she had WiFi. Before she left, she told me she probably wouldn’t have WiFi at the bar and she’d let me know when she was back in her room. So now all of sudden she has WiFi, and the first thing she asks me is if she can hookup with this girl. I call her out on it, and she says a girl that works at the bar and gave her the WiFi password. I ask her if she had kissed the girl and then asked me afterwards and she confirmed that was the case. Come the next day after more prying, she admits she let girl do more to her, and she was scared that I’d be mad. I obviously got heated, I was pretty hurt over this. This has truly been the only serious fight we’ve ever had in this relationship, and she also agrees she crossed a line. At this point I’m just really confused. Am I just being too insecure and is this my fault for not being clear about how I felt. She still had kind of a yellow light with regards to this, but I just don’t know. 

Besides this our relationship has been wonderful, we don’t ever fight, she’s thoughtful and loving and I’ve never felt this way about anyone before. 

Any thoughts would be really appreciated. Just really looking for some perspective here",relationship_advice
t3_chb666,Should I tell my bosses about my personal issues??,"Hopefully this is the correct forum to post this. I've been working at a really great small company for almost a year now. Recently, I've been off my game because my father who lives in another county was diagnosed with cancer and had major surgery. Because of my work obligations, money, etc. I was not able to go see my dad after his surgery. It's been really stressful to deal with from far away. I also recently purchased a home and going through renovations which is also taking a toll on my stress.

I have a pretty good relationship with my bosses but I know they've noticed that my work is not what they usually expect. I don't know if I should let them know about my personal problems. I'm worried that they might see it as an excuse or stop assigning me large projects because of it. I want to be able to balance all of my responsibilities but lately it's been hard.

t3_che1zr,"Have you just met your soulmate, and you haven't felt this way ever before, but you do cry very often since you met?","Yeah. Being in a destructive relationship, with someone who makes you feel like you have met the first true love of your life, is not what you think.

I want to share this  because I wished I heard this in my last relationship. Whatever makes the relationship destructive, it always has a thing in common. The thing in common is that it makes you feel sad, shitty, or feel awful at the same time as it makes you feel euphoric as f when it feels good.


Maybe it is just a drug. You feel high all the time around the person, but directly when you don't get the love from him/her it gives you  abstinence, as a drug. Because that is what it is. And maybe you are wandering around thinking that you have fallen in love for the first time in your life, because this is so much stronger that any love you have ever felt before, and it fucks up your whole world in a way that makes you believe in God. 

It isn't a ""greater kind of love"" that you feel towards this person. You are not feeling more love than you ever felt before. It is just more feelings. Several bad emotions. Mixing anxiety, worry, desperation, and ""why am I crying so often even though I am so in love"" -wonderings, with a huge portion of love, will make you think that the love itself is greater than any love you felt before. 

And when you get out of that destructive relationship you think you will never meet someone like that again. And everyone and everything is dull and damp in comparison. So when you fall in love next time, and connect with someone who can offer you a non-destructive  relationship, you will think that you just aren't that in love with this new person. You will question  why you aren't  head over heels as you were with the ex, especially when this new one is the most perfect partner. This is because that ""strong-outofthisworld-love"" you had, was just bad emotions + love emotions = labeled as only love, and confused with a greater kind of love.

t3_che0rt,My family doesn’t bother to to give a crap about my boyfriend.,"My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly two years. We are both graduate students . He is the light and love of my life. So incredibly smart, intellectual, artistic, and charismatic. So why the hell is it so hard for my family to give a shit about him and his life? My family is religious, but I am not and neither is he. When my family gets together they tend to only talk about the “community”, gossip, and talk in a language that only a religious Jew would understand. I grew up in it, but my boyfriend did not. He was raised reform. So a lot of the time he doesn’t understand what they are talking about. Part of me thinks that they aren’t accepting of the fact that he isn’t religious. But then I realize, does that mean they aren’t accepting me? I feel like a fish out of water with my family regardless if my boyfriend is there or not. I always have. They are very conservative and uptight. Where I am fairly liberal and go with the flow. Also, I have a lot of cousins around our age who sit at the table with me and my boyfriend at dinner and get togethers and don’t ask him a single question. At first I thought it was my boyfriend being too quiet or shy, but then I understood that my family is so self involved  they don’t give a shit about anyone but themselves and the attention of the table needs to revolve around them. The worst part is that I opened up to my mom about this who completely agreed with me but told me there’s nothing I can do. And because of that my boyfriend struggles to want to be involved in any of my family gatherings. He always says that “if you want me there I’m happy to be there by your side, but I’m generally uncomfortable around them so it’s hard for me”. It breaks my heart especially because I LOVE his family. They are progressive, laid back, open minded, and very welcoming. They constantly ask me questions and are always wanting to know what I’m up to. I feel like I fit into his family better than my own. It’s just devastating because if we were to get engaged and married someday I want us to be able to feel comfortable around my family, at least to some degree.

t3_cgsv34,I (24m) have some savings my GF (24f) doesn't like. and it gets worse...,"  

Hi all, been lurking on this for a while but first-time needing advice… (also apologies for spelling and grammar as I am dyslexic.)

Me (24m) and my GF (24f) have been together little over a year now, we are about as serious as it can get for a year and with us both still living at home with parents. We both earn roughly the same amount, she probably has the edge a little, but due to a cheaper lifestyle, lower board (rent) and a few other factors I can put more money into my savings each month than she can. This has meant I have built up a nice nest egg over the last year mainly to get me through the last year of college (as I will be unable to work a lot if at all) but also as a start towards a house. My GF found out about this money a few months ago and it has caused friction in the relationship. She is of the opinion that because I have more money that I should pay for the majority of our things (dinner, trips out etc…) when we usually operate a 50/50 split or take turns (which she was perfectly happy with before). I have explained that I have saved this money to pay for my year out of work and that I will need it to run my car and buy food and other general living expenses but it hasn’t changed her mind. Recently she suggested to my mom that I should pay for the 2 of us to go away for a week with my savings. She also said she would like it if I spent it all on a new car as this would make our savings equal.

Here is the other aspect. My grandfather is terminally ill and we have been told he doesn’t have long left. This has been a tough time for all the family but we are doing the best we can. He told me when I went to see him that he has left me some money in his will that is to be used for a house. I cannot express how thankful I was that even with what he is going through my grandfather was still trying to look out for me. Some of you may see the dilemma this puts me in though… my GF is already being funny with me about my finances with the savings I have. And now it looks like I am going to have to hide this money from her so it doesn’t risk doing more damage to the relationship. What do I do? Tell her and see how she reacts? Or hide it but then have to explain how I got all this money when I come to buy a house in the near future?",relationship_advice

t3_chgnrl,Afraid to leave?,"I met and started dating my husband at age 17 he was 21 and we immediately moved out and got an apartment together. Everyone doubted our relationship so I constantly felt like I had something to prove. We got engaged two month into dating. I was definitely not grown up enough to make the decision to spend my entire life with someone but I did. Fighting for each other we really lost alot of relationships. Most importantly, he and his babys mother had a falling out and he never confronted the issue and he lost rights of his daughter. I have always deep down felt like he resented me for this but it was his decision and wrong doing.

He had a much more reckless lifestyle then I have ever had. He convinced me to try and get addicted to drugs and between the two of us we ran through all of our money (over $10,000) on partying. We didn't make enough money for the lifestyle we were living and put ourselves in a bad place. There was even a period of time where we had our power shut off and had to live without power for almost 6 months. We would get numerous months behind on rent. Over the past 6 years we've really put ourselves in a financial hole that is just getting worse. He needed a job but didn't have a license so he ended up getting a news paper route in my name but he gets paid cash and he hasn't been saving taxes and I know at the end of the year it'll be me getting slammed with thousands of dollars of more debt.

I have completely lost sexual interest in him. I can't pinpoint when or why but for about two years I can't bring myself to want to have sex with him. I haven't initiated it even once. I know that this effects his self esteem and we do fight about it. He often tries and about half of the time I turn him down. We have a good relationship but it's honestly feeling more like a great friendship. I know he still loves me but I definitely think it's lost its luster. I want to go back to school and start a new career and he is really holding me back. He is very interested in video games, weed and spending unnecessary money when all I want is to get out of debt and maybe have a house and a family. I do everything around the house and he never helps. He's very controlling when it comes to me having friends or a social life yet he does what ever he would like. I feel so trapped. I know I was mentally abusive for a long time. We have both done our fair share of damage but he always wants to work it out when I am just sick and tired of this. 

I am afraid to hurt him because I do love him. I know he doesnt have many options and will be very embarrassed if we broke up. I also fear I will regret it in the long run or end up alone. I've given so much for this that to end up with nothing seems exhausting but I don't know if this will ever turn around and get better. I've found myself starting to find interest in other people. I don't know anymore. I feel so lost. Anyone been in this situation? Am I too young to be in an unhappy marriage? Will the sexual desire ever come back?",relationship_advice

t3_ch8ooe,*help* I think I lost my chance with the girl of my dreams,"Just looking for some advice, I included some context (which is pretty long) to help you understand. There’s a tl:dr and some questions at the bottom of the post because I don’t know what to do and this girl is stuck in my head. Thanks.

It started on my first day at a new school.  However this “first day” was different. I actually knew the people at this school, and had built up a nice circle of friends through online gaming. I was sitting in the office, waiting to be picked up and escorted to the room where we would then register every morning for the ten months that followed. I saw one of my good friends, whom I had seen only once before, and a girl who came with him. I was in their class, and they had come to pick me up. I had said hello to my friend and said hello to this amazing girl. We shook hands and introduced ourselves. I had seen photographs of her but she looked even better in person. And I just couldn’t get over her voice.

About a week had passed and we were beginning to know each other pretty well. I was stupid and started bragging about all the sorts of drugs I had done. I could tell she was unimpressed. However, I learned that she smoked. I was hooked on that shit too. She suggested that we make a pact to stop smoking. I agreed and honoured the pact with 101% conviction. I went on to stop smoking for around 4 months. At the end of those four months is when the story gets a little bumpy. 

My history and luck with girls was pretty poor, and I needed a new plan-of-action. I used to go around telling the whole world whenever I fancied someone, but I learned that doing so was not such a good idea. So this time around, I thought that I should get to know her and work on establishing myself as one of her friends and go from there. At this point in time we were really good friends and I thought that there would be no better time to seize the opportunity so I devised a plan. I organised a small party with some close friends and invited the girl. There was going to be some alcohol involved which I thought would get the wheels moving and help me overcome my fears and tell her how I feel. 

It is now the night of the party and everything is going well. Everyone’s a bit tipsy, and we’re all having a good laugh. We got closer and started talking, it was the perfect moment to tell her. But, I was still too afraid to say anything. Then everything had to go tits up. One of my friends bragged about how good he was at drinking and downed about a bottle’s worth of Gin. He was now throwing up all over the place including on himself. Another friend lobbed a massive tube of PVC towards my mate. People were drunk, angry, and bleeding. I tried helping out but it was too much to handle. She suggested going to a nearby supermarket with my best mate to get water for everyone. I agreed and helped out as much as I could at the party. The supermarket was 5 minutes away and they had been gone for 20. I knew something was up, and we all really needed the water. I left the party and made my way towards the supermarket when I saw flashing lights and heard voices coming from a defunct toilet. I went to investigate. Long story short, I found her and my best mate. I was mortified. 

For the rest of the night I was in a bad mood. I drank some more. I got so drunk I started crying, at which point I decided to tell her how I felt. She dismissed everything I said and told me “I don’t think this is the real you, tell me the same thing Monday morning”. She then left and we all went home. The following Monday I was in our classroom sitting in my seat as per usual. I sat there, quietly. She then approached me and asked me if I remembered anything from the party. I made the biggest mistake of my life and said “No”. I laughed it off and told her I was too drunk to remember anything, but really I was so embarrassed and angry at what had happened that I couldn’t say anything. She seemed disappointed and walked away. 

Our relationship as “friends” slowly deteriorated. After the party, another best mate told me that she said that I should’ve made a move and now, (coming directly from her) she says that she always saw me as a friend. Currently, we are barely on talking terms. We just say hello or goodbye. Good morning or good afternoon. I still have feelings for this girl and I don’t want this to sound premature but I think I love her? 

What makes the pain worse is that people thought we dated or think we should date. I’ve been to parties since this has happened and people come up to me and ask “so how are you and (girl’s name)”, “she must be so proud of you especially for not seeing anyone else” or “you two would be so good together”. 

It’s been two years since that “first day” and I can’t stop thinking about her. I can’t see myself being with anyone else other than her. 

tl;dr
I meet a girl, at a new school and she’s gorgeous 
We become good mates
I organise a party so I can tell her how I feel about her
We get super close 
She gets with my best mate at party
Regret, regret, regret
I tell her I fancy her, she doesn’t believe me because I’m drunk 
Asks me if I remember confessing the following school day and I pretend that I don’t remember anything because I’m so embarrassed 

*Hearsay* she said that I should’ve made a move
Later on, she says she always regarded me as a friend

People thought or still think we’re a couple.
Pain.

t3_chdvjd,Why Does my (25 F) ex (25 M) still contact me a year after a break up he wanted?,"Never thought I would ever post on this forum but here we go.

Myself and my ex broke up a year ago and he still messages me every month/few weeks to ask me how I am (I have never once instigated the conversation), compliments me, asks questions about my life and tells me he wants to meet up, but when the time comes it never turns into plans. The break up was mainly his decision, he’s recently asked me if I’m seeing anyone and has drunkenly called me twice this week saying he misses my parents and me, that he was in a ‘bad place’ when we broke up and is ‘excited to see me’.

I’ve told him many times he can’t not follow through on meeting up as it’s disrespectful and he’s said he ‘promises we will meet up soon etc etc’ 

I don’t believe I would still want to pursue anything romantic with him as I do believe I’ve outgrown him now, but I would like to pursue a friendship as we said when we broke up and go from there, just not sure where to go from here, should I ignore him? It’s been a year now and it’s tiring. 

He’s not stopped me from moving on, I’ve been dating people since.

I’ve told friends and family about this situation and they have no explanation and are as confused as me. I know the best thing to do would be to ask him but he won’t solidly give me an answer. 

What would you do? And any guys what do you think his game is? 

Any perspective would be great as I’m confused and would be lying if I said I didn’t think about him everyday.

First of all, there has been twice now, I think, that I decided to cut her out of my life and I ended up contacting her again. Which I think is kind of shitty of me. I don't know why I keep cutting her and then going back to her. But it's been maybe 7 or 8 years since I last did that. (There were valid reasons why I did it in the past, she had a habit of ditching me for guys she was dating).

&amp;#x200B;

She is severely depressed. And she has major anxiety, the worst I've ever seen. She has two kids and it's gotten so much worse since having them. She got pregnant and then moved in with her boyfriend and they got married shortly after. She constantly accused him of cheating on her pretty much since day one. Her life basically spiraled out of control to today, where she is the worst hoarder I've ever seen. She has several animals that piss and shit all over the house. Her house is so messy you can't even see the floor and it's incredibly dirty and reeks of animal piss and rotting food. Last time I went to her house, went in her sons room and there was literally dog poop on the floor mixed in with his toys. You can literally smell her house from the end of the driveway. Every time I see her in person she looks like she hasn't showered in weeks and she smells like cat piss. I have considered calling CPS on her several times, but I already know she gets CPS called on her at least once or twice a year, I'm assuming by neighbors or something. So I'm not sure it would help her, tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

I barely have anything in common with her anymore other than our long history of being friends. We have a small close group of friends, there's 4 of us girls. We talk in a group text regularly and I'm ashamed to say that three of us have a separate group chat away from her where we regularly talk about her. We've talked about planning an intervention but we haven't gone through with it yet. We are all too afraid it would make her worse. We have a hard time talking to her a lot in regular conversation because she says really weird things. For instance, one friend brought up how her dog pooped in the bed and she had to get up in the middle of the night to clean it up and her husband just groaned and went to sleep somewhere else instead of helping. Well, the other friend (one this post is about) says: ""When my kid pukes in our bed I just leave it for my husband to clean up. That'll teach him a lesson."" Mind you, she is a stay at home mom and her husband works over 60hrs per week to not even make ends meet (they live off of every program you can imagine just to get by). She complains that her kids and husband are the reason the house is so messy and she is always pissed at her husband for not cleaning the house (even though he works almost every waking hour and she stays at home).

&amp;#x200B;

I used to go over to her house regularly (at least once a week) and hang out with her for several hours because I wanted to keep her company because she was so depressed and lonely. I used to come do her dishes and sweep her floor and whatever else. I can't bring myself to help her anymore, it's been years and it's getting worse. I actually recently decided I am not going to her house at all anymore. I think I'm not letting her over to my house anymore either because last time she came over to hang out, she brought fleas into my house (and I have a suspicion that when my dogs got fleas last year it may have been from her too). It's also hard to hang out outside of our homes because she is constantly broke, and it always comes down to me paying for her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at the point where I am not sure I can continue being friends with her. I don't know what to do. We have such a long history together and I feel like I'm being shitty but her life is just spiraling worse and worse out of control and I don't know what I can do. Can I continue being friends with her? What should I say to her? I should add that I also suffer from some anxiety and depression of my own (not nearly at the caliber of hers), and I have a hard time with confrontation so I would struggle with having a ""real talk"" with her.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT

tl:dr Pretty much what the title says: My friend is **severely** depressed and her life is spiraling out of control and I don't feel close to her like I used to. Should I stop being her friend?",relationship_advice
t3_chduhh,My (M22) father (M59) has said hurtful things and denies it,"Hi y'all. This is a bit of a can of worms; I'll try to sum things up as best I can.

I've been spending the week at my parents' place to get away from my daily life a bit. I've been struggling with major depression for the last few years and had really begun to let myself go - I quit my awful dayjob, let my place turn into a dump, have been living at night, losing control of my finances and becoming more and more lonely and isolated.

My dad showed up and decided to help me clean the place up, and drove me home. All was good for the first few days. I don't see my parents very often and often feel guilty about this, so I felt good, and so did they.

Last night at dinner however, the conversation shifted to my friends and relationships. 

My dad was a (failed; hasn't worked in over 20 years) musician and taught me guitar when I was a kid. Music became my number 1 passion, along with films. So I formed a band and joined some others and naturally started hanging with like-minded people. I made many friends in college (dropped out after 2 years) and later, film school (graduated).
But sometime after I left high school my dad had shifted gears and suddenly stopped supporting my decision to pursue music. Why not a doctor or a lawyer instead, you know the drill.

It's hard because he keeps sending me money when I explicitely tell him not to, to let me figure things out on my own; and then guilt-trips me for that. ""You have no idea how much we're sacrificing for you"" - yes, I do, but I wish you wouldn't. How am I supposed to get my act together if I never NEED to. I realize this makes me sound like a spoiled brat, but it's true. My parents don't have a lot of money, and go to great lengths to try and help me financially; but I'd trade that away in an instant if it meant we could just be closer on an emotional level. My dad also pressures me somewhat to ""make it"" so that I can take care of them when my mom retires, and frequently calls me ungrateful.

To this, add the fact that my first and only girlfriend, with whom I stayed for 2 years during film school and has since remained my closest friend, ran into hardship and I thus let her stay at my place for the entire relationship. My dad, who pays the rent, was always against this.

So yesterday at dinner he started going off on me about how all my friends are hobos and free-loaders (not only is this false, he's never even met any of them), how I surround myself with ""losers"" to feel better about myself, and how he doesn't understand how I'm still friends with my ex. When I tried to defend myself he told me ""I know how you are around women, not one of them ever wanted you before or since her, that whore only got with you because she needed a place to stay.""

I have never felt so hurt by him in my entire life. I didn't say anything and left the room. Today my mother, who was obviously appalled, convinced me to try and talk to him and work things out. He at first refused, and then denied saying what he said. He claims I only heard what I already think of myself. Same shit at dinner an hour later.

For context, I had a hard time making friends as a kid, and was always bullied, which he once claimed to be ashamed of. He never, ever taught me anything about girls and flirting, so I had a hard time with that as well. The closest we got to that was when he caught me masturbating once when I was 14, and went on a furious rant about how ""there's more to life than touching your dick all the time."" Oh, and how ashamed he was that his ""son is into fat fucking whales"" (i was looking at Scarlett Johanson, but fair enough).

They sent me off to boarding school in the city when they moved to the country-side (I was 13), and after that I lived with my emotionally abusive grandma for 2 years (a story for another time). So I drifted further and further away from my dad and now we're unable to communicate beyond small talk; any attempts to open up to him always end badly. About two to three times a year, like clockwork, my dad decides I'm a failure, freaks out, then refuses to talk to me for months on end. Then things get better again, rinse, repeat.

I thought he'd be happy that I finally made friends, became romantically active (only one gf but lots of other, short-term relationships), got my degree, started moving forward. But I also went through a ton of bad stuff and got depressed, and that's all he seems to see.

In any case I plan to see a therapist as soon as possible because if I can't get through to him, then I at least want to get better and become 100% financially independant, and that's gonna be impossible if I can't get out of fucking bed every day. My self-esteem and confidence had gotten really good, then plummetted again, and I'm beyond sick of it.

The reason I'm posting this is to get some perspective. My dad thinks he's beyond reproach because he takes care of me financially, and I don't know how to improve the relationship. I know I need to get my shit together and I fully intend to, but at this point it's more in order to get away from him than anything else. I just want to make him proud, but what he said to me yesterday is changing the way I see him for the worse. I don't think he had a right to say that.

TL;DR : Dad thinks I'm a clueless,ungrateful free-loader who surrounds himself with ""losers"" and ""whores."" I've been depressed for a long time and want to get my shit together but I can't accept his words; looking for perspective and advice.",relationship_advice
t3_chgkd1,Is my friend into me?,"So recently my school had their prom, obviously I went with my friends and we had a great time, but one of my friends who is a girl let’s call her “Daisy” during the dancing had grinded on me to my surprise, me being in the music just went with it, but the reason why it really shocked me is because she has a boyfriend who I am good friends with.

Anyway when they went outside together and I sat with them, she had no issue touching my face and as soon as she could, asked me who I would want to fuck the most I jokingly answered her just to avoid an awkward scene as I played it off as a joke.

Soon later a fire alarm went off and we were forced to stand outside, Daisy sat on a wall outside the prom place and as her boyfriend walked off asked me to pick her up, I did and not wanting her boyfriend to have a negative reaction quickly handed her to him and he brought her back into the prom area, for the rest of the night we sat around and just talked.

It only occurred to me after that she may have been hitting on me and trying to cheat on her boyfriend but I dunno, we still talk pretty often but maybe I’m reading it wrong, my relationships with women haven’t always worked out.

Btw there was no alcohol at the prom or involved.",relationship_advice

t3_chdru8,Not over my last relationship but now involved with someone new.,"I [26f] was told by my exbf[30m] a couple months ago that he no longer loves me but wanted to work it out after manipulating me for 3 months. he didn’t touch me, wouldn’t kiss me, wouldn’t hold my hand, or tell me he loved me. For 3 months. We were only dating for like a year? He kept telling me how much he loved me, how appreciative he is of me (I worked full time plus a side job plus working on my degree, along with keeping the house clean and cooking him lunch and dinner every day.) but it was excuse after excuse. He said he didn’t like touching me if he was drunk, which he was drunk every night. He didn’t like his haircut. He didn’t like how he looked.  

I told him either him or I will be moving out of the house we were renting (he moved in with me because he was in a financial hard place.) I could afford rent myself. He could not. Told him I’d pay all the fees to break the lease if he’d just fuck off. I also gave him the rent money he gave me back. 


Deleted him off all social media, blocked his number, absolute no contact. Moved out of state to a big city rooming with family and have a new amazing job. Saving up for my own place.  


Got Tinder a few weeks ago. Met this man. He invites me over to his house almost every day and we go on hikes, swim in the river, come up with business ideas (we’ve made a little money off some graphics we designed together,) cuddle and watch Anime on the weekends and fall asleep. He cooks me dinner every time I see him. he’s intelligent, stable income, ambitious and outrageously sexy. But we’re taking relationship stuff slow. No talks of commitment, which is great right now since I’m not ready and he feels the same way. We’re just having a lot of fun together and he’s becoming my best friend. 

Last night on twitter, I see a post that a mutual friend liked. It was my ex. With this woman he swore he wasn’t cheating on me with (they hung out often and drank together regularly alone.) they were kissing in the picture. 

This all happened when the new guy and I were cuddled up on the couch at 2am and he was showing me funny tweets. 

I was immediately furious while I was hand in hand with such a great guy. It just threw me for a loop. I’ve never been so pissed off at an ex in my life. It ruined my night completely. 

I don’t know if I have feelings for my ex still. I don’t know if I’m just pissed that he treated me like dirt and he’s still coming back into my life. I’m pissed at myself I didn’t block him on twitter. I so badly just wanted to call him and scream “fuck you!!” 

It made me realize that I’m not over the breakup. And I don’t know if it’s right to keep seeing this guy if I feel it’s going towards a romantic relationship. I’ve been crying for the past couple hours thinking about how deeply the breakup really affected me. I’m stupid for getting tinder too soon. I just really wanted to get laid but I’m so bad at one night stands obviously. Just lost. 


TLDR; ex bf said he didn’t love me. I kicked him out and moved to another state. A month+ later I get tinder and meet a great guy. After a couple weeks of seeing him I find out my ex is now dating this woman he said he wasn’t cheating on me with. It made me reflect and not sure if I’m actually over the breakup. And if I should continue seeing this guy since it doesn’t feel fair for him.",relationship_advice
t3_ch8jd8,"Dating a divorced guy, whose ex wife is GORGEOUS.","Hey guys! 

I am looking for some relationship advice here, maybe from someone who’s been in the same position. 

I met my boyfriend about 4 months ago ,he’s 33, divorced and has two beautiful children who live with their mom in a different state. I am 25, have barely started my career and have had a long relationship but no marriages or children.  We have similar tastes, interests, beliefs, we go to the same church, same sense of humor, values, goals, it feels like our time together just flies by. We are in love, I can feel it, and have been inseparable. 

I have recently met his parents and they are wonderful and welcoming, his mother is a sweetheart and has really been making an effort to connect with me. 
I have also met his siblings who are equally as sweet.  His sister’s wedding is coming up in 6 weeks and she and her fiancé invited me to come along with my boyfriend, which made me really happy but also brought up some issues. 

His children come to visit often and I have not met them before as we had just started dating, but they’re coming again for the wedding and I will be meeting them that week! I absolutely love children and have been super excited about meeting his little ones, the issue is that his ex wife wants to talk to me before I meet them, which I can (kinda) understand. I had never seen pictures of her before and so I looked her up on Facebook. She. Is. GORGEOUS. And as soon as I looked through her Facebook, all my insecurities washed over me. 

She is the one who asked for the divorce 5 years ago and I feel like had she not, they would definitely still be together. She is successful, looks flawless, they were high school sweethearts and she’s the mother to his two beautiful children.
I feel like I am the consolation prize. I’m not as successful, definitely not as pretty and in shape, and I just feel like they have already shared all the “firsts”. I feel like if I stay in this relationship I am forever going to be more excited about things than he is, if we ever get engaged it won’t be his first time, it won’t be his first wedding, first honeymoon, first time dad. He’s already lived all of that, with someone a lot prettier. 

I am completely in love with this man and he’s never given me a reason to feel the way that I feel right now. He’s thoughtful, kind, respectful, attractive, and he always makes sure that I am happy and comfortable . I don’t want my insecurities to affect our dynamic in any way, specially now that I am about to meet his children. I need to find a way to get over it. 

Have you ever been in a similar situation? How did you deal with your insecurities?

t3_chggyd,Forgiving a Brother,"Hey Guys, this one is a stumper for me. I'll try to keep it short. 

    My wife and I have been married for Two years. A mutual friend hooked us up, and we hit it off. The three of us spent 3 years as a singular unit, overcoming homelessness, heartache, and more. 
    This mutual friend of ours was a very emotional guy, not nesscecarily in a bad way, but he was prone to psychotic breaks. Eventually things came to a head when we discovered a fake Facebook account he had been using in an attempt to blackmail my wife for nudes. We discovered soon after that he had been dealing with some serious psychological stress, and turned to Methamphetamines and alcohol to cope with his own relationship's failure. All in the course of a month our friendship dissolved as he threatened to do everything from murder us, have our child taken away, and commit suicide. It felt to me like this dude was SERIOUSLY manipulative, so we kicked him out of our shared home. Before he left town, he came to my place of work to impart one last piece of information. At the very beginning of our Budding romance, he and my wife had gotten high and had sex...

    Whew, roller coaster, am I right? 
    Now, 3 years later, the memory of our best friend gone bad has mostly faded into the background. My wife and I have worked through their indescretion, and have formed a happy family with three beautiful daughters. All's good in the hood, right? Nope. This morning, my wife received a Friend request on social media from our estranged best friend. They spoke all day about how he is doing better. He sought psychiatric help, kicked the drugs, moved back nearby, and would like to ""pick up where we left off, before all the bad shit"". 
    My wife is eager to invite him over for dinner on the weekend, and get reconnected. I am not. I feel that I have grown past it, and don't wish to invite trouble into an already turbulent adult life. 
   To be honest, I really liked the guy. We went through so much shit together that it's sometimes hard to see through the rose colored glasses and remember all the terrible things that he did... but now, more than ever, I am conflicted. If he has worked hard and overcome his issues, he deserves a second chance. On the other hand, my gut is telling me to stay well away from him after all he has done. 
    I have told my wife that I don't want him around my house, or children, but that I won't stand in the way of their re-bonding, should that be what she wants to do... 
   So... am I being paranoid and controlling? How do y'all think I should handle this?",relationship_advice
t3_ch9tu4,I (21f) feel emotionless and trapped in a relationship w my long-term BF (26m)," 

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 2 years, pretty good relationship overall, thinking about moving in together in the near  future. I am currently working in a different country on a project for  the summer. For weeks leading up to me leaving we've been having some  serious issues, but we got over them (too) quickly because didn't want  to separate on a bad note. To summarize it in a few sentences: he is a  very emotional guy, and I try to support him and make him feel good in  every way possible. At the same time, my emotional needs are not met,  and it is that difficult for him to completely dismiss my concerns at  times. It feels like he prioritizes everyone but me sometimes, and most  definitely puts himself first. When it I bring it up to him, he claims  that he is trying his best and wonders how I see it. After many more  painful hours of discussions he finally sees my point, agrees with me  and apologizes. A few days go by, and the cycle continues all over  again.  


Surprise surprise, it got worse  once I went to a new country. We ended up in a cycle of blaming each  other and constantly picking fights. It was a huge blow to my well  being, ever since our last fight I have been feeling pretty emotionless  towards him. I love him still, I care about him, but it is difficult for  me to express those feelings, because I am disappointed by how much he  is capable of hurting me. I do think that we will stay together, and  work things out with a help of counseling, but I do not see this issue  getting resolved before I move back to the country where both of us  reside permanently. I found good support system in a new country and it  is almost insane how people who do not know that well are able to  support you better than a person you're trying to build your whole  future with.  


Recently, he visited, and we  spoke about it. I told him I wanted to take things slow, and come to a  place where I do not feel like I am forced to feel a particular way. He  got upset, he told me he loved me, and that he was hurt to see that I am  feeling emotionless towards our relationship. The next few days after  this convo were hell. He told me he sometimes thinks I would be better  off with someone else, that he felt horrible about himself, and that I  was not as excited about him as I was in the beginning of our  relationship. He cried for hours. I did not want to hurt him, so I  reassured him and told him basically what he wanted to hear, but it  definitely felt forced. I do not understand why he feels totally okay  being openly negative about things, and I am the one who has to put a  mask on and keep it together. I think he's done the worst possible thing  coming here with this mindset, and it almost made things worse. I feel  like it is getting a bit too much for me, I am tired. I know he is being  genuine, but somehow I feels like once again he is more concerned with  everything that he is feeling atm.

I guess  there is no big question here to be answered, but what would be your  advice? How does this look from a side? Am I being too harsh?",relationship_advice
t3_chdm3a,Me (29f) and my boyfriend (27m) had a very small argument that spiraled out of control and made me question the foundation of our relationship. Am I overreacting?," 

Hi Reddit, first post and it’s gonna be a messy one, please bear with me...

So me (f, 29) and my boyfriend (m, 27) of one year just got into a small argument which spiraled way out of control and I’m not sure how to feel about it. I have a history of reacting overly emotional but him telling me not too make a bigger deal out of it than it is and that everything was fine seems like a very underwhelming and unjust response. Help me get some clarity?

A bit of background: Basically, we were very casual for a while before we got exclusive, but from day one I felt like we had a connection and were texting so much even when we couldn’t see each other. For him, although he is a loner and prefers not to have close friends irl, this is very normal, for me not so much. Texting may be my least favorite form of communication, but with him I just couldn’t stop. We were talking very openly about philosophical and hypothetical matters, but I could feel he was holding back and he’d only reveal very vague details about his life for a long time. This changed drastically when he asked me to play world of warcraft with him, which is an important aspect of his life, while I had not played any video games before. I felt like it broke a wall between us and I told him as much, even wrote him an essay about what that game had come to meant to me in the sense that I was getting to know him so much better. But I still felt some hesitation from him about sharing his thoughts, emotions and private moments with me. I told him several times and very explicitly that if ever there’s anything to be talked about, we shouldn’t hold back, that I wish he’d still be more open with me and that, even though we were becoming serious, there was a definite imbalance of things he knew about me and I knew about him. While we do have many ups and downs (me with my hightened emotions, him with a history of depression and emotionally instable/abusive upbringing), I think we both felt a stronger connection through every struggle we have overcome and we’re starting our life together and will be moving in together. Since it has become clear that I am now a part of his life as much as he is of mine, I’ve asked him to share more details about his family/friends, but I don’t want to push him on it. I trust him completely and I know he shares everything he deems important.

Back to today. He’s been having a lot of stress at work and when I asked him about it recently he said he’d prefer not to talk about it since he wants to keep work stuff at work, which wouldn’t work for me, but I can’t and don’t want to force it. I ask him how he’s doing with everything, I ask him if there’s anything I can do for him, I let him know that I’m here for him. But if I feel he doesn’t want to share, I am very hesitant to push. Well today he told me that would very much have liked to tell me more about it but he didn’t fell I was interested, so he didn’t. At that point I thought „How can this be, the topic of me wanting to know more and him not sharing comes up almost weekly and more often than not, very explicitly“. I told him this and he said „Ok, I’ll try and get back to the way I was before.“ I was confused as to what he meant, since as far as I knew, he had always been one to keep things to himself. When I asked him about it, he said „Well I guess since before we were exclusive I felt you had no interest and so I stopped sharing things with you“ and honestly, my heart is breaking right now. He explained that maybe it had to do with the fact that I was a „slave without personality“ (he has told me before that he felt I was very emotionless in the beginning). I kind of know wher he’s coming from, since I always hold my emotions back if it’s just casual dating. But even so we had talked about this very openly and he knew from the very beginning that once I let someone in, they’re going to get the full ride.

I am so deeply hurt, that he would make a choice not to share with me again and again even to this point in our relationship, when I very clearly told him many many times with my words and actions that open communication is so important and that he’s hurting me by keeping tings to himself. I don’t know how to talk to him right now because I  feel like the ground is crumbling beneath my feet and that somehow we both made the other person to be something they are not.  I’m sad because I feel like I don’t know him like I thought I did, I’m angry because I know he knows me better than to tell me not to make a big deal about it. I’m disappointed for all the times he told me I’m holding back and he wishes we were closer, he was holding back himself. And at the same time I feel so incredebly stupid because I always had this little voice in my head asking me „How can someone who’s so communicative and enjoys to talk to strangers on the internet not enjoy to share things with his girlfriend, whom he loves and trusts?“

I’m seriously confused. Am I overreacting by being hurt and disappointed? Should I have kept pushing him as a sign of interest? I know there’s a zero percent chance of us actually breaking up over this, but should I let it go and play nice, just because he doesn’t understand the depths of  hurt his behaviour has caused me not only today but ever since we met? 

By the time I finished writing this he has told me that it’s not a good situation, but it’s not worth fighting about. Especially since I’ll be away for the weekend and tomorrow is our last chance to spend some time together and have a proper goodbye. He hopes I won’t destroy everything by creating a situation like I always do. 

We've talked a little bit and I'm not sure we're in the same conversation. We definitely tackled some issues that we both said we'd work on (me trying not to interrupt him when he talks, him sharing stuff even though he gets the impression I'm not interested), but somehow my feelings still feel invalidated. By this point, I don't think prolonging the conversation will do any good, but I still think some clarity on the subject, if I'm giving this too much thought, would help me calm down.

   UPDATE HE GAVE ME A REASON, seems like a total lie. 


Your fault? It was really nothing. I was scrolling through my fb and Gabriel (his M16 brother) was like oh who’s that and I was like a girl I went to school with. He ask if she had other pictures but I didn’t wanna go through her shit so I told him I’d show him later when I found one. I wasn’t gonna send it to him cuz I knew something like this would happen. So I was gonna show him and then take it off but I forgot I even had it. I never got to show him....",relationship_advice

t3_chgd2n,My [20M] sex frequency with my gf [20F] of 1 year is crashing,"Backstory: 20M here with my gf 20F of 1 year. Sex with my gf has been dwindling down lately, the last time we did the deed was roughly 2.5 months ago. We're both students (2nd year tertiary education) at the moment. She revealed a week ago that we will completely stop having sex until we graduate because she is nervous of having an accident even though we uses condoms all the time and I even suggest we won't have penetration sex, just eat each other. I love this girl very much but I don't think I can wait for that long. I'm puzzled by my conflicting hormones and emotion. When we were first together, frequency is usually once a month.

t3_chans0,A Girlfriend tells me I stress her out and give her bad vibes,"Hello, so basically we've been dating for **over 2 years now** (**We are both 19**) and we have a distance relationship (**400KM, Czech, Poland**), in which we see each other every month for about a week and spent all last summer together, ofc we spent every holiday together, too.

&amp;#x200B;

We've been dating since **June 2017.**

**At December 2018**, she told me she might be unsure about her sexuality(she thought she is into girls),  she felt lost and it was looking bad, after me leaving my family for ALL Christmas and trying to figure out everything,it took her about a A week or two to think and she realized, it was just something weird and then we had another beautiful 7 months of nothing like that.

&amp;#x200B;

She was here at my mom's wedding at **May 2019** and it was all nice, too.

We talk in english, but she actually knows czech well after those 2 years and talked to my mom too normally alone finally.

&amp;#x200B;

We were slowly getting into position where, she was actually about to leave her place and live with me, together, here in my country.We were getting flat, my mom helped a lot and family was supportive, my family loves her actually.

She was happy to leave her country, because she just feels stressed there because of her grandparents she lives with and other things and it's nothing for her.My city is 5x Smaller, she feels good here and we could have promising future here.

&amp;#x200B;

We moved the moving date, though.

And agreed to do it at the end of **THIS SUMMER**, things got a little twisted again after a week and she decided that she wants to do college and that its too stressing to change country and stuff to which i completly understood, but then she started talking about how she doesn't know herself and started having these emotional roller coasters and I wanted to know what's wrong, but there was no help to her, everything ended that "" I don't understand "" (her words).

She said she doesn't know anything about herself. &lt; Her exact words.

I have no idea what it meant. She said she is not sure about her favorite color even.

Well, she made an appointment with a doc and wants to go back on pills she used to be ( BEFORE ME ), to be stress free and function like a human. She has problems with everyday tasks, most likely.

Buses, trams and thigs like that stresses her and she can't do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I agreed, as long as it helps her, no matter how i am against pills and stuff. But that therapy might help her.

&amp;#x200B;

Anway, it started twisting again and it ended out of nowhere, 10 hours before my bus to her place, when I was supposted to visit her. She broke up with me. Wanted me not to hate her, that she is not ready for relationship and she can't see me. (So I didnt go), after giving her few days to think, we talked about some of the stuff she left here(Cause she was supposted to move)  , that i was supposted to send to her back, I asked her if it's possible so she can be open minded and maybe we can be back together, after she goes to therapy and i would focus on myself in that meantime, too.

(I wasn't completly nice to her, when i felt like she was distancing, i wanted her to give me attention, and not keep the problems to herself, and i was just kinda not happy she spends time with friends instead and then overthinks everything at night, alone)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*She said, that she can't be with me, i stress her out, i give her bad vibes.\*\*And kinda refused the open minded thing, that we can be back together, when she feels okay with herself and i would calm down, too and would stop being toxic towards her friends, no matter how much time she spents with them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What went wrong and how do I give her bad vibes? I don't insult her, i try to be funny around her, we all do kind of stuff and idk, it felt like super different and nice when we were in person together.

&amp;#x200B;

What can i do about it and is there any chance, she might give us a chance?

Also, I can't be friends with someone, who I have feelings for and I want to cut her off, if she is not gonna be a little open minded in the future (if she would do that, i would keep contact), I don't want to sound like a jerk, it's just.. my mentality, I can't. I wouldn't handle it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: She doesn't have it easy at her place, she doesn't feel  good here, never did, always complained and she was getting insulted by her Grandfather for wanting to move. I don't think that helped it too.",relationship_advice

t3_ch8d5o,I [26m] feel unappreciated in my current relationship and am tired of being yelled at for trying to practice self care and for minor mess ups.,"
Edit: I want to be clear, I don't mind going to her place in the middle of the night because she was freaking out. What I mind is getting yelled at the next day for misplacing her laser pointer.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year and have been getting into more and more fights. My main issue is how often she yells at me over minor things. I work 80-100 hour weeks (cutting it down to 40-50 by the end of August, the work load is killing me) and will get yelled at for staying at my home on occasion instead of coming over because I need rest. I also get yelled at over small things with no credit given to any positive thing I do. For example, 2 nights ago she called me in a panic because she had never done edibles before and had consumed an edible that contained 35mg of thc, causing her to freak out and become very paranoid. I drove 40 minutes to her house through the rain at night and stayed up with her until 2 a.m. even though I had to be up at 5 a.m. the next morning. At some point while staying up with her I used a laser pointer to mess around with her cat, and I guess I left it on the bed or something and it fell off so she couldn't find it the next day. So the next day, at around 9 p.m. while I'm asleep she calls and just tears into me about how much I don't care about her because I didn't put her laser pointer back where it came from. Now, I have an issue of putting things down randomly and not remembering where I placed them, an issue I've been working on, but this seems like a huge overreaction, especially when I further sleep deprived myself to come over and help her because she couldn't handle a fucking edible.

Tl;dr, what should I do? I love her but if these overreactions keep happening I'm not sure I can stick it out much longer, I hate feeling like I'm walking on eggshells.",relationship_advice
t3_chgcl3,I (26M) am unsure whether to message her (21f) again.,"Yo, I'll try and keep this short and sweet. A couple months ago, I met a girl through work in a kind of passing encounter. It was a short conversation with a little bit of flirting at the tail end. I'd asked her name during the conversation and decided to look her up on Facebook when I had a spare few minutes and decided I'd message her. It went well, we spent a week talking of and off and flirting. Bit of an age gap, she's 21 and I'm 26 but it seemed like she had her shit together (despite having a kid, which rang an alarm bell in my head but the dick knows what it wants.). We both basically said that we found the other attractive.   


So, after we'd spent about a week talking I thought I'd bite the bullet and ask if she was interested in going out sometime. She basically told me she'd only just gotten everything the way she liked it, had only just got out of a relationship and that her kid was a handful being as old as it was. Didn't exactly leave her with a lot of time. I'm an understanding guy, I have/had my own shit going on so I was like cool, no worries. If anything changes, hit me up, I'm easy.   


Anyway, the crux of my question is that it's been a couple months. We've spoken on and off, but mostly just friendly small-talk and life updates. I'm wondering whether to try again or just let it go. What do?",relationship_advice

t3_ch8x8q,Can a relationship survive without physical intimacy?,"My (M, 30) girlfriend (F,29) and I have been together for a year and a half now and things have going well!

We meet up every week to go the movies, dinner or just chill at the park.

The only issue I can see with this relationship is that there is a lack of physical intimacy between the two of us. Our emotional intimacy has definitely has improved in the recent months. We've been more open, honest and have expressed our feelings each other. 

When it comes to being physically intimate, we don't engage in any sort of ""activities"". My GF hates PDA and is somewhat shy around the public, so we rarely hold hands or give small kisses at the beginning/end of our dates. We don't makeout at all and when it comes to sexual acts, we have fun like twice a year. We sext frequently but that gets stale since we don't act on any of things we say. I've expressed my concerns to my GF and she said she'll engaging but I haven't seen any changes. 

She does get exhausted due to work and I respect that since she's working hard. Using your tired body as an excuse does get annoying after a while. I don't know what to do asides from keep on mentioning this topic to her. We have been arguing/debating a lot more since we're more open with each other. Being physically intimate will definitely help us relieve some of that stress from work and life - along with brining us closer.

t3_chgace,My best friend (M17) and I (F17) kissed but he has a gf and I have something complicated.,"Soooo the last month and a half I’ve been talking to this guy (m17) and it’s been weird. We aren’t dating but we did what couples did. Dates, kissing, meeting each other’s family’s etc. This past week he’s ignored me. Hasn’t talked to me or anything.  I try and hold conversation with him but he seems uninterested or seems to be trying to decide what he wants. I’m pretty sure I’ve fallen for him. Though I am not 100% bc I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’ve been close to relationships but not as close as this. 

Anyway. So my best friend and I have been best friends for 3 years. At first we started talking trying to date ( 3 years ago ). I cut it off bc I wasn’t attracted to him. This past year before he got his gf, we attempted dating. Failed. So we would occasionally make jokes about dating and it got to the point where it became serious. We’d ask each other what would happen if we kissed. Long story short we both said we would probably go with it. So fast forward to today. We had went to lunch together today. We don’t get the opportunity to hangout so this was the first time we hung out in 2 months. So afterwards we were talking in his car about everything. Like his gf, about the guy I’m attempting to keep talking to, about how we’re about to graduate. Then we started talking about how if one of us made a move what would we do.  Sooooo we were both honest about how we could get it out of the way and kiss. I was hesitant bc he has a gf and i didn’t wanna hurt their relationship. Though their relationship is awful bc she’s cheated but he’s too emotionally attached bc to end anything. So after a couple of minutes of me awkwardly laughing and debating we went ahead and kissed. I was expecting a peck. Umm no that’s not what happened he like full on made out with me. I could’ve stopped it the moment it happens but I didnt till after a minute. It was strange bc I felt nothing. I just felt someone I was kissing. No chemistry or anything. While he on the other hand was completely 100% into it. I’ve told him that I felt no chemistry there and that I felt guilty bc of his relationship and my hopefully soon relationship. I’m not sure what I should do. He won’t stop being my best friend but it’s just weird now. I wanna tell the guy I am talking to about it bc I believe honesty is very important. But I don’t wanna ruin what we’ve worked on. I know I made a bad decision to go with the kiss but we’ve known it was bound to happen soon. I think this kiss has confirmed my feelings for the guy I’m talking to.

t3_chg7sl,Fiancé has cut off all contact with me a month before I have his baby,"I will try to make this as short as i possibly can. 

I (26F) got pregnant shortly into my relationship with my “fiancé (24M) after black out drinking with him like an idiot. I should have recognized the red flags when he would barely consider an abortion, and very soon after I agreed to keeping it he wanted to propose to me, move in, and get our life started. I already have a child from a previous relationship and have done well at guarding him from my romantic life and have lived a comfortable life just me and him for years. I foolishly fell for everything he had to say though and thought maybe there was a chance we could make it work.

For a few months everything was great. He was a good partner to live with, we were excited about the baby, we communicated well, and I really did feel hopeful about the future. 

I think it all started when he went through my laptop and found old conversations and photos with exes. It’s like everything was downhill from there after it planted some sort of seed of insecurity in his mind. Of course I get it to an extent, but if you go searching for things you’re going to find them, and I can’t apologize for having a past before he was in my life.

All the ugly behavior I’m about to explain stems from his thoughts that he’s not good enough for me, I want other people, etc. It started when he would drink, this ugly side in him would come out. It would be some big dramatic episode every time he drank. He would apologize the next day and agree to quit drinking. Unfortunately over time he’s shown me that he is capable of these same behaviors even sober. Things have gotten bad- he’s taken my phone to go through it, forced himself into my bedroom and woken me up to fight, locked me out of the house when I would leave to avoid the fights, taken my car keys to prevent me from leaving, etc. It has progressively gotten worse. He admits he is the problem after he settles down, and cries and admits he is incredibly insecure and has anxiety about losing me and just loses it. He gets this crazy look in his eyes when he acts like this and it’s disturbing. He’s made promises to go to therapy and has his first appointment this week actually.  

As horrible as it all sounds, when it’s good, it’s great. I know I sound so foolish. But I really do love him and see a lot of my younger self in him and feel like he has the potential to overcome these unhealthy behaviors. I had a rough childhood (domestics violence, etc) and had to learn to outgrow a lot of unhealthy tendencies myself. It’s so difficult because he is so loving and caring at times, and other times is someone so different (typical abuser behavior or someone who just needs a little help? I don’t know). 

Our past argument was about ten days ago. He got aggressive with me and left. I asked him to stay with his sister and told him we needed a break and to focus on our baby that is coming in a month. A couple days go by and he came over to help me with finishing the nursery. He was upset and asking if we could still be together but that he would move out until we could fix our relationship. I’ve been so exhausted by it all that I told him I couldn’t focus on our relationship anymore and only wanted to focus on coparenting this child. Overall there was no fight though, and he left on good terms with me. We texted that night, and the following day. He was supposed to come over to finish the nursery and instead worked late and gave me the run around which is unlike him. I expressed my frustrations about feeling overwhelmed with everything we still had left to do. He stopped responding and that was the last I heard from him.

A couple days go by and nothing. He has blocked me on all social media.I reach out to his mother and sister- no response. They have been involved with his erratic behavior and maintained a generally neutral position on it all towards me but over time I have realized they totally baby him and enable him. I think behind the scenes they have been encouraging him to end this relationship with me and to move in with his sister. 

I come home from work on Friday and he has moved EVERYTHING out. He leaves his set of keys, but does weird things like taking out my engagement ring and leaving it sitting on my dresser, leaves me a pack of chocolate sitting on my counter, takes a framed photo of my child and me, and leaves a note saying he’s doing what he has to do to be the best dad he can be. That he wants to be involved in this baby’s life, that he still loves me and always will, but to not contact him until I’m in labor and that it will be up to me to find my ownway to the hospital?? I’m not even sure if he intends to be there, or just wants to know when this baby is actually born.

I reached out once more to try and make sense of all of this. He has never blown me off, if anything he has never given me the space I have asked for. I don’t understand how he went from wanting to fix our relationship to refusing to even discuss anything baby related with me?

And it gets better. On Monday I come home from work and find out he’s borrowed the key from my landlord. He entered my home and took back the engagement ring and all the warranty information to go along with it. He told the landlord he’s moved out and that he wants his name off the lease and has continuously pestered my landlord for his part of the security deposit back. He has deleted all photos of me on social media which he’s never been very active on. Now he’s suddenly posting selfies, updating his profile to make it seem like he’s super high up in his job, and is on a following spree of girls I assume. 

Still no communication from him or his family, who have always maintained that they want to stay out of things so they wouldn’t miss out on seeing the baby. I ensured them I would never keep them from the baby for his choices and behaviors. But now- how can I move on from this? I can’t even picture being in the same room as any of them. I feel like he is doing to me what I should have done to him months ago. I’m being ghosted as if I have been the abusive one and for some reason his family is going right along with it. 

I am depressed and hate myself for foolishly allowing my guard down and letting myself get into a situation like this. Not only am I hurt but my child is hurt and confused and keeps saying how much he misses this guy. What do I do? Have this baby alone and don’t contact him at all? Be the bigger person and tell him when I’m having the baby? I don’t know how to move on from this when I have so many unanswered questions.",relationship_advice

t3_chdbd3,My (24F) boyfriend (28M) doesn't have a phone and it's starting to really frustrate me,"My boyfriend and I have a generally great relationship. I'm very deeply in love with him, and we'll have been together two years this week. This all to say: **please don't advise that I break up with him with no other solution.** That isn't a course of action I want to take unless this is somehow an unsolvable issue.

All that being said, I (24) have been pretty frustrated lately. My boyfriend (28) doesn't have a phone currently, not even a phone with the service turned off where he could still use Messenger, etc. via wi-fi. He's able to call me from his house phone, but it's difficult for me to contact him first because I don't know when he's home, nor do I want to annoy those he lives with by calling all the time when he's not there. Additionally, we work pretty conflicting hours (I work M-F 9-5, he works most evenings and weekends) so by the time that I'm getting off work/have a day off, he's heading into work. By the time he gets home, it'll be late (after midnight at times) and he'll need to sleep so I'll get no call — which leads to days and days of not talking at all.

On top of all *this*, because of said work schedules, we're only able to see each other once or twice during the week. I'm starting to grow really frustrated and hurt that we'll see each other for maybe twelve hours and then I have no idea when I'll hear from him again.

I desperately miss texting him throughout the day, catching him up on my life and knowing what's going on in his. I can't ask him for time-sensitive advice on big life decisions that come up, or make time-sensitive plans. It's gotten to a point where I almost feel single in this regard. **I am fiercely devoted and would never ""act"" as if I were single in this regard,** but I mean in the sense that I don't have someone like a partner to talk with every day so I'm in my own head a lot.

At the core of it, it's a money issue — he's had a rough time lately mentally, and has had to focus resources on that, plus paying for some legal stuff irrelevant to this issue. Because of this, I feel bad pushing the issue and bugging him about when he's going to get another phone. It's a sensitive topic and I don't know if I should offer to buy him a phone (which wouldn't be above my means) when I can't afford to pay the bill moving forward. However, he also...doesn't seem to care and almost enjoys not having a phone? I don't think he understands how it's affecting me, though it kind of hurts that it feels like he doesn't want to talk to me (even thought that might not actually be the case).

I also want to take the opportunity to point out that all of these things separately don't bother me. Normally I wouldn't care when he takes a day to himself on his days off, but when it's the only time I get to spend time or meaningfully talk to him and he wants the day alone, that hurts. I wouldn't care if he didn't have a phone and we lived together, I wouldn't care (as much) if he had a phone that was just wi-fi enabled, I wouldn't even be as upset about our conflicting work schedules if we could fucking talk throughout the day. It's just all of these things compiled that make it frustrating and hurtful.

So my question is: how do I talk to him about this? It's been about a month at this point, and he keeps saying he's going to get a phone, but it's...just not emotionally feasible for me, you guys. This touches very heavily on some past relationship trauma for me so I need to do it when I see him (lest I end up in this cycle again) but I also don't want him to be hurt talking about a sensitive subject. He even said once after not contacting me for 2-3 days that he was afraid he had already lost me and I'm not there yet, but...it's getting close and I don't want to get there. I don't want to say that though and give him an ultimatum of sorts. 

So please, any advice would be appreciated. TYIA!

TL;DR: my boyfriend doesn't have a phone and that's our main form of communication. I'm hurt and frustrated and don't know how to talk to him about it.

**Update:** I had almost talked myself out of saying anything at all, but he could tell that something was up so I ended up just blurting it all out. Turns out he didn't realize how it was affecting me, and is going to prioritize fixing the issue at hand. All is well and I feel a lot better about the situation.

t3_ch4lnw,I (26F) have gotten really close to a newish friend (29F) and don’t know how to deal with her jealous best friend (29?F).,"Hi all,

I moved to a new state just over two years ago and got together with my current partner (29M) a couple months later. A few months after we met he brought me to meet some friends and I really hit it off with his friend’s girlfriend (now fiancé) who I will call A (29F). Due to the fact that both our partners are so close and A and I have a lot in common (similar career paths, similar interests, a lot of the same values and communication styles) we tend to spend a lot of time together both as a duo and as a group with our partners. We have had a lot of adventures, parties, etc together. We frequently talk about taking couple trips and sort of had one planned for August until it fell through due to finances. We do a lot of smaller double dates in our area.  

A and I have now been friends for like a year and a half and my partner and I see her and her fiancé at least 1-2 times a month. A couple months back I met my friend’s oldest friend who I will call D (29F I think) and we seemingly hit it off. I have a lot of respect for the oldest best friend position and the history/deep connection that comes with it (I have known one of my closest friends since we were 11) and I understand how history can effect a relationship; I try to leave space for that history/connection when we hang out. Overall I thought D and I were getting along well and I was happy about it. 

Tonight I talked to A on the phone for a while. We talk a lot and frequently talk about how we got really close really fast. A couple hours later D made a post on social media that was a screenshot of her text conversation with A talking about how she felt like someone A was getting close with was swooping in and stealing her best friend and how that person “drinks more and is more obnoxious.” A told her she was being ridiculous. 

I’m emotionally torn. My intuition and anxiety both tell me the post was about me based on my friendship trajectory with A and the conversation A and I had tonight (and the fact that I definitely drink more and have been around D a lot lately). However I’m a full grown ass adult and I don’t play those social media games- if anyone has a concern with me I need them to communicate with me clearly and we can talk it out. I want to let it go because I think my anxiety is getting the best of me in this situation but I also feel like a full on crazy person for thinking this is about me. How do you all move past that feeling? I don’t think this is worth confronting because I don’t know for sure but this is just triggering my anxious spiraling thoughts and is ruining my excitement to see both A and D this weekend. D is also coming to my house for our plans this weekend and I am not excited about that idea if I feel like I’m going to be shaded on the Internet. 

TL:DR A friend’s oldest friend is posting shady social media posts that I think are about me due to jealousy and it causes me to enter an anxious spiral that I don’t know how to stop.",relationship_advice
t3_chg48p,(F18) Stuck between breaking up with my (18M)...or not? Please help,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for over a year. There's been the fights, the arguments, the good and bad moments, and everything in between. Recently, I went on a trip to Iowa to visit my sister, and he acted weird the first three days out of the eight I was there, saying he missed me and that he couldn't wait till I was home. Plus he was very distant. Once I got home, things felt weird. And so, I told him everything I've been feeling for the past three months. In April, we got into a fight and I slapped him. He decided to slap me back. Ever since then things have been different and I feel like I haven't been as happy as before. He has a history of being controlling or making too many sexual jokes, but after I told him to stop with the jokes and chill on the controlling, he did. Although occasionally, he has his possessive moments. I'm a ovethinker and have thought breaking up was the best way to all our problems before, and I've almost done it about three times, but each time stopped.

Today we started talking about if we were in a healthy relationship. He realized how he's unfair and how he does things he shouldn't be doing. He said he's tried everything to change and we're running out of options. I brought up breaking up, thinking that if he didn't have anything else to do, why keep trying so hard?

But then I thought about it. I love him. I can't hurt him. I want a future with him. I don't know if I'm just scared of the future or just in a slump, but I don't know what to do. I can't think about letting him go. It hurts every time I do, and he doesn't want to let me go. I don't want to break up, but a small part of me feels like it's right.

I guess I'm just asking for advice on what to do. Should I break up with him or keep trying to fix something?

t3_chbkop,I (m21) am always overthinking the smallest issues in my relationship with my girlfriend (f22),"Hi. 

I’m always over thinking about how little issues in my relationship might pan out. It can be as small as a text she doesn’t reply to. 

Most recently she has gone away to a boarding school of opera for 4 weeks. She doesn’t have much time to talk and I knew this, however I still got concerned when she didn’t reply to my messages for a few hours. This has ended up in her asking me to give her some space for a few days until she comes home. I know this is probably for the best but i still keep worrying she might be thinking of breaking up with me or how our relationship might not be the same anymore. 

What I’m asking is how to calm my thoughts and stop overthinking everything to avoid this happening again?",relationship_advice
t3_chg369,How do I [17f] convince my dad [40s?M] to stay in the U.S? ( cross-post from r/relationships ),"okay so this is going to be a bit of a long one.
sorry for the formatting i'm on mobile

TL;DR: My dad is set on having me go to Mexico to study. He says he doesn't want me to deal with student loans. I don't really want to go because Mexico is so foreign to me. I'm lost and I don't want to disappoint my dad. 


some background first: 

I'm Mexican-American which plays an important part here because I was born amd raised in America and I have never even been in Mexico or been near Mexico at all. 

Although, I was raised with the culture and the language. English is actually my second language. I definitely could hold a conversation in Spanish but not an advanced one. I used to be as fluent as I am in English but going to American school made me lose the language that I did have. anyways my parents were born in mexico and immigrated to the US. 

I guess that makes me a first generation immigrant ( correct me if im wrong ) which is a big deal to my parents because they always like to remind me about the things they sacrificed so I could get better opportunities.

 I am also the youngest of my siblings and I turned out to be the sibling that did academically well in school. My two older siblings, to put it quite frankly, didn't really try in school. This puts me in tough position because my parents have a lot of high expecations for me. 

the problem:
Since I will be an upcoming senior in high school. I've had conversations with both my parents about where I would go to college. My dad very recently started pushing the fact that I go to study in Mexico. The idea is already kind of scary because it'll all be foreign to me and I think my Spanish skills aren't quite up to standard. 

the pros of going:
- a lot cheaper than going here in the states

- my dad owns apartments by the university he wants me to go to

- my dad won't have to break his back in order to provide for me ( i told him i would want to get a job while i study so i can help with paying but he wants to be able to send me money on his own

- being in a different environment than i am now


cons of going:

- I'll feel extremely lost

- I don't think I'd be able to make friends because I'm insecure about my spanish skills 

- my dad told me that im strictly there to study and if i wanted to go out i would have to go with my uncle

- my uncle lives very close by and i feel like my parents will make him constantly have an eye on me

- my mom warned me that there are dangerous parts of mexico and to not go anywhere alone

I'm an A and B student. Last I checked my GPA was a 3.7 ( I haven't checked since the beginning of the year but I'm pretty sure it went up ) I think I can manage to get some scholarships and lower the cost of attending university in the states. I just don't know how to convince my dad to let me stay. He said he doesn't want me to live with student loans so he thinks this is the next best option.

I would also like to mention that both my older siblings go to a community college nearby. I'm not sure why my dad has seemed to overlook that option.

What steps can I take to make sure I can affordably attend university in the states? And convince my dad to let me stay?",relationship_advice
t3_chg2xr,I (18M) just found out my (70+M) Grandpa sexually abused two of my uncles when they were younger,"I shouldent know this, but apparently my grandpa who has been my sole male rolemodel sexually abused two of my uncles when they were younger. I found this out just minutes ago by snooping thru my moms phone and finding text messages between my mom and one of the uncles. I dont know to what extent he abused but I know that my mom and grandma apparently knew all along during it. I dont know if I should just try to let this go but it changed how I look at my close family. I feel sick in my stomach just knowing this and thinking about the pain my uncle has had to gone thru.

My uncle has been an alchoholic thru most of my upbringing but he has always been one of the best and kindest people I have ever met.

I dont know if I should tell anyone that I know or how I should tell anyone I know.

t3_chabop,How do i go about this?,"I don't need judgement , criticism  and everybody telling me that I need to dump this douchebag . I already know this. I have never in my life been in a situation like this and I never would have put up with the b******* that I put up with out of him from anybody in the past. He's got a strong hold on me and he's doing everything that he can to keep me from exitimg his life. I've already confronted him. I told him I know everything. I also told him that I can blow his ass out of the water if I want to. With that being said, please be kind and considerate with your comments.

A month ago I found out that the man I've been seeing is in a relationship with another woman. A new relationship. Yes this devastated me and broke my heart. He has talked to me more since he entered into this relationship with someone else than he had talked to me in the two months prior to entering into this relationship with the other woman. We have been intimate three times in the past two weeks. I know  this is not a healthy situation for me stay in. I fell in love with him. I know  that I have to break things off  for my own self-preservation, emotional and mental health. I don't know when I'm going to be able to completely do this. Apparently, this other woman has been questioning his reliability, accountability, and trustworthiness. She posted a video this morning, a public video, letting everybody know that he was meeting all of her needs and that she was very happy and there was no need for anybody else to further question their relationship. I could see the hurt and pain in her eyes. She looked as if she had been crying prior. Her body language, tone of voice and forced smiles told all that her lips were not. I know that I need to let her know what's been going on ... At least I think that's what I need to do. Believe it or not, I don't want to hurt her anymore than she already is. However, I know that if she stays with him she's going to hurt even more in the long run. I know how much this is hurting me; How much he has hurt me in the past. I'm having a really hard time extricating him from my life, but I know that I have to. 

I really don't know how to go about this. I have never been in this situation before. I also know that I can very well end up looking like the scorned woman. Therefore, I feel that I need to keep it short and simple. I have considered having my best friend contact her under the pretense that I know nothing about her interference and thatat she is doing it because she doesn't want to see another woman hurt the way I have been hurt.",relationship_advice

t3_chd5r5,I [22M] desperately want to bail as groomsmen for friend's [22M] upcoming wedding because of money,"To set the scene, a college friend just asked me to be a groomsmen in his upcoming wedding (in winter).

&amp;#x200B;

Some background about myself - I am a new medical student balling on a new budget trying to save money (aka I'm broke af on student loans yo). I am also recently married and my wife doesn't make that much (less than a new teacher makes probably). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my friend that's getting married recently moved to a city in the NorthWest United States, which is very far from where we went to college and our hometowns (Texas yeehaw). He expects all of the groomsmen to make it and fly up there for a Friday &amp; Saturday. Flights are already at least $300 round trip for one person (not including my wife who is also invited and won't be coming). He also is booking us an Airbnb for the weekend and essentially forcing us to pay to stay there for another $100 or so (which isn't bad for lodging, but it adds to total cost). He hasn't mentioned suit rentals yet, but that is another expected expense easily ranging $100-200. On top of all of this there are still food expenses, potential Ubers or transportation, and unexpected costs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, for one weekend my friend expects me to drop half a thousand dollars (or more) to go to this wedding, and I don't know how it's feasible. He is very sensitive and would certainly be offended if I don't go. I love him, and I wish it wasn't a problem for me to go but I'm broke at this point in my life and can't really afford going long distances like this for one event. I would love advice on how I might navigate this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I suck it up and drop the money? Should he be more understanding of my circumstance? Am I overthinking this or being reasonable with money? Am I a jerk? Is this normal for ""destination-like"" weddings? Idk. I need advice.

t3_cha86p,OK SERIOUS QUESTION GUYS!! To what extent the friendship of your guy and his girl bestfriend one should accept?,"I'm 21f and he's 21m. Though it hasn't been long time since we've been talking and liking each other but we have shared how we like each other and have been close since then. We're now comfortable enough to share most of the things. 

So one day he tells me that he has a girl bestie and how cool she is. They talk alot and are pretty close. They're friends from 2 years. So I understood that he is obviously close to her.
But recently he told me how they celebrated their ""friendship anniversary"" out of nowhere in our conversation. Which I was fine with untill he tells me how he bonded so much with her and that they share lot of things with each other. He should've noticed that I wasn't comfortable at this point. But I didn't reacted ( again tried to be COOL but i wasn't :/ ) He didn't stopped he went on to tell me, ""YOU HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO"" in comparison to his bonding with her I guess.  He might've said jokingly but this didnt go down well with me and gave up trying to be ""COOL"" anymore.

Guys plz share your opinion on this. How much of  friendships with other person one should accept in a relationship? Was I overthinking and not cool enough to think that way? Was he doing this on purpose to make me feel jealous because I think he should've clearly seen how I didnt liked it? Plzzz reply thankyou!",relationship_advice
t3_ch35xh,Literally just found out my (20F) boyfriend (20M) has been cheating on me,"I’ve done absolutely everything for this man for the last 2 years. Stuck by him throughout all his bs, let him stay at my apartment for free for almost a full year until I eventually got him a nice job working for my dad, which eventually allowed him to finally get his own apartment a couple weeks ago. 

He hasn’t even been at his new place for a full week yet and he’s already inviting other girls over. I let him borrow my car this week (horrible decision) because I’m out of town the entire week, and he’s literally bragging to girls that he got a new car and new crib. My car. The crib I helped him get. 

I know this because I knew something was up (he was being weird and accusing me of things that were completely false) so I logged into his instagram to check his dms, wrong I know but it also confirmed my suspicions. 

Obviously I’m leaving this boy forever, but the problem: he has my car this entire week, and is watching my cats for the rest of the week. I don’t want him driving my car whatsoever at this point and there’s not much I can do about the cats until I get home on Sunday. If I report my car as stolen will he get in trouble for driving it? I’d give him a heads up before reporting it, just so he had fair warning to not drive it anywhere, but he’s the dumb kind of guy that still would. 

I feel like an idiot right now and it ruined the rest of my vacation. The only reason he hasn’t been cheating on me sooner is because he was staying at my place before this and obviously couldn’t invite girls over. I’m devastated

TL;RD my boyfriend is a piece of shit and I just found out while I started a week long vacation

Edit: My parents and entire family is on vacation with me, otherwise I’d definitely be sending my momma over to get my brand new car and cats back from him

Edit 2: Thanks for providing rational advice when I was all over the place with my emotions! He apparently agreed to use his friend/roommate’s car to get to work (they live and work together) and I also reached out to the friend privately to set up a backup plan in case the ex tries to do some shit with my cats. The friend is a really reasonable guy and only living there to save money on rent. So I guess that’s the best I can do for now",relationship_advice
t3_chd2ek,I (18m) am incredibly stressed out about breaking up with my gf (18f) for college,"It seems like every honest authority figure in my life right now is telling me to break up with her. I am listening and understand them, but I still love her. 
After talking to older friends that had tried a long distance and had felt so relieved and had less stress afterwords, I'm conflicted. 
I wanted to try and make a long distance work, hell I've dated her 3 years but I don't wanna be a burden on either of our college experiences. 
We are hours away from each other so the only time we'd see each other would be on school breaks. 
We have had a few major arguments but we've never split before and have always talked through any problems we've had. 
I kinda have 2 thoughts in my head right now. 
Do I, 1: break up with her before school starts so both of us go fresh, or 2: try long distance and and see what happens and decide for Thanksgiving break. 
I feel guilty about these thoughts because I really care about her and how she feels. I don't wanna hurt her. I dont wanna ruin her move in or her holiday or whatever. I don't wanna make her sad I'm just really conflicted. If I wait for thanksgiving break we have our 4 year anniversary.

t3_chfwys,I [F23] need help in deciding whether to continue investing in my relationship with a good guy [M26],"Tldr; M and I have a good physical and mental relationship, lacking a strong emotional connection. Need advice on how to either make that happen or decide when it's not working out.This guy, M, and I have been dating for close to 9 months now (East Coast, USA).  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm reaching that point in the relationship where I need to evaluate where this is going and if it's worth investing all of myself further. I would love to have someone as a sounding board, so here I am, on Reddit! I would appreciate people's comments and stories on their journeys in the dating/relationship world and maybe my reflections can benefit you. Without further ado, here is my story.  

&amp;#x200B;

M and I have pretty great chemistry; physical and mental. We have some similar interests and some different, which enriches our experiences, I believe, because we get to learn things about our different hobbies that we probably wouldn't have encountered before. I love to listen to him rant on about his favorite things and he reciprocates similarly. On a mental level, we stimulate each other, discuss our research experiences, send each other dank memes, and generally can have a conversation on random things for ages. On a physical level, we get along quite well. I have never been more satisfied in that aspect. Plus, I do not need to fake orgasms. This is a huge thing as in my previous relationship, my ex-partner would get very annoyed and irritated and take it out on me if he was not able to make me climax. He viewed it as a failing of his and that got him into a sour mood. That was a toxic relationship, anyway, for a variety of reasons. Basically, I had never known that I could orgasm this regularly. And the one time I could not, M did not see it as a big deal and we just cuddled instead!  

&amp;#x200B;

But here's where I have my doubts. I don't think we have as much of an emotional connection. Early on in the relationship, I felt like it was extremely one-sided. He tended to be cold and unapproachable at times. I brought up my concerns with him several times over a couple of months. We talked about it and he said that his upbringing (religious, homeschooled till high school) caused him to be more reserved and unmoving to strong emotions but that he did care about me very much. We were still testing the waters then and had decided that if it turned serious naturally, it would. I think over the past few months it has gotten better and he is way more affectionate than before. However, I still feel like I am not heard at times and my emotional needs aren't met. I was seriously depressed before I met him and it was through a lot of therapy and work on my part that I was able to regain my life. I have shared this with him but I didn't get the feeling that he understood how much it impacted me. The first time I decided to open up about this, which was quite difficult, he mistook that as a 'we're sharing things we haven't told each other yet' moment and told me about a girl he had met at a conference, with whom nothing happened (they had lunch together, which is common. I make a lot of friends and connections through conferences), but it was still so early on in our relationship that he felt weird about it, given the potential of it being more. We talked through the night about that but afterward, I just felt like I had shared the most personal and traumatizing thing about myself and had been completely ignored. Like he asked no questions or offered no sympathy or even no 'I'm glad you're doing better now'. I've since then talked a little bit more about it, in bits and pieces. There was one instance recently where I was feeling downright miserable and decided to brave telling him about it. He was sweet and came over to give me company. But the common feeling in this and other things has been that it's always my job to open up and when I do, I don't feel fully heard or that he wants me to share and wants to know more about me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the relationship, it feels like I have been doing most of the emotional work. Especially when it comes to communicating about the relationship, making sure we're on the same page, communicating concerns. While we have a lot of fun, we attend social events together, do fun things together, are open to trying out new things, I feel a lack of a serious emotional connection. How does one establish that? How do I know that he cares and wants to learn more about me? I don't want him to be my therapist but as my boyfriend, I think I should be able to talk to him openly. I don't want to continue this relationship if this is all it's ever going to be. It seems more casual than anything else. And we established long ago that it was a serious one. I tried bringing this issue up once but all he said was that emotional connections require time. I agree, but I think they also require effort, something that I do not see coming from him a whole lot.  

&amp;#x200B;

So Reddit, how do I bridge this gap? At what point in your relationships did you feel an emotional connection?",relationship_advice
t3_cgzry4,Looks like they might be getting what they deserve,"On a night out, I got a little too close with a work colleague. Another colleague - married with x4 kids - hated this, as he was trying to start something with her, but she claimed she didn't like him. She's 23, he's 40, I'm 28. 

She told me she had ended it with her boyfriend - she hadn't. She goes back to him properly as she was living with her mother, and after months of him harassing me and other colleagues, they split up. 

The married colleague still hates me, and has been causing hell for me. Accusing me of stuff to my managers, taking things from my desk - though we couldn't prove it was him. 

One day I noticed stuff was missing, told my managers. They checked CCTV footage and found that the two of them have been accessing the office without permission to have sex - they have nowhere else to go as he has a wife and she lives with her parents.

They'll be fired in a week, neither know management know about the CCTV footage - I do because I've been involved in the investigation, since it's been my things being taken. 

Her ex is messaging me asking what's going on with me and her. I keep telling him nothing, and she's been messaging me telling me not to message him, or to talk about her ""best friend"" who is the married guy. 

I have a week to get through this shit. What do I do now, just ride it out? Should I mention the married guy to the ex later down the line?

t3_chd0gh,"I didn't expect this kind of an ending with my ex. [M22, F26]","We were so very close for the past two years, and I know our relationship had meaning but in the back of my mind after being rejected by this girl so many times in different ways I always felt like I couldn't compare to the boyfriend she loved before me who cheated on her. I sucked at communicating alot. I was immature at times. I wasn't needy or the jealous type, and she was free to do what she wanted outside the relationship. I thought I was a really good boyfriend after all, considering her parents and the rest of her family loved me so deeply. I was practically living with her and her family. A whole separate universe an hour away from me. I tried so very hard to make it work and there were times where I felt like she wasn't trying and could feel her wanting to give up---for whatever reason. She was so very attached to me, and at times I did take that for granted but at the end of the day I loved her. I wasn't sure where it would go, but I just knew we would remain that inseparable forever (in my mind, I guess). We were best friends and shared so many deep intimate memories. When my hardest college semester (Paramedic school) reared it's ugly head was when we had problems. She was bothered that I couldn't admit I had time for her. We had fights. She broke up with me for a very short time and came back crying. She always came back. Then, a month later in the midst of my finals--she decided to end it again with no chance of return.   


Within two weeks, I found myself blocked on all social media (even though I went NC and removed her off everything first) and that's when a friend broke the news to me that she had found someone else. This guy is totally her type. Plays in a band, likely her age, and is probably more confident than I was in himself. She's done nothing but post about him. He posted that they were officially getting married and that she is his ""soulmate"" and they will be together for eternity. She's still with him and it's been two months, with 60 days of NC from me. How could it end so abruptly? She seems to love him more than she ever loved me with the way she had been posting on social media. Last time I checked was July 4th. She keeps saying how in love she is and how happy everything is going for her in her life. Why was is to easy to forget me and it took her so long to get over her last boyfriend? None of this adds up and it hurts so, so bad. Of course I want her back. I still have the hope that I just can't kill that I'll hear from her again.

t3_cgxp8q,I (21F) found my boyfriend (22M) alone with a girl I hate (23F),"My boyfriend and I go to the same college. We started our bachelor in the same semester and will graduate together. 

We've been together for only 6 months, but everything was good until now.

A few months ago during a college event, we met a girl named Carmen. Even knowing that he was not single, Carmen flirted with my boyfriend throughout all the week-long event. 

After this event, I made it clear to my boyfriend that I didn't like the way Carmen was flirting with him all the time and that I wanted us to avoid her from now on. He thought it was funny that I was bothered, but he agreed. 

This morning I was in college and was feeling a little sick and wanting to throw up. So I went to a bathroom that few people know so I could be alone. This bathroom is near a terrace with a beautiful view. 
I had just finished throwing up and was washing my mouth when I hear familiar laughter outside the bathroom. I finish washing my mouth and leave. 
Outside were my boyfriend and Carmen, looking at the view and laughing together. They were surprised to see me there. What were the chances of me being there when they arrived? I started walking to the exit and my boyfriend asked me where I was going. I lied, said I had to pick up my sister from school and left. 

I haven't talked to him about it yet. I don't even know where to start and honestly, I'm ashamed to be jealous.

What do I do? I can't imagine a situation where he would take her there without any ulterior motives.

Why the hell would he take her to see the view from the terrace? Is it worth it to ask?

EDIT: There's no other reason to go near that area except to go to the bathroom or visit the terrace.",relationship_advice
t3_chcz34,At the end of my rope and don't know what to do anymore. Should I [21 F] break up with my boyfriend [24 M] or stay and hope things get better?,"This is going to be a long one but please, please bear with me and stick it out to the end. It's literally a soap opera so hopefully not too bad of a read either :( There's a **TLDR** at the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years now and been through so much during this time. He was my first everything and I fell hard for him. But there were a lot of issues early on, especially with him not really understanding how consent worked as I was his first girlfriend. Things got so bad in that department that I ended up missing a midterm after having a breakdown. But we worked through it, I trusted that things would eventually get better and they sort of did, though the feeling of being a little nervous when it came to having sex with him never went away. On top of that, he was very very into the idea of talking about marriage and kids constantly and around the year point I felt like I was suffocating in a very serious relationship that I was not mentally prepared for.

So I asked for a breakup with the possibility of coming back, during which we could both see other people. In my mind, I thought that this would give me the chance to have other romantic relationships before deciding if I was in a place where I could commit. The idea of only being in one relationship since my bf was my first everything scared me and I also didn't want sex riddled with issues on consent to be my ONLY experience with sex for the rest of my life.

He agreed to the break and we decided to see how things went. I asked a coworker to go to a party with me, intending for it to be a hookup (no sex occurred though), and a couple of days later he made it clear that he wanted a relationship. I (being young, stupid, and not wanting to hurt this guy's feelings) didn't know how to tell him 'no' so I agreed provided he agreed that this would NOT turn into a serious relationship. Also because we worked together I was worried rejecting him would cause problems at work. Anyway, I figured I liked him enough to give dating him a try, so we started dating.

The next month goes by and my ex wants me to break up with the coworker if we're getting back together. By this point, I really missed him, realized I didn't particularly want to date the coworker because we weren't super compatible. The coworker was going through a really rough time with school and stress and after a failed breakup attempt where I wasn't clear enough, I realize that breaking up with him again when he's in such a bad state would make me feel so guilty and awful. So I tell my ex to move on but he chooses to wait, hoping I'll eventually end it with the coworker. I told him to not wait for me because I didn't want him to resent me for this later, but he was adamant about it.

So another month goes by, I try to support the coworker through all of it and be there for him to the best of my abilities. There's still no sex going on because he basically couldn't ever either get hard or maintain an erection and also because the idea of having sex with someone i'm not used turned out to be a massive trigger for me. All of the consent related issued from my last relationship that I had repressed into oblivion finally came back up because of this new relationship and send me into a massive depressive spiral that culminated in a suicide attempt.

My ex was there for all of it - supporting me through it all, getting me through the depression and severe anorexia relapse that ensued post suicide attempt. And he single handedly got me through it, put up with me breaking down for months and months on end, never complained and was always my rock even when I took him for granted. December swings around, coworker and I still haven't had sex (which was a big part in my ex being ok with this fucked up situation) until one night he and i got very drunk and he started talking about how he felt like such a loser because he couldn't have sex with me. This went on for about an hour until I felt so bad for him that I gave in. Sex was absolutely terrible, lasted ACTUALLY 2 seconds but my ex felt betrayed. I realized I didn't want to do this anymore - be trapped in a relationship I absolutely didn't like because I didn't know how to reject the guy without hurting his feelings. So I manned up and broke up with him. Except he didn't...let me? Cried for 4 hours, told me he loved me, wanted to marry me, etc then when I said I was getting overwhelmed by how much his reaction was (given that it had been THREE MONTHS) he physically prevented me from leaving so I was trapped in his apartment, then initiated sex, then asked if I didn't mind getting HIM off, then finally backed off after I was close to tears. He threatened to make work miserable for me, tell all of his friends I was a terrible person (we share friends and our department is like...4 people big so gossip spreads fast) just said a bunch of terrible things that made me feel even more trapped than before. So he agreed to space to see how things went.

After winter break ended, things hit the fan again. He was constantly breaking down, worried, stressed, but this time his stress was about ME and the relationship. The final nail in the coffin was him getting angry at me for canceling a date because I had a huge problem set to do. I firmly and clearly say I want to break up, consequences be damned. He goes off the rails, quits work so that all of his projects get dumped onto me on top of an insanely busy semester, and just screams hatred at me over messenger. The next couple of days go by and I feel so bad for hurting him and terrified of what work will be like, so out of fear and also so much guilt because I genuinely cared about him as a person, I get back together with him, telling my ex I 100% don't want him to wait for me anymore because it's not fair to him.

This sends my ex into a huge huge depressive spiral and he spends the next two months just verbally and emotionally abusing me to the point where I contemplate suicide several times because I can't take the abuse. I try my best to be strong for him and get him through it but because of how bad these blow ups are, I run to my coworker for reaffirmation that the things my ex are saying just aren't true. We get a lot closer as he helps me deal with all of this and as I started falling harder for him, more regular sex followed, all of which I don't disclose to my ex for fear of him going back into his depressive cycle. I realized that I loved my coworker as a very very good friend, just wasn't in love with him. But any time I mentioned a hypothetical breakup he made it clear to me that I was either his girlfriend or I would be blocked on everything and be nothing to him.

May hits and I realize I'm pregnant. Coworker and I decide to get an abortion which was incredibly traumatic and the most painful thing that I've gone through. I spiral into a massive bout of depression afterwords and all the while, my ex went back to his verbal abuse which on top of the guilt and regret from the abortion was way way too much to handle. So the coworker and I go on a vacation we had planned and at this point, which was the longest amount of consecutive time we had spent together...which made me notice a lot of things about him and his personality that all culminated in me not being attracted to him at all. The first night, he noticed that I wasn't holding his hand or kissing him and confronted me about it, I tried to give a bunch of excuses but he forced me to kiss him, then initiated sex to which i said no. I gave him every excuse I could think of - we have to wake up early, it's late, i'm tired, i don't really want to, etc. to which he said ""Look I'll be really quick and then you can sleep"" and dodged every excuse until I gave up. After this i felt so hopelessly gross and awful and used that I couldn't take it anymore. I broke up with him the next day. Two days later he found texts to my ex saying  I couldn't wait to go back to him. It ended badly with him calling me worthless, a whore, 50 other wonderful names, he left me with bruises all over my body and I ended up flying home, blocked on everything with the situation finally over.

I thought this meant the verbal abuse would finally stop, but it hasn't. The things my ex \[now bf since we were finally free of this stupid situation\] says are so awful and have left me massively depressed and suicidal. I know how rough this situation was for him, but I wished he had just moved on instead of waiting and lashing out at me in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** After a weird 10 months of being broken up with my bf who waited for me while I felt trapped in a relationship w/ a coworker, he became verbally abusive and after three suicide attempts, traumatic sexual assault memories coming back up, severe depression + self harm + anorexia relapses, a pregnancy + subsequent abortion, months of verbal abuse, being physically assaulted by my piece of trash coworker, and more verbal abuse i'm beyond my breaking point. I know how awful this has been on him but i can't take it anymore and i'm not in love with the abusive person he's become, though I see that he's *trying* to go back to the person he was before all of this. I don't know how or if either of us can truly get past what's happened and repair the relationship or if we should break up. I don't know if therapy, space, taking time apart so both of us can deal with the things we've both been through will help. Please. Help.",relationship_advice
t3_chcy4b,My girlfriend has joked several times that she hopes I pay for more stuff once I get promoted,"Been with my GF for a little over a year. I am nearing a promotion at my job soon, and will likely get a good raise. Lately, my girlfriend has joked several times, saying stuff like ""Hope ya do well on your yearly review, that way you can take me out more!"" or ""Ooh you're getting promoted soon? Does that mean you'll take me out to nicer places?""

Currently we make around the same amount of money (with me making a negligible amount more), and we generally split roughly equally. But overall I'm the kind of guy who likes to split costs on most things in a relationship, although I don't mind treating her every so often. She has always been pretty chill with splitting things, but recently she has been expecting me to pay for more things, such as transportation and stuff like that. I've called her out on it before, and she says something like ""I don't expect you to pay for everything, but it'd be nice if you pay for some stuff"".

I've  been dating this cute girl for 6 months, we are not officially boyfriends, but we consider this as a relationship, we both accepted to be loyal and respect our relationship while we still get to know each other, well, since May she has been hanging out with this ”friend”, let's call him Jo. Jo obviously has other intentions, He likes her, I know that, she knows that, she accepted this. I confronted her in multiple times because I felt sad and jealous, I never forbade her to see him, but she always got mad when I asked why she goes out with him even knowing that he likes her, and her responses were ” I don't have to give explanations to anybody because I'm not doing anything wrong  ”, she made me feel like an intolerable jealous guy, even when I think I have a reason to be jealous, well this Thursday and Friday she did the same, but something changed, she started to act indifferent with me, no more signs of love, and yesterday, she texted me that she won't be able to see me again because she will have new work schedule from 1 to 9 p.m., and Sundays free. She told me that on Sundays she will be with her family and won't have time. I told her that I was willing to see her even if only were 2 hours a week, she said that she didn't want that for me, but the interesting thing is that we had had dates multiple times on Sundays and even with her family,  also she upload photos to her Instagram from this Friday with Jo, she looks happy and even she's hugging him a bit, she didn't want to explain again because ”she’s not doing anything wrong ”, but also came with this reason of the work schedule. I always told her that when she goes out with Jo made me feel bad and she didn't care too much because continued doing it. I feel like this new work schedule it's a pathetic reason to abandon me, also I feel like she's really hiding something with Jo, he even comment with love emojis in her Facebook and Instagram photos/states, also she never uploaded a photo with me before, why does Jo doesn't know anything about me and my ”relation” with her?

t3_chcxe8,How do I confront my father’s alcoholism?,"On mobile.

My(M27) dad (M51) is awesome. He is a hard working, caring, kind, and an all around respectable person. He worked his ass off to provide a great life for my mother, sister, and I. He did this despite having a rougher childhood. He comes from a long line of emotionally abusive people and he had to claw his way out. I love him immensely and I am proud to be his son.

My father has always been the type of guy to have a couple of beers after work. It was never a big deal. He still functioned at a level that was alien to most people. He works his ass off. About 10 years ago, after a particularly rough patch for the family (multiple deaths, divorces, and bad friends,) Dad’s 2 beers after work turned to 4... then 8 and so on. Since, my sister and I have both moved out, his couple beers after work has turned into a 12-18 pack each night.

My mother (F51) is a saint. She is level headed and tough but avoids confrontation. Dad would come in the house from his shop every night, and drunkenly make some nachos in the microwave or some other snack. After eating he would promptly head to bed around 10:00. No matter how much he drank, he would always wake up first thing in the morning and go work. Looking back, he might have been the textbook definition of ‘functional alcoholic.’ My mother let the drinking slide. After all, he was never emotionally or physically abusive (in fact, he was still kind and pleasant) and he always woke up and continued to be a model father/husband. No harm, no foul.

My dad is gifted mechanically and generous. So much so, that he regularly helps friends and neighbors with their projects. Since we (his kids) left, he has occupied more and of his free time with these projects. Being around company and working on something has further enabled his drinking. However, he regularly gets trashed on his own. My sister (F21) has become more vocal about the issue. While she does not fear confrontation, she is unable to do it calmly. There is inevitably an eruption of yelling and anger that solves nothing.

Last week, I called my dad just to say hello and catch up. I was surprised to find out that he was in a serious auto accident (no other cars involved) the day before. No one called me... Thankfully, he wasn’t hurt. His truck was completely totaled. 

Yesterday, I found out that he lied to me about most of the story. The truth was, he was *drunk driving*, in a *company vehicle* with a *passenger.* The potential implications of that decision are staggering to say the least!

After the accident, he called an officer that he knew personally (which is probably why he wasn’t sobriety tested.) He then called my mother and sister to let them know what happened. He was obviously drunk by the way he sounded on the phone. I also confirmed that he had been drinking by others that were with him that night before he left.

I am furious. I am furious with my father for doing something so incredibly stupid and lying to me about it. I am especially angry with myself for my lack of action. I have pushed the concerns of my sister and mother about my father’s habits away for too long. I now understand, that my dismissal has allowed this sickness to spread. While, at the end of the day, his health remains *his* responsibility, I would never be able to live with myself if I lost my dad to alcoholism without ever trying to help.

I’m going to take a few days to cool off. I know, that I can’t approach this with anger. He is a stubborn, gruff, old school, southern, country boy. He is also a fucking amazing person that has fallen into alcoholism.

t3_chfsc8,Should you tell someone you barely know that their husband is fucking prostitutes?,"well, yes, of course, but how?

I really like the wife, and even if I didn’t, she deserves much more than a husband who has unprotected sex with a 20 year old heroin shooting prostitute. Regularly. Well now the hoe is trying to extort him saying she is pregnant with his child and he’s going to begin a lifetime of payments to her to save his family from finding out. Not even interested in waiting for paternity, but of course it isn’t his, so what’s the difference. Ok guys, what do I do? I would be betraying confidences to tell this to the wife, I was “hired” by the mother of the asshole to look into this hoe, and I don’t think many other people know about it. I should tell her right? I know this post is all over the place, and I am no protector of POS men like this, but I will say that my big concern is their family. Their daughter is 13 and trans and has been having a really hard time dealing with it, her parents love and support her but our community is very repulsively oppressively Christian and I worry about her losing her family, worry about that a lot.

He said he wanted to remain friends and said he’d like to get to know me more.  Acted like it didn’t happen afterwards.

 Thing is, he’s never initiated conversation (which I should’ve picked up as a red flag). I asked him to hang out with a group of friends and he declined.  About a month later, I asked if he wanted to catch up when I got back from vacation and he said he wanted to.  So when I got back, talked to him for a bit then asked him to meet up for drinks and to pick a day that’s good for him. 

He then said his “life just got crazy” and got super busy with work (he’s in the music industry).  Didn’t even suggest when he’d possibly be available, I took that as a hint he wasn’t interested in me to begin with despite me trying to develop a friendship.  So I told him what I wrote on the title of this post and wished him luck, and he just said thanks.  Am I an asshole for saying that?

t3_chb3wa,Gas-lighting? Or just speaking different languages...,"My husband and I have been married for 16 years - the first 12.5 were awesome, but then suddenly it became awful pretty much overnight and it's been a rollercoaster ever since then, and for the past 2 months he has been sleeping at the office during the week and coming home on the weekends in an attempt to give us both space to heal while limiting our opportunities to fight. We've been trying to make sure that we go on a date every weekend to try and build some good experiences together, although that has lapsed the last few weeks because he's gone on a couple of vacations. I could go into a LOOOOOTTTTT of detail about this awful rollercoaster we've been on the past 3.5yrs, but I'm trying to be brief. 
Basically, the reason I'm here is because we had a big fight last weekend and he was so absolutely positive that everybody in the world would agree with him that he hopped onto Reddit to ask, right then and there. He had responded to an email from me basically telling me that he knows he's not perfect and he could be doing some things better, but ""some people"" close to us have suggested that maybe I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and he included a link with information, and then sent another link to an article about helping somebody with BPD and said that these were some things he could do to help me. To be clear, I am 99% certain that I do not have BPD, but, both in a text and face-to-face, I told him that I would be willing to be professionally evaluated if he would too, because if either one of us is dealing with some kind of disorder or condition that makes it difficult to see things clearly, we need to know about it so that we can deal with it. I also told him that until that happens, he needs to assume that there is nothing wrong with me because I can't stand having all my thoughts and feelings completely invalidated and dismissed. He was resistant to that idea, but the thing that he absolutely REFUSED to do, and the thing that ultimately led to him packing up and leaving before the weekend was over, was admit that by sending me that email he was suggesting that he thinks I have BPD. It was infuriating and mind-boggling for me because he had already admitted that he thinks I have it, but he point blank refused to admit that his email was him telling me he thought I had it, because he used the words ""they think"" not ""I think"". 
Anyway. I did manage to find his Reddit - only two people have replied but thankfully both of them basically told him he had handled it horribly, even though he spun it as hard as he could in his back-story. For 3.5 years he has been hurting me (not physically, not even close!) but for 3.5 years I have believed that it has been unintentional, but sometimes I wonder whether he is just so set on believing that he is 100% right that he only hears ""crazy"" when I talk.",relationship_advice

We go to college together and she only lives like 2 or 3 cities next to where I live so I visit her over the summer at least once a month or whenever I'm available since I work and I don't have a mode of transportation. She has depression and anxiety so there are times where she pushes me away and get into fights because either her anxieties or my worries are getting the better of us. I always try to understand her and be there for her at those times and she'll also try to be there for me when I'm in need of emotional support.

Last week, she almost broke up with me saying that she just doesn't want to be in a relationship anymore because she wanted to focus more on herself, she doesn't see us together in the future and she doesn't feel the same love we had before. I figured that it was because of the slight ldr we have atm I totally understand that she wants to improve her life and if being without me helps that, then I'll be glad to do so even if it ducking hurts me to so. I myself has been too clingy and needy now that I think about it. I was about to let go and asked her if being friends would be an option but she stopped and told me that she just wanted to have space and didn't want to break up yet...

t3_chfm6u,"Don’t Know If My Dad Loves Me, Or If He Is Considered Abusive"," I’m coming to you good people for your outlook or if you see what I see. It’s hard to talk about so thank you

All of my life, I have always felt abused by my father. He is manipulating, patronizing, belittling, and highly aggressive. As long as I can remember, just the sound of his voice and feeling his presence gives me extreme anxiety. When you live with someone who does this to you every time you’re around, it takes a very serious toll on your day to day functions I’m sure you can understand. But I just don’t know whether or not to call him abusive in the current definition of “abusive”. Let me give you more info

I grew up with a very bad learning disorder, ADHD, with a very severe hyperactive symptom. Now i go to therapy for it, but during my child hood it made life unbearable. My older brother was the star child and I was the classic misfit. My fathers ego did not allow him to accept having a child with a disorder so I was subject to exclusion from the family’s love and aggressive mental abuse. I had no idea at the time. I thought it was just the way life goes, kinda like Darwinism. But now that I’m much older, I CANNOT let this go as nothing. Im finding out that living like that was not normal for a child. I would cry myself to sleep every night, praying that I wouldn’t have to go to school the next day. I was suicidal by the age of 9 before i had any idea that suicide was actually a thing people do. He would smack me around and yell at me about how I’m not as good as my brother during homework. He would tease me so bad about how different I was (I didn’t get along with any of the kids and was basically an alien). It didn’t help that I was additionally bullied everyday at school until 10th grade. 

At this point I am older and more successful so I have the option to live with what I know and come to a conclusion about my father. I just don’t know anymore. I know it’s a moral obligation to love your parents but I just don’t have that. I feel so betrayed and I still live my anxiety directly because of what he did to me in my adolescence. I want to forgive him, but I keep on remembering my 9 year old self laying in my bed sobbing because nobody loved me and my dad made me feel worthless. I don’t know if this amounts to “abuse” like I said. I would love to hear your thoughts 

He also gave me a lot of money to start my life when I turned 18 so it’s hard to say out loud that I don’t love him. But money isn’t everything right?

t3_chaz99,I Don't Think My Mom (44) Cares About Me (F18).,"To start this off, I just want to warn you that I have a lot to say, so it's going to be VERY long. I apologize in advance. 

**I'm not sure that this post needs one but just in case, I'll give a TW for emotional abuse. Also, please note that this post was previously posted on the r/advice subreddit. I decided after a bit that this was probably the better place for it and deleted my previous post.**

So basically, my issue here is my relationship with my mother. I was hoping someone could give me advice on how to improve it? 

To properly explain the situation though, I think some backstory is in order. 

• My mom didn't have an easy childhood. Her own mom was very emotionally abusive and she suffered from undiagnosed depression and anxiety for decades. Her father and grandmother (who were basically the only two people that really cared for her as a child) are now gone.

• My father (57), mother, sister (20), and myself have not had contact with my mom's family in almost 4 years. I was the one who promoted the whole cut off, because the toxic behavior from my mother's family was beginning to mess with my own. My aunts and grandmother would always question and belittle my older sister, and that is what really set me to ask my family to let them go; I don't care who you are, you don't screw with my sister (who has her own depression/anxiety issues aswell).

One of mother's uncles was also involved in spreading a nasty rumor about my father-- I won't go too in depth, but let's just say that it could've wrecked my family. These people are awful individuals, and I knew my dad, mom, and sister felt the same way; all it took was a discussion and we had all collectively decided to keep them out of our lives. 

• For the past two years or so, my mom has gone through therapists, counseling, and medications in order to try and accept what she's gone through with her mother. Although I have seen an improvement as far as how she acts and handles things, she's still a very bitter and petty person. If she has the chance, she will make a rude, snarky remark about her family. I understand it's not easy to make changes or accept things when they have gone on for so long, but it seems that she hasn't made ANY progress in trying to understand her pain.

• Growing up, my father was the one who worked while my mom stayed home with us. As a child, my mother would do the bare minimum that was required to care for me. She would feed me, clothe me, bathe me, and do pretty much what she had to do to make sure I was healthy. But at around age 5 or so, I began to notice that she never really spent time with me. All day she would be hanging out with my older sister while I was left by myself-- we were all in the same home, but I was left out. When it was time for my sister to attend school, my mom would plop me in front of the t.v or let me play in the backyard, but she NEVER tried to spend time with me unless it had to do with taking care of my necessities. 

There were very few exceptions to this. I can remeber one or two times where she would sit down and watch a movie with me, or maybe even take me out. But most days, I went ignored. Before you wonder, no she wasn't occupied with housework or anything like that. Our apartment was messy. Our mother hates cleaning, and even though I love her, I will be the very first person to tell you that she is lazy as all hell. She didn't clean at all and had no care that her children were growing up in such an unclean setting (and hell no, I didn't expect her to do housework because she's the mother/a woman, I expected it because she was the non-working parent who was always at home).

•  When I was in kindergarten, my dad got into a car accident, which put him out of work for around 3 years. My mom, instead of searching for a job, chose to stay home and try to continue living a life we couldn't afford. Ever since then we've been very behind financially.

--

Now that I've given you some background, I'll get to my actual issue. 

I feel like my mother doesn't care about me. 

I know she loves me and would be devastated if anything happened to me, but as an individual, a person with feelings, she just doesn't care. I'll outline the reasons here.

• She has no interest in me. I tell her so many things about my interests, hobbies, hopes, etc, and she never cares; it's the exact definition of ""in one ear, out the other"". The only time she bothers to remember something is when she can brag to someone else about it. I'll talk to her about my achievements and the first thing she does is say how much she brags about me at work (yes, she finally got a job a few years back after our finances basically forced her to). When I talk about a genuine interest or worry of mine though, she acts like she's never heard me talk about it before. It seems that she only puts effort into remembering things about me when she can get some kind of satisfaction out of it. 

• We still don't spend much time together. We're not close. 99% of the time, when I try to talk to her, she ignores me outright. It feels so humiliating to try and say something to someone, only to have them act like you don't exist. Not to mention that it hurts like hell. Anytime that we do actually spend together is awkward. It's silent a lot of the time, and if we're in public, she barely acknowledges that I'm there, aside from the weird, polite conversation from moment to moment; it's like she's walking through a world without me in it. I try to find ways to hang out/talk with her, but it never works out.

• She always has, and continues, to favor my sister. They're pretty much inseparable, and like I said earlier, it's always been this way. I used to chalk it up to how similar their personalities are, but now I just think it has something to do with me. When we were kids, if my sister and I fought, I was in the wrong and got punished. If my mom had something, it was offered to my sister, not me. They went out, watched t.v., had similar hovvies, and I remained ignored. Even my dad has noticed this and in the past has unsuccessfully asked my mom to spend more time with me. This used to be a huge issue for me as a kid and I detested my sister for a long time over it (my sister and I have gotten over this though, I know that it isn't her fault, she did nothing wrong, and we're very close now).

My biggest issue with their closeness now is that I feel like my mom takes advantage of my sister, who has serious codependency issues, ESPECIALLY with our mom. My mom knows this, yet still relies on the fact that my sister is dependent on her if it means getting what she wants-- this is a tremendous issue when it comes to the house (we moved to an actual home when I was 8, it's small, but better than an apt). My mom acts like my sister is a maid. She freely throws her garbage everywhere, doesn't take care of her dishes, and flat out almost never does her own laundry. In turn, my sister does all of that. I try to help her as much as I can, but the two of us are never enough. Our house is a mess an our mother is the main culprit behind it: she refuses to do anything around the house.

This is a huge issue given the # of pets we have: 1 dog, 4 cats. We basically have them only because my mom wanted them (I literally BEGGED her not to get our most recent cat, but as always, she ignored me). She doesn't feed them or walk the dog or clean the litter boxes-- that's all on my sister and I. Not to mention the SMELL that comes with the pets.

• My mom is one of the most selfish women I know. If she wants something, she has to have it, no matter what anyone else had to say about it. She doesn't care a lot the finances or what anyone else wants. In her mind, it's her first, always. There's so much splurge spending on food, DVDs, and other useless things all because she wants them and my dad can't say no to her. We're not wealthy. I've had to go without esstinal items and have missed out on plenty of social/academic opportunities because of this.

I remember vividly one time when we were talking about paying for my college, and if she would pay SOME of the tuition, or all of her loans (we can't afford either, this was a completely theoretical situation that we talked about). Her answer was that they'd pay off all her loans so she could have better credit and get either a new car or move. Now I wouldn't be pissed of I didn't work so hard in school (3.8 GPA, two 5's and two 4's on AP tests). At one point I said ""But I'm your kid. Shouldn't I come first?"". Her response was ""Do I look like I care?"".

• My mom is an awful parent. She's kind and a nice person, but she did nothing to parent us as kids. She didn't care what we ate (or if we ate), what time we went to bed, and when or if we did school work. If my sister and I needed an appt or anything, she would leave it up to our dad to take us and act like we're a burden if she ended up having to take us instead (which rarely happened). She wanted the title of a mother without the responsibilities. This lead to my older sister raising me. It was my sister who made me dinner. It was my sister who comforted me and worried when I was out too late. It was my sister who took charge and made me feel like someone was watching out for me. Our mother is insanely immature, and because if it, both my sister and I have paid the price. 

• The woman demands sympathy. If the attention isn't on her, the world has ended. She constantly has all these random issues/injuries that seem to come out if nowhere. These often lead to days missed from work or some kind of excuse not to do anything. This is a big problem, especially if I'm the one getting the attention. If there's an issue with me, no matter how serious she needs to have something too. If I'm sick, she's sick. I get hurt, she gets hurt. If I'm upset, she needs to have a breakdown. 

• She never cares to be involved. I've been doing theatre/choir for six years now, and she's been to maybe 4 concerts and 2 shows out of many. My dad and sister always make every single effort they can to be there, yet my mom always has some kind of excuse. Look, I'm not someone who needs attention or any of that to thrive, but it would be nice to have my own mother support me. 

In all, I feel like my mother doesn't care for me. I think that she's selfish, immature, and has little regard for me, my feelings, and my boundaries. I love her to death, and I always will, but at this point I'm beginning to resent her. These issues are only getting worse no matter how hard I try to address them with her and my family; even when I'm somewhat successful, I end up being the bad guy. 

I can't wait to get away from her and I feel so guilty about it, but I have no idea how else to feel. I don't want her to have this kind of emotional hold over me forever, but I don't want to be a stranger to her either. I just want there to be a way for us to be close. 

Is there anything I can do to help our relationship? Please, I love my mom and I don't want to look back one day when she's gone and know that I was always so distant-- if you have any advice, please tell me.",relationship_advice
t3_chfjca,Did I [24F] mess up my relationship with my bosses by asking them to keep a secret for me?,"It was pre-determined that I would leave this job at the end of the summer for school. The exact leaving date was not pre-determined. They wanted me to stay until August 31, but I have a medical procedure on August 20 that will take me 2 weeks to recover. I don't want anyone, my bosses included, to know what it is. So I told them exactly what I wrote here: I have a medical procedure on August 20 that will take me 2 weeks to recover. As a result, my last day should probably be August 16 or August 19.

As they are acquaintances with my family, I also asked them to not repeat this to my family as I do not want my family to know that I even have a medical procedure in August. I can tell my bosses are curious what it is and it's probably off-putting for them not to know, and off-putting to ask them to keep a secret. They tend to treat each other like family so it's a bit weird to throw a secret so blatantly at them like this. But I'm not sure how else to go about this. Does anyone have any suggestions? This is a working relationship I care about and would like to see grow. I would really appreciate any advice.

i thought she doesn;t has any feelings with me anymore,so i told her mother that we broke up,so she doesn't have to make me food again for extra lesson after school which she usualyl does.She ask me why did i broke up with her so i told her everything.She said this ""Im sure A still really loves you.when we go to singapore on holiday i promise i would take her to buy a gift for you,the plan got cancelled and she got all upset.when we finally able to do it,she search every corner of the mall just to find a gift that you might like. im sure she still loves you"" and then she proceed to tell me about her lil bro's who just entered critical state of Asperger Syndrome which mean he will need extra attention from family member.She is also responsible for replacing her father to provide for the whole big family later in the future so she has to be successfull and that's also why she is following a lot of afterschool lesson.

she also said ""i think A broke up with you because she is afraid you won't be happy with her,not because she doesn;t loves you anymore.She knew she won;t have time to go on a date with you,and she knew you don't like that. so in the mist of everything she decides to break up just to spare you the anger and dissapointment.""

i tried to talk to her during class trip 3 days ago (some kind of live in) but everytime she keeps evading me followed with a very noticeable glassy eyes.I WANT to help her,i want to tell heer that she is not alone in this and casting me out when she has problem like this is just wrong.i want to stick with her through this problem and maybe got back together when her brother's problem is solved if possible.i still loves her and im almost certain she still harbor the same feeling.

i just don't know how to help her.i can accompany her whenever she is alone.but i don't know if she will like that,she won't even talk to me during the class trip.and i don't want to keep adding more stressfull thought to her mind.

t3_chau0j,I (19m) am afraid to tell girlfriend (19f) that I want to wait another semester before I start college,"    This is a long one so please bear with me

For starters, my girlfriend and I have been together for over two years now but we've been living together for a little over a year.  She moved in to my parents house during the end of our senior year of high school after having complications with the her original living situation. Originally it was only temporary but things didn't fall into place quite like they should have so we both decided that she would just move into my place until we started college then she would move into the dorms.  At first we'd  planned on persuing a higher education immediately after highschool but pushed it back a year so we could save money and get our shit together before real life hit. Fast forward a year and she has her date set for moving into the dorms and my freshman orientation is next week but I'm having second thoughts about starting college this semester. Normally I'd give it a shot and if try my best but we both work at a company that fully pays for our college as long as we pass our classes with C's and above, If you get a D or F you have to pay in full for that class, which is something that is completely out of the question for me at this time. Right now I don't even have a car, my girlfriend and I work together and there are only a limited number of parking spaces available at my house, so it made sense that we just drive her car until she moves out then when she leaves I buy my own car. I want to wait until the spring semester start college. I'm just not ready for college right now, to be honest I'm struggling both financially and mentally. She's always kinda pushed me to go to college and I don't want to let her down, I don't want her to think I'm being a wuss and making excuses Because I don't want to go to college. I truly do but I'm just afraid that there's gonna be too much on my plate and that I'm literally gonna have the pay the price.

t3_chcjbx,I think my [29m] partner’s [25f] car is showing evidence that she isn’t telling me the truth.,"Long story short, I have asked for boundaries to be set over a certain friend of hers, and she agreed to it. 

Anyways, she has texted me from his phone before after a long argument so I have his number in my phone. So when we spend time together she often has me drive her car, and her phone is typically connected to it while driving. 

When I go through her call history, which can be done without her seeing, his number has shown up a few times, and even on different occasions. I have asked her why this is happening and if she’s talking to him and she always tells me that it isn’t accurate and I’m getting upset over nothing. I have even called her phone while in the car with her to show that it’s accurate. 

She has deleted his contact out of her phone and deleted all their messages. I believe she’s deleting his call history and text after receiving them. I have confronted her about this and she gets incredibly defensive and typically insults me to some degree.

Is it possible her car call history is inaccurate? Or am I just being overbearing?",relationship_advice

t3_chfbzp,"My (F, 21) boyfriend (M,27) has been acting very strange the past few months and I can’t figure out what’s going on?","So we’ve been together for about two years and have our ups and downs. We both have decided to move forward and start fresh. Well, I decided to move on and start fresh and not hang his mistakes over his head like I’ve done in the past. So about a month ago he let his female friend hold a lingerie party at his and his roommates house. He hid the fact that it was a lingerie party from some due to the fact that he knew I would freak out. Then he also went on a weekend trip with her friends and his friends. I had a complete freak out on him when I found out that it was that type of party. The day he got back we went to dinner and a movie to hash it out. We agreed that it wouldn’t happen again and nothing happened at the party. 

We usually talk everyday at least and about two weeks after our conversation, communication just faded away. I haven’t seen him in about a month now and I have spoke with him on the phone in about three weeks he says he can’t talk at work anymore. I’ve texted him and he responds but it’s just about how we aren’t the same. So I figured you know what , I should just leave. If he can’t make time for me or talk to me, I need to leave.

So I ended it through text since he never wants to call anyway. He texted me back that he isn’t seeing anyone else and that he’s just trying to figure his life out right now and I’m trying to find a reason to leave. He said he didn’t want to lose me and it will feel so weird not having me in his life. He said he couldn’t just delete me out his life and just move on because he loves me too much. He never thought this day would come and he doesn’t think he could handle it.

So I replied back how much I wanted us to work out and how I wanted us to make it. However, by his actions he doesn’t because he’s not taking the steps and time to do so. I told him how much I did for him and every time he needed me I was there . I said he would rather go out and party than spend time with the girl he claims he doesn’t want to lose.

Tonight would be 48 hours since I sent that message and he has not responded. 

Update: I only mentioned what I’ve done in the relationship and not him. If I seem “clingy and abusive”, I promise you it’s the total opposite. I was basically being used because he couldn’t afford to live on his own and his car broke down. I was driving 40 miles a day taking him to and from work while helping him with his financial situation. In the midst of this, he cheated on me with another woman and was entertaining other women through messages. This was a toxic relationship all around, I understand.

It seems he just likes to be around me again. He initiates contact now as much as I. He texts me mid morning asking to meet up at 5 today. We agree on the park we met up before. I ask if he wanted to grab some carry out. No.

So I get to the park. Same table as before. As I am walking I am watching him. He is sitting with his head down. Wringing his hands. As I approach he did not hear me. I walked behind him and gently touched his shoulders as I went by. He looked up with tears in his eyes. I sat next to him and asked what was the matter. He told me he had been to his therapist today. It was his second visit. He went last week for the first time. He paused took a deep breath and blurted out that the therapist told him to stop seeing me, at least for a while until they got a better handle on his situation.

Of coursed I am floored. As tears flowed I asked why. He repeated what he said. I said I get that what is the justification? Am I doing something wrong? Am I hurting you? He said ""God no you are not hurting me. I have been so happy these last few weeks. "" The therapist thinks there are too many conflicts in his mind right now. A bit of seperation is needed until they sort them out. I asked ""The therapist told you to stop seeing me or you have come up with on your own?"" No he was told.

All the way home I kept thinking of this sentrence. Well, as someone who is in therapy for years I do not remember my therapist telling me to do something like this. They may have lead me to the conclusion but never flat out told me. Usually options are given then each discussed. Pro and Con. Then I reach a decision. 

To say the least I am devastated. I called my therapist just now to ask to see them asap. The service tells me they are on vacastion this week but in an emergency there is a thereapist taking calls. I get the name and number. It is the same as the one he is seeing. I am a complete mess. I am having so much trouble typing this out, let alone trying to cope. I called my mom. She moved away after I got back on my feet. She has met a new guy after years of putting up with me. She wasn't answering. But I know she will call back. I called  his friend couple. Thry were trying to console him right now so I hung up. 

Everything has been so wonderful. Seeing him, getting to know each other again. Sharing our day. Meeting his friends. I had planned  a vacation in a couple weeks as a treat to myself, months and months ago with a travel club. Because I could finally afford it. I thought he was upset because it is just around the corner. That he would miss me. I have  FB page set up to post pictures. I don't why I even typed that out.

Has anyone had a therapist tell you to do something? Maybe it has been my treatment because of me and not a practice.

I know this is marriage but I also want to ask here since this also involves relationship in general. Backstory-- I posted on reddit 2 weeks ago how I wanted to leave my husband because I had enough. The day after I posted it, he read it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I have been married for over a year, together for 3 this September. We are our first long term relationships, first serious one. We are head over the heels in love with each other until 2 days ago. 2 weeks ago, I posted aka vented out on reddit how I have had enough with him. That day when I posted it, I was alone in the house, studying for my licensure exam again that I failed 2 months ago, stressing over not having enough money (working part time so I have time to study),  being depressed because I have no one to talk to. I came here in the country 3 years ago which means I have no immediate family and bestfriends here. My husband is basically my savior, my confidant here. Anyway, I felt so alone that I had no one to talk to and my husband was out and about spending his money from his full time job and money from parents--yes his parents still financially support him, for us. The post was about how I was so fed up of him being financially irresponsible, still having vices, and overall fed up with him. I was in the heat of the moment where I said those stuff about him that I wanted to leave him. When he saw it, I explained everything to him that I was just venting out. We were okay after like NOTHING HAPPENED until Monday morning that we were hugging and cuddling when I said to him if we can bring back the love like how we first met.. then he said something about it being impossible since I damaged him.

We talked, cried, talked, cried until yesterday. He said he was deeply hurt and betrayed that I thought about divorcing or leaving him ever since before. He was right that I already knew he had his cigarettes and weed addiction even before marrying him. He said this cannot be fixed anymore because the damage has been done and what is said has been said. He also mentioned that we lack communication which I also agreed, and wanted to just go separate ways. I told him I want to fix us and fight for us and how could he throw this marriage away? He asked for time to heal which I completely understand. He wants us to be civil first. But here's the thing, we still sleep on the same bed even though I told him I want to sleep on the couch. He said he's fine with me sleeping with him. Then we still have sex, intimate, intense, hot, I love you so much sex. But after that, the morning after, we just have civil talk, no cuddles, no silly moments, no I love you, no text on break from work, unlike before.

I know I was in the wrong for posting something her eon the internet instead of confronting him but am I also in the wrong for agreeing to still have sex with him? What if it's the only thing holding us together? What if if I don't sleep with him he will continue to be distant? I wanted to leave so bad just to leave the tension in the house and sleepover somewhere for some time but I am too broke to find a hotel, my aunties live 6 hours from me, my friends have their own lives already here and I do not want them to know about my situation.

t3_ch7scb,I have an ego issue and I really want to fix it — I get upset when my boyfriend does better than me in anything — how can I be better?,"Hi everyone.

The title says most of it but I wanted to give more details. 

Basically, throughout my entire relationship history, I’ve (18F) gotten quite upset  whenever my boyfriends do better than me at things. The exception being things that I’d obviously be worse at such as weight lifting since I’m female. I’d get upset about them getting better grades, being better at video games, being paid more, etc. Its really like  an automatic response, where if something like that happens I get automatically physically angry. Like I’ll actually get adrenaline and feel angry in those scenarios.

I just need some advice for how to not be like that. I sincerely want to be supportive and happy for them, but for some reason my automatic response is different. I’m reasonably good at suppressing the jealousy so I don’t start fights or anything, but I think I’d be a lot happier in my relationships if I could just be happy for them when they succeed.

What are some things I can do to improve myself?

t3_chf5vy,My bf (20M) is big and I (19F) am VERY small. Sex hurts! Advice?,"My bf of almost 4 years is pretty big and I am VERY small. There's a foot between us in height. We were both virgins before starting our relationship. We have only been having penetrative sex for 1.5 years. We have sex whenever there's time to -- usually 4-5 times a month.

We've tried different positions, lube, foreplay, and even weed to help me relax but nothing really works. The lube we have tried in the past stings and dries very quickly. We take it slow so that I can loosen up. Although I am ABLE to loosen and relax, this method is only successful 30% of the time.

I have anxiety and depression and take medication for it. The meds help a lot, but also reduce my sex drive a bit. I know that in the past anxiety has prevented me from being comfortable during sex, but now I'm worried that with a lower sex drive I'll never be able to figure it out!

I feel badly for him -- neither of us have ever finished during sex and I so SO badly want to be able to give that to him. He can last a long time (1+ hours), but sometimes I have to ask to stop because I don't loosen up and it just hurts too much!

They are divorced, but her mom couldn't manage to get a new place because of financial reasons so she still lives with him. Not only that, but her father can't pay the rent any longer which forces her(ex) to work extra and pay with the rent.

This situation is slowly getting the head of it and it makes it difficult to be with her. She has a lot on her mind now as she works long hours.

So I don't know how to feel right now. On the other hand I understand her situation, yet I can't seem to figure how to feel about. I'm sad, but not that sad as she said she still wants to be friends with me.

So my question is: do I have to wait for another chance? I'm still in love with her and want the best with her, but I don't know if this there's a chance with it.",relationship_advice
t3_ch3v3o,26M needs advice on raising orphaned sister 16F,"I am a 26M and 7 months ago I became the legal guardian of my half-sister (16F) Both her parents are deceased (we share same dad) so I volunteered to be her guardian as there aren't really other people to look after her. For most of out lives we lived apart and had virtually no contact and were estranged, it was only 7 months ago that we started building a relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We live together in a rented apartment and I work full-time. She has been badly misbehaving for the last 3 months or so, she is constantly getting in trouble at school (where I had to meet with teachers etc), she wont listen to whatever I say/ask, she wont help with household chores &amp; she sneaks out late at night (as far as I know, she never used to behave like this with her parents)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I generally try to be patient and understanding with her but I feel she walks all over me. If I try to be firmer then she'll only challenge me more. There are stretches of time when we get along and things are fine but then she starts acting out again when I try to enforce rules/boundaries.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Last night she snuck out at 2pm, so I tracked her down at the local park where she was drinking/smoking cigarettes, I was angry so ordered her to come home and go to bed, she got angry and hot me over the head with her phone, I was bleeding but not badly hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She came home but neither of us ahs spoken since then and things are tense.

What do you suggest I do? I feel frustrated and overwhelmed?

t3_chf56v,Not sure how to form male relationships! Help!,"When it comes to forming male relationships, most recent case for me is my coworkers, I always feel like they don’t like me.

I tend to always struggle with finding a balance between showing too much interest and trying to be kind of aloof.

I think that I tend to lean more towards being very attentive and show a lot of eye contact but then I realize that maybe I am showing too much eye contact and I don’t want to make them feel uncomfortable, but then I start feeling uncomfortable because I think I’m making them uncomfortable, then it turns into me just being and feeling very weird.

I am somewhat bicurious, which is why I think, when I find a guy attractive and then I get weird because I feel he knows and I don’t want to out myself, which I guess is a whole different issue.  

Holy shit I think as I’m writing this I’m realizing that maybe my issue lies in me not being comfortable with my sexuality, and I don’t want to be creepy towards straight dudes...

t3_chf51w,I (23F) accidentally gave my boyfriend (23M) a marriage proposal?,"A little background on myself: I have thought about getting married since I was a little girl. I know for some people a marriage license doesn’t mean a thing, but for me it symbolizes that a couple is willing to take the final step to secure their love for each other. My parents never married(they are still together) and 23 years after having me, my mother is still turning to me and saying “man, I think we will have a wedding soon.” Or “I want to start planning for a marriage.” After living with them and knowing my parents, I know that’s never going to happen and I always thought to myself yeah, I don’t want to be like them. My boyfriend has also known this too, it wasn’t like this came out of the blue. I thought he was on the same page but years later it has yet to happen.

My boyfriend(23M) and I(23F) have been together for five years. I started expressing to him that I wanted to get married at around 3, 4 years. I know many people would think that I’m too young to get married, but after half a decade of being with this man I know I want to spend the rest of my life with him. So around the end of the fourth year of being with him I realized that I was waiting for something that was never going to come. I texted him asking if we could meet up and told him simply, “if we are not on the same page then there is no reason to be with each other.” Fully intending to break things off with him.
He immediately got defensive and started going on about how we are practically already married. He pays for my food, we spend the night at each other’s houses all the time, he has helped me pay for school when I had no money, our families love each other, etc. His thought process overall was: we act like we are married already. I do so much for you. You do so much for me:  When he was telling me the things he has done for me are just as a husband would do for a wife, I started to see things from his perspective. The statement went from “things are not going to work out” to “okay, you do act like a husband to me already. I will wait and see what happens” and we decided to work through this and not split up. Of course during this conversation he was telling me we will get married if it makes you happen, it will come soon. 
Another interesting point that came from this conversation was him saying “I haven’t even lived with you yet, how am I supposed to know if we should even get married” after he said this I was visibly like ........??????????? I was blind sighted that after all of these years he is practically telling me he isn’t sure that he feels that he should get married to me. Besides, we have seen each other nearly daily since I was in high school. How could he be unsure if I am the person for him when I am practically begging him to think about taking the next step with me. 

Well it’s been almost a year since this conversation and as any one would guess, he still has not asked me to marry him. I am kinda in a sticky situation where he knows how I feel and I am expecting him to propose soon, yet I kinda placed an unexpected ultimatum on him and I don’t want him to propose just to make me happy if he does not feel the same way I do about marriage. 
Overall, I feel like those in a relationship shouldn’t work THIS hard to feel wanted in a relationship. Am I an idiot for still waiting, after five years, for a proposal that I am not sure is even coming?",relationship_advice
t3_chahzm,Found out co-workers were talking behind my (26F) back with my supervisor,"Not sure if this is the right place to put this, but I feel pretty bad and don't look forward to going to work today.

Story: I work in a place with a supervisor, managers, and technicians, for the past 9 months. I am a manager. I am also 5 months pregnant. We are given a 15 min break, 30 min lunch, then 15 min break. Lately my bathroom breaks (not counted) have become more frequent and longer, as my bathroom regimen has been changing due to the pregnancy (aka long number 2's because constipated). Right now I have gotten it down to once per work day. I had just come back from a bathroom break and had to chat with the supervisor about something, where I happened to glance at a chat she had opened, with a co-worker that read ""hellocanihelpyou25 went to her 30min bathroom break again, did you read the group chat? I feel bad for her partner."" This made me feel really bad, and when the supervisor caught wind that I saw it, she angrily said ""you shouldn't be looking at my screen"" and quickly closed all her windows. It's so strange because earlier today I was in great spirits (just returned from vacation) and everyone seemed so happy to see me (and plus they take just as long breaks too!!).... 


Anyways I just feel.... bad. It would have been better that someone brought this to my attention sooner, I would have tried to fix this right away. Also, I started at the same time as another co-worker, and it's pretty clear that they prefer her over me (they speak the same language, is older, has more experience) , but I didn't think they had a negative view of me until now. So this adds on to the imposter syndrome that I was already having. And it's no good, as they ousted a former coworker not long after I first started to the point where he was ""asked to quit."" 

Maybe I'm just over reacting? I don't know. I could take this up higher, but even the higher ups have done things that I'm not super fond of, where I don't trust them completely to have my back. I plan on taking shorter breaks and try to go to the bathroom less, but what can I do from here? I now dread going to work.... Negativity here spreads far faster here than positivity. I don't want to become the next ousted employee. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this, which is why I'm here. Any tips?

Throwaway because hes on reddit and I'm trying to be vague.

I've known my friend, since we were in high school. I had a crush on him back then for a bit, but I thought I grew out of it. He moved away came back moved away again and then he was the one to introduce me to my now ex boyfriend. After my most recent breakup we've been hanging out more together, and I'm starting to feel that crush again. 

And in a different situation I'd be cool with it but here are the issues:

I just got out of a long term.

He recently got out of a long term long distance.

Hes friends with my ex they're still super close and I dont want to get in the way of that.

I dont know if he feels the same and I dont want things to change if he doesnt.

I think he's interested in someone else.

So a bit of a backstory 
So I’ve just come out of a flirt with a girl, Christy, (it was nothing serious, we were just fooling around), but I think that Maria thinks that it was pretty serious (Maria told me to make the first move, and she was part of the reason that I did), but after I made the first move (very romantic) going to her home (9 km on bike from my home), where I then kissed her because she wouldn’t be home for over a week, so I just had to do it. When I told Maria about my plan she got really excited by the sounds of my plan
But after I then “flawlessly” executed my plan, Christy then tells me, that she has something going on with another dude, so that stopped pretty fast
(It was totally my fault, I should’ve kissed her earlier)

So after that, I’ve realized that I’ve actually had a crush on Maria for about two years, she had a crush on me two years ago btw, before I got a crush on her, but we’ve never done anything about it
Maria and I have been kinda flirting kissing at parties, cuddling, calling each other names as so forth.

So I don’t really know what to do about this situation, since I really don’t want to ruin anything between Maria and I, since she’s the kind of friend you can keep for a long long time
So I’m afraid to ruin anything by asking her out or making the first move, and I’m also afraid that she’ll feel as my rebound from Christy

TL;DR I’ve had a crush on one of my best friends for some years, and she’s also had a crush on me a couple years ago

t3_chf2jo,How do i control my father more?,"For the record i would like to say that i have a very close relationship with both my father and mother, but my family is a little bit different. My father is 76 years old, and my mom is 56. Its not too big a deal when you think of it but the last few years or so or whenever my dad hit 70 his age was starting to show. Also for the record im 19, my sister is 23 and i have 2 half brothers who are about 50. 
I would also like to state this isnt that big of a deal but kind of is, and that i love my father very much and hes a very intelligent and reasonable person.

So the problem is when in public my dad just kinda stopped caring. Hes at an age where he doesnt really care or not what he says infront of people. This happens alot and its kind of embrassing and very rude. What set it off was we were in line and my father said kinda loudly to have the women in front of us turn around and give him an evil look. He said i picked the wrong line, becaude they were going a little slower than normal. A little rude but whatever. After we left the store i told him in the car and how thats not acceptable and how the woman turned around. He said i dont care. So i said you should because it affects me too and its not nice for other people. 
After trying to explain to him(this same conversation we had before) about sometimes the things he does in public are rude. I think i got a little carried away, i was really angry and trying to prove a point so i would finnaly ingrave in his brain that what he is doing is bad. I said this makes me lose respect for you a little bit. He says good aslong as its little bit. I then say and theres a little bit more. Then i finnally say when you're on your deathbed and your asking all of us did i do everything in life right im going to stand there and say no. I felt kinda bad after saying that because my dads pretty aware that hes 76 and one of his sayings is thst hes not going to be here forever. Hes not really phased by things that much i assume he will be fine but i just got really mad.

How can i try to change my dads actions in public? I tried taking it very stirnly and harsh but did i go to far?",relationship_advice

t3_chaab0,Cutting contact w/MIL and her family,"Recently DH and I welcomed our first daughter together. Ever since she was born we have had some boundary issues with my MIL and her husband and step daughter(so not DH’s family) that my DH has talked to her about. Each time he talks to her she has turned the situation on me and blamed me for having a problem, or blamed why she can’t control her emotions on premenopausal issues. Also his step dad and step sister are very racist and have been trying to push that and their their religious beliefs on us. 
I never said much of anything about it until they started saying incredibly hateful things about my religion and horrible things about Filipinos and people of color because they’re not white. What they don’t know is that I have Filipino family and I myself am mixed. 
DH and I decided to have a conversation with his mother about the situation. We already knew we didn’t want his mothers husband involved in our children’s lives anymore because of everything he says. A little history he has always been like this, my husband has always expressed his disgust for him and has made it clear he does not think of him as family so we do not have a problem cutting him out. However we wanted to give his step sister another chance because she is younger and is simply a product of her environment. 
When we asked his mom to come over so we could talk she said she would bring the step sister, DH told her not until we talked to her first and things got ugly.

She refused to come over unless the step daughter could come, and then proceeded to call and text my husband about 20 times while we were talking and trying to figure out where to go from there because we wanted to have this conversation face to face. 
It became clear that was not an option, so we wrote up a text together and sent it. 

This is what the text read...

“So here’s the deal. I absolutely do not hate any of you, however the hateful and intolerant things (step daughters name) and (MIL’s husbands name) consistently say is something I will not allow our children to be around. I will be happy to let (step daughters name) come over still, but I need to talk to her about those things not being okay in our household. I think she is a wonderful young lady, I just don’t want her to teach or talk about religion to our kids. But (MIL’s husbands name) is not welcome here, I and our children will not be attending whenever he is present. I wasn’t raised to be intolerant of people who are of different race, or beliefs and that’s how we plan to raise our kids. Now about me being rude to you guys, that is not even slightly true. Im an introvert and I have never been one to talk a bunch or express a whole lot. I have been more defensive lately around you because since our daughter was born you have been too much for me to handle with asking about why I don’t bottle feed/pump, forcing a pacifier, having to see the baby every week etc. All of these things have made me very uncomfortable. I feel that we need some boundaries that you don’t understand unless we sit down and talk about it face to face. If you’d like to sit down and have a conversation about this please let me know. I would like our relationship to improve, I want you to know your grandchildren. But whatever we do from here we need to leave (DH’s name) out of it, we are both causing him unneeded stress.”

All she responded was “I want to hear this from my son that he agrees with all of this”
2 minutes later... “this is causing me a tremendous amount of stress and pain”
Another minute later... “Facebook is Facebook people are gonna voice there own opinions. We don't believe in homosexuality God is very clear about it being a sin just like any other sin. You clearly beleive that God accepts that sin. No one is going to force our beliefs on you or your kids. My husband is a good person and doesn't hate anyone. He is my husband and my daughters dad. Sometimes his comments seem a bit much but he's not a monster he's not evil. I just want to have a relationship with my son and grandkids. I don't always try to see the kids every week. I stopped posting pics of them on Facebook because of bothered you. I have given you and my son space. I don't know what else you want. I have paid the car you drive every month as well as the cell phone and have not once asked for any money back.”

Some more history..DH has had the car we both drive since he was 17, that yes his mom bought and he gave me his phone after he got his current job because they provide him a cell phone. We pay the insurance on the car, and the actual phone bill. She paid off the car before we met and the phone. 

So It was clear nothing we said was actually heard. So we discussed again what to do and decided to let her calm down and just not respond. 

Within an hour his mother had brought her step daughter and husband in to this whole situation. DH had started to receive messages from his step sister asking why he wasn’t standing up for “the family that loves him” and saying that I hate god and am ‘prosecuting’ them because they are children of god and that her dad is not a racist or hateful and that she would not deny god or stop spreading the word just because I asked her to deny god?(did anyone see where I told them to deny god? I just don’t want religion to be a subject around me or my kids). 
Then the icing on the cake, what truly solidified why I will have nothing to do with them again.

DH got this message from his step dad... “I guess by now you know about the text “my name” sent your mom about me, your sister and your mom right. If anybody’s intolerant it’s her , she wants to cast your family away I warned you about rescuing damsals in distress . Once she’s done alienating you from your family she will move on to the next guy. Since she wants to bring up the homosexual thing again it’s all through the Bible it’s a sin against creation and the Creator which makes it an abomination. And I’m sorry for saying this in a way but I’m not taking biblical advice from someone who’s an antichrist who ya cut their bodies up being on drugs has probably prostituted and participated in homosexual activities herself.” 

We have agreed to not allow any of them in ours or our kids lives anymore because of this. But I can see how hard this is for DH. He has been very depressed since this happened, I know it hasn’t been long but I don’t want him to resent me for cutting his mother out. Even though she isn’t saying the truly hateful things she stands up and backs her husband on what he says and believes he is not evil. I don’t think allowing someone like her in mine or our kids lives is a good idea. She has not contacted us since this happened but I know it’s only a matter of time. 

I’m just not sure what to do when she tries to come back and inevitably blame me for the division in their family again.

Me(23 cis m), my bf(21 trans m), and his best friend(21 cis f) all moved in together June 27th. Things have been pretty good aside from some adjustments to how we all handle cooking and food and things. 

Anyway, nearly all of our entertainment stuff is mine. All the game systems, the TV, the games, the TV stand, and the couch/almost all the chairs and we sit on are MINE. The only thing that isn’t mine is the Netflix account I don’t even use. This will be important a little later. 

I recently started working full time at a superstore(it sucks) and I’m gone 5 days a week from 2-11. My boyfriend, dealing with depression and generalized anxiety and a host of other fun issues, doesn’t really get up before 12 Most days. Not a big deal but a little annoying. I usually only see him for an hour or two before work and a few hours after I get home. 

While I’m gone, he and his bestie have taken to watching the Office a lot. Great show and I love it a LOT myself. When they watch, I take a seat and try to engage or to at least show I care even thought I’d rather be able to play my PS4 or my Switch. I just like spending some quality time around dude.

My boyfriend isn’t the same way. 

I love anime. Particularly action and adventure ones. I’m currently binging Attack on Titan season 3 because of the wild shit I’ve heard about it. So, whenever we’re all in the den but nobody is actually using the TV, I’ll start up my Hulu or VRV and watch AOT. My boyfriend though... is pretty weird about it.

His mood immediately sours whenever I do this. He’s not a fan of anime but it’s more than just having a bit of distaste for the medium. He gets upset when I defend my enjoyment of the art style and the series. It’s something only AOT really gets but other anime have annoyed him too when I watch. He leaves our den because he doesn’t enjoy it(which is perfectly fine) but he also asked me how much longer the series is gonna last so he can “finally do something”. He doesn’t leave the house unless he HAS to! I’m the only one here with a job( the best friend is job searching and he’s in a weird spot with a different job place that hasn’t opened) and I just wanna unwind with some AOT. 

I always ask him what he wants to do before I even start up my console and he always says idk. So, I decide to do something I know I wanna do and he always seems so bothered that it just feels weird. I’ve even told him before how I feel about all this and he says he’s sorry but he just keeps doing it and I feel awkward. I genuinely feel like I have to disregard his feelings to enjoy things. Am I taking this too seriously? I feel like I’m losing my damn mind sometimes.

t3_chev2z,How do I [M17] stop getting friendzoned?,"I'm 17M and I'm sick of getting friendzoned.

I've been talking to this girl and I really like her but I'm scared that it'll just end up like the last 3 times and I'll get friendzoned.

I've never even kissed a girl before but like I said I really like her and I think she's the one.

Have any of you got any advice on how to not get friendzoned and things to say to her to get the message across. I'm a really nervous person and I can't say it straight out that I like her even though I really want to.

t3_chev19,I (32/m) don't want my baby (11 days/f) around my mother (55/F),"I have a tumultuous relationship with my family. When I was 9 years old, my father (now 55/M) divorced my mother. This exacerbated a pre-existing condition of schizophrenia and anxiety and we were taken from my mother and placed with my father while she got the treatment she needed. This took about a year.

Living with her condition and herself, I later felt that she didn't really have the parental resolve to deal with us so I basically help raise my sister (currently 28/F). Shortly after my 17th birthday, my father moved halfway across Canada to be with my step-mom and step-sister. I continued through university and eventually graduated after dealing with a whole bunch of mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Throughout this, my mother mostly spent her time smoking and battling with her mental illness. She was never violent, and I love her very much. With that said, I never really felt she was there for me as she would often miss important milestones (including said university graduation).

Cut to today, she has missed pretty much all my major milestones less my wedding to my wife (33/F) 5 years ago. Even then, she left early and we couldn't dance together at our wedding. My wife and I now have an amazing, young daughter (11 days/F). When we were at the hospital, she didn't come on any of the days we were there despite my sister imploring her.

At this point, I feel I don't owe her a visit. I don't want my daughter to have someone in their life that they can't count on to be their in their lives. From my perspective, the relationship I have with my mother is toxic and I don't want to expose my child to that.

t3_cha6ew,gf (22) doesn’t let me (23) influence her decision about us,"I honestly can’t tell if this is mature of her or unfair towards me. Her and I have been dating for 3 years and it’s been really solid for both of us, but now I’m graduating. This along with a couple other road bumps such as an existential phase she goes through periodically has left her unsure about if she wants to continue forward and really commit. She decided she wanted a break after I was away for 2 weeks with family - but when I came back her resolve instantly broke. 

We ended up doing the break because I could tell it was going to be weird between us until this was handled, but something curious has happened. She doesn’t want me to talk in person or talk about the way she feels because she doesn’t want me to influence her decision BUT... she has been taking influence and support from her friends who barely know me or care about me. I worry that they will tell her what they think she wants to hear - and will over time, given that she won’t let me have a say - actually convince her and support her in a feedback loop that could cause her to make a mistake. 

Again maybe this is best and I haven’t addressed this with her in person, but I don’t like the idea that she’s venting to her friends about me and they are building her up without me like what we had was bad - and not giving me a say.  

Note: I know her friends are not giving her honest  support because I’ve seen/accidentally been sent a few messages/snaps over the last 3 weeks we were apart, and it’s pretty much them and her talking about me and them saying reasons why she shouldn’t get back w/ me and how she needs to be more strong and self assertive ‘hot girl summer’ etc. 

Note2: the good thing about these messages I wasn’t meant to see is it’s really apparent (and I kind of figured this knowing her) that she’s not interested in anyone else rn or interested in sleeping around)",relationship_advice
t3_chetmf,Me (18M) and My Ex-GF (20F) Recently Broke Up and She Wants Me to Go to Therapy with Her,"Lurked before, first post. Most of this is background, I'll put the tldr up top because I'm always annoyed when I have to scroll to the bottom for it: **I broke up with my ex-GF because she didn't like me having female friends. I had her meet some of my friends over a skype call after we broke up and my ex \*really\* hated me for this. She wants me to come to therapy with her to talk things over.** 

I first started dating my ex when I was 16 (sophmore in HS) and she was 18 (senior in HS). We continued to date long distance while she was away at college and I finished junior and senior year of HS. We both agreed that we had really good communication throughout this entire time period and were generally happy with how the relationship was going. 

We both have mental health issues and were good at supporting each other while we were dating (Me: Depression, anxiety, migraines; her: PTSD, depression). She has felt that therapy has helped her a lot and generally considered herself getting back much closer to ""normal"" with that intervention than me (I've been shuffling around medication dosages, doctors, therapists, etc. for basically the whole duration of the relationship and continuing into the present). We both have separate therapists and treatment and such but support each other (ie. no previous therapy sessions together). 

We ultimately broke up largely because my ex was very uncomfortable with my spending time with and talking about the female friends I have. While I understand (and she herself has said) that these feelings come past trauma, I didn't feel comfortable censoring every conversation I had with my ex to remove any mention of my female friends (which she asked me to do explicitly). 

Ex: I visited a female friend that I had known longer than my ex when I went on a trip during the first few months of us dating. I told my ex (frankly, in a rather stupid way, acknowledging that I had had a crush on friend in the past) and my ex has held a grudge against me for the whole relationship no matter how many times I apologize, bringing up this incident even 2 years later in the months before I broke up with her. 

Now, I was recently talking with some of my female friends on a skype call about my ex, and they wanted me to add her to call the call, because they knew that my ex hated them. I ultimately asked my ex first, who begrudgingly agreed, and she looked very sullen on the call, hating to meet them and such.

My ex felt that I paraded her in front of my friends in a mean-spirited way (which is somewhat true, I feel bad about it and felt I was slightly pressured into it by my friends). She wants me to come to a therapy session with her because she feels she didn't get any closure and that I haven't talked to her much other than this (we agreed to still be friends after breaking up, though I'm now rethinking this decision).

I got pissed in him about leading me on while he knew it wasn't meant to be. Then she broke up with him after a month when she realised he isn't serious and only wants to get physical.(I told her this and proved it to her) After the break up I've been getting really close to her and she ask me if I'm coming to our meet up place daily but I'm not so sure if she likes me and don't want to get ahead of myself.

t3_chepl9,My (15F) whole family (45F and 12F) wants my death. I don't feel safe in my own house,"My mom strongly believes I'm possessed by idk what demon, made me see an exorcist (yeah), say I'm a poison and all kind of thing. She threw me out the house when I was in 7th grade.
I had a bad teenage angst where we would often fight, but she threw me away 6 months after our last fight.
We rarely fight now to me, but to her a single swear word in her house is a manifestation of ""my demon and you should say lailayalala (with her accent) when you feel it coming.""
Once, I told my dad that she was always sleeping in the same room as my youngest siblings and when he told her to stop, she litteraly almost assaulted me and looked at me like she was gonna rip my eyes off as soon as I would hang up on my dad.

My sister is the golden child and pretty normal I thought.
We fought something as sisters do but now our relationship is pretty basic. She believes and tell everyone that I hate her cuz I never showed any kind of love toward her. It's true tho that i dont love her, I just dont feel any kind of love toward anyone from my family, but I dont ""hate her"", I just don't care.
Last year we had a fight, where I held her cheeks, for I dont remember what reason, and my mom hit my hand to let her go and since I had long nails, it left a slight mark on her cheeks. Everytime we see someone, she ""proudly"" show her scare telling everyone I did it. 
As I said, our relationship is basic, we laugh together sometimes and stuff. 

Few hours ago, my mom made unintentionally a joke about a complex of her and she started crying. I quietly laugh and litteraly the only person who could see I was laughing was my mom because she litteraly was in front of me. Now my mom told me to stop laughing and that it was my demon (him again) who was making me laugh. My sister (who I think is the possesed one) starting insulting me of all kind of thing I wasn't giving attention to and continued scrolling reddit. At one moment, she said I was a whore.
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against sex worker, but I know coming from her mouth and where I live, it was really really insulting. So I hit her on the back on the head.
Boy, little do I know I just declared WW3. My mom and my sister litteraly jumped on me, one telling me to go outside and reciting things to calm my homie da demon and the other screaming insult again and again. After I punched her little brat head, I went back to my reddit scrolling, when I heard her say she wanted to strangle me, see my father beat me with his belt to death and other sweet and loving stuff. Then she said she wanted me to get rapped by Daesh. So yeah I hit her again.
Now we're both in our room. Everybody is attending her's like it was the next trendy gala everybody needed to attend, and I'm here, sitting in my room, writing this post.

t3_chbn4m,My (25M) new GF (24F) has a history with my daughter's stepdad.,"**Background** 
I am recently back in the dating scene after seperating from my daughter's mother a little over a year ago. The three of us (daughter, her mom, myself) have a great relationship and co parenting is going great. My ex is engaged to a guy and they seem to be doing great and from everything I can tell he is a great father. 
I started dating someone 2 weeks ago. Trying to take it slow so we are still getting to know each other. 

**Issue:**
My GF shared with me that she has some history with my Ex's Fiancee. They were very close while he was going through a divorce but did not officially date. I have no issues with this part, we live in a small town so these things tend to happen often. 
The part I am struggling with is that my daughter has a birthday party coming up. I really want my girlfriend to be there as this will be a good opportunity to introduce her to some close friends and family. **For all intents and purposes I am a guest at this party. My Ex is hosting and planning for the most part.** With this being said, I do not wish to cause any drama between my ex and her fiancee but I feel like I should give them a heads up regarding this whole situation. My gf does not yet know about the party but I dont want her to find out after the fact when pictures from the party show up on social media.

Do I talk with my ex? Do I go behind my ex and try to reach out to her fiancee? Or am I overthinking and should just bring my GF no questions asked?

t3_ch7web,Husband [33m] emotional affair with neighbor [37f] - wife [30f] saw fb chat in real time,"Married 6 years. I was working on my computer at the coffee shop when notifications of my husbands conversation on Facebook kept popping up on my computer. They were talking live so I got to witness the betrayal in real time. 

The conversation was about wanting to kiss and being attracted to each other. The other person is a woman he volunteers with regularly. I responded in the chat something to the effect of “your wife is at work and getting real time notifications of this. I’m coming home, the home where you live with our 4 children”

I came home immediately. He took ownership of it and admitted he royally fucked up. He didn’t make excuses, he talked about how he had been insecure and flirting and talking boosts his ego. My husband and the neighbor say nothing has ever happened between them physically. I reluctantly believe him.
He then confessed that in the past he has talked with anonymous women on reddit for the same type of attention. One time things, flirting sometimes just chatting, and not sexting. He said at the time he thought it was harmless, a way to blow off steam when he was feeling stress or not getting attention in our relationship.
He is what I believe to be genuinely remorseful for his actions. Said he will respect whatever choices I make moving forward. 
But I can’t help to feel he’s only sorry because he got caught. 
He offered to go to counseling, give me space, work whatever way he can to not lose our family, and quit the volunteer program. 
We’ve dealt with the loss of his father, and some really really hard times over the last few years. Without me knowing it he had already been working with his therapist about this specific issue.

t3_ch7vmo,"Told bf I love you, his reply is that he isn’t there yet!","TL;DR Told boyfriend I loved him after a year and a half and he isn't there yet, what do I do?

Well i already posted and deleted this so hopefully I’m just as thorough. My bf and I have been dating for a little over a year now and I invited him with me for my friends birthday to Miami this recent weekend. With all the issues we were having lately I thought this will be good to have some time together!!

A little background info. He’s white im black, we don’t live together and do not have my kids or dog children. I work full time and he just recently got his degree and is looking for a full time job.

When we first started dating he told me I was his first relationship and that he wanted to take things slow. I agreed because I didn’t want to rush into anything either. While we were dating I noticed his love languages were physical touch and quality time. So I had to make some adjustments because I’m not a touchy person and I love to be alone. So I told him that I do t like o be touched when I’m upset or angry and as long as he respected those boys it’s we would be good. He reacted that and I learned to cope with him touching me all the time. 

About a month ago he pulls me aside and says he feels like we’ve become distant and feels like I’m not making him a priority. I’m taken aback by this because I didn’t see it. I tell him that I am sorry he’s feeling this way I had no Intentions to do something like that. Like I said I like being alone and I think he thinks this is my way of saying I don’t want to hang out with you. Not it I work 40+ hours a week dealing with people sometimes I wanna unplug and nap. I tell him this he says okay.
However I tell him that I don’t like it that he makes disrespectful and uncomfortable “jokes” when he is Intoxicated. This is not the first time we’ve talked about this. He apologizes, acknowledges it and we move on.

So last weekend we are in Miami. And what is the first thing he does when we get there? Gets drunk and makes me totally uncomfortable in front of my friends and her mother! They all look at me with a cringe face so I get up and go to bed. Not addressing it. One night we are alone at the bar and I was a little tipsy but I figure hey why not? 

I’m so happy he’s there with me and my friends, and I realize that I don’t have to be nervous or scared to say it right? He’s here with me I should just say I love you. So I do, and he goes “uhh I don’t know what you want me to say, you know how I feel about that. I’m just not there yet”

I’m shocked. I shut down and don’t know what to say. What should I do at this point. What is it going to take to get him there? I should also says he’s a great guy and despite the alcohol I do mean it.",relationship_advice

I think it’s great that she wants to serve, but I was just planning on her coming back home and continuing our relationship together.

She shared that she would most likely be gone for a year and we don’t have a solid foundation within our relationship for it to last that long. She asked what I wanted to do so I decided to stay by her side till I know if she can transfer, when she would leave, and how long. The reason in writing this is to get some advice if I should break up with her. I have a feeling that she will transfer soon and I know the break up will be harder if I continue to stay with her. Also, she had a hard time deciding whether to stay or go active and I believe if I called the relationship off then she could follow her dreams of helping others and travel.

t3_chbiy0,Getting over an ex ??? ( f20),"My ex broke up with me Sunday because he didn’t want to be in a long distance relationship that is 2 hours away. He was basically saying that to be in the long distance  relationship there was more sacrifices than wantings to stay in the relationship basically and he was saying that we’re on two different levels . He was saying that he thinks that he’s more mature than me and is using this example because when he broke up with me I went on twitter ( because I was shocked ) and tweeted “ I’m single now new dick pls” and said that it was immature of me but I only tweeted it because I was in shock and just wasn’t thinking straight. And he also brought up how that I’m a strong woman but I don’t use my full potential and he wants a partner that will use their full potential but he said that requires growth and he said that because we’re still young so that brings back to him saying that he’s not ready to be in a long distance relationship . I’m 20 and he’s 22. And he was really a great guy and we didn’t like have a bad breakup because we have respect for each other but now I’m just scared that I’m not going to find someone better. 


how that like when one day he told me that he wanted to use my full potential ( because he wants a strong woman) and he wants someone that uses their full potential and he was saying how he thinks we’re at different levels ( he thinks he’s more mature ) and he used for an example that I tweeted “ I’m single now new dick pls” he said that was thirsty and immature of me so yeah that’s pretty much how it went",relationship_advice

I don't know what to think or to do from here. Josh is venting to me and the rest of our group about how he feels and what do if she finds someone else. We hung out with him for a couple hours today just so he can keep his mind off of things. Its going to be hard for him but we want to support him.

Amy, on the other hand has been feeling  frustrated and says that what they had isnt there anymore for her. She didnt want to keep the relationship going if she  didnt feel that connection anymore. So that was when she told me about it. She explained that it wasn't him and she thinks its herself. 

Being good friends with both of them, I don't like that this happened but I understood that this was something I couldn't control and shouldn't be too involved. I gave advice to both of them and stayed in a neutral position. Being in this position is stressing me out and I don't know how to remove the tension in the air when I talk to either one of them.

We all hang out every couple of days but now i dont know how things are going to be.

t3_ch8jno,My (17F) Friend (19F) is a plagiarizing others work,"We met at art school 2 years ago, she was a good student at the start, but as the months passed she started slacking of and not doing work, sleeping in class and ignoring teachers. Outside of class she is nice and talkative, so we became friends.

 Two months after meeting I started believing that my friend copies other peoples work and calls her own. I'm not saying that she uses references or copies other artists as practice. That's what we do in class.

To elaborate a bit, both of us are into anime and as consequence started drawing because of it, and when not doing exercises for school we fall back on the good old ""anime OC"". I started having my suspicions when I noticed that her artwork was very inconsistent,  her work was always switching ""anime"" styles. At first I thought it was normal because I did the same, drawing characters with elements from art I liked. It's how you develop your skills and style.

The first clue came when she plagiarized someone's work of the internet for a drawing for class. We were ask to do a illustration for one of Kafka's books. She copied a drawing, but she admitted it, even joked about the fact. I didn't do much, I wasn't happy about it, but I thought it was only a one time thing and it was better than doing nothing for the exercise. She got caught and the teacher simply told her to restart and do something of hers. It didn't seem like it was a big deal to anybody.

Now, for and outside spectator it may seem obvious that she plagiarized work. But it's a big deal calling someone, what is essentially, a criminal. The teachers don't even notice when she shows a her personal artwork because they aren't familiar with the anime art style. So I thought at the time I was just overeating and that she would eventually gain a style.

But recently I saw irrefutable prof of her plagiarism. She was showing me her drawings and I saw artwork from an artist I follow. Until then I suspected some of her artwork wasn't hers as it didn't match the skill or style of the works in class and always seemed familiar, but I couldn't pinpoint the original artwork. But that one I knew so I asked about the drawing trying not to imply that I knew the original artwork and that she copied it to paper and painted with copic markers. She told me that it was from a new manga of hers, I said it felt like I'd seen that character before but she just dismissed it and kept showing the rest of the sketch book. I didn't confront her.

What should I do? How can explain her how it's wrong and stealing without losing the friendship. I don't want her making a future out of stolen work, and I feel like I should do something because next year is our last year together.

By the end of the year, things were over. I was constantly asking what we were and showed major signs of neediness and dependence. Her response was it wasn't the right time for her, she enjoyed her freedom (not whoring around) and then left the window open for me. My response, no texting or hanging out for a while, but that didn't last too long as she thought it was unfair and i thought why throwaway a good relationship. So we continued to hang out and text every now and then (she initiates most texts, as I initiate more of the hanging out [she doesn't like asking people to chill]).

Fast forward to now. Since that talk, we really only hung out at my place, around once a week. Caught signals here and there, but things could never develop because my house has some annoying individuals, and I was hesitent. But, this latest time we hung out, I decided to vaguely suggested her place. To my surprise, she offered her place (haven't been there since the talk). I went over, we smoked in her car, chopped it up, and jammed out to some music she liked to hear (from MS to recent years). Afterwards, we went inside to her room and she told me to get comfy while I watch a show (she's moving, so she was packing up her room). During the first 10 min, I'm constantly pausing because she's telling me something about her stuff or I'm teasing her about her stuff (all laughs and fun). And to my surprise, she crawls in bed next to me, not even 3 inches away in booty shorts (butt popping out), to watch a show she has already watched. But...

Not even 2 min in, her niece comes in to play. So you know, I play with her and make her laugh (I'm not just doing it to impress her. I rather enjoy playing around with babies). I get her involved as well, so we're teasing around some more. After some time, my lady friend needed to leave, to do something for her eventual apartment. As we walk to our cars, she says she wishes she didn't have to be responsible, we hug, exchange goodbyes and be safes,  and go our ways. 

I just want to know what this seems like to you guys: close friends or something more? I like her, but I haven't felt the right time to tell her again. I'm pretty sure she knows, but I'm pretty aloof and deattached compared to last year. Just looking for an opinion. Thanks.",relationship_advice

t3_chbf0k,I [20M] can’t stop thinking about this girl [19F] I met despite being in a happy relationship with my girlfriend [20F],"Hi everyone, it’s my first time posting on reddit so I’m not really sure how to go about this... but here goes:

I’m [20y] currently in a 3 year long relationship with my girlfriend [20y]. However, I had never “crushed” on her per se, and she was the one who confessed her feelings for me. I decided to give the relationship a shot and I ended up falling in love with her. Now, we both love each other a lot and both of us are very committed to each other. We’ve made it clear to each other that marriage is a goal we are working towards, and we are both convinced that each of us has found “the one” (or at least I thought so).

Recently, I met another girl [19y] in an overseas university placement interview. I started talking to her during the pre-interview waiting phase to get to know the other interviewees and to pass the time. Admittedly, she was gorgeous but I had no intentions to forsake my relationship or cheat or anything of that sort. I talked to her on a completely platonic level and I wanted to keep it that way. 

Surprisingly, we clicked almost instantly, on levels I had never experienced before. 

We shared many similar interests and even wrt our religious views. I was almost drawn to her personality and demeanor instantly. This was the first time I’ve ever experienced such a strong “crush” on someone. Right after the interview, as I was about to head home, she came over to talk to me. She asked me where I was heading and I told her I was heading towards the mall (beside the train station). She asked me if it was okay for her to follow me. I was fine with it so I said yes. It was raining and she didn’t bring an umbrella so I offered to share mine with her (as an kind gesture). However, as we walked close together underneath the umbrella, I felt an unfamiliar feeling of warmth and excitement rushing through me. We continued talking, and the conversation carried on so easily it was amazing. Then she asked if I had already eaten. (I hadn’t). I wondered if she was going to ask me to eat lunch with her, so I lied to her and said I had, because I wanted to honor the commitments I had with my girlfriend, and I didn’t want give her the wrong idea. (I was not going to forsake my relationship). But deep down I really wanted to for some reason.

Eventually we reach the point where we had to depart from one another. At that point, I felt devastated. I’ll probably never ever see this girl again (unless we both get accepted into this particular university and both accept the offer which is highly unlikely). I was conflicted. I wanted to ask if we could swap contacts and stay in touch but again, I felt horrible about the idea of doing so (because of the commitments I had made with my girlfriend, and because I know how horribly she would react to it), so we just waved goodbye and it ended all so abruptly. I remember the last few words she said being “see you soon... I guess, or maybe not, anyways see you...” and I could sense she was was feeling the same way I was as well. Stunned, I stood there awkwardly as her figure faded into the distance. 

It’s been weeks and I still can’t get her out of my head. I feel the immense urge to see her, to talk to her perhaps just one last time... I managed to find her social media (I remembered her name and the education institutions she attended) but I’m hesitant to dm her. After all, what in the world am I doing messaging a girl I’ll probably never meet again when I’m already in a happy relationship...?? I feel guilty for keeping this a secret from my girlfriend but we’re both fairly insecure and I know how negatively she would’ve react to it so here I am. I keep thinking about how well we bonded, how attractive she was, how there was a spark between us that I’ve never experienced before, even for my current relationship. I still love my girlfriend a lot, but the feeling of “what if...” is haunting me. She very well felt like she could be “the one” (if such a thing exists). I’m at a loss for what to do. If at all possible, I don’t want to implicate my girlfriend in this at all and I feel highly uncomfortable broaching this subject with her. What should I do?

tldr: I’m in a relationship but I met a girl that I can’t stop thinking about because of the spark we had during our interaction, that I’ve never ever had with my current girlfriend

I have no way to put it other than very bluntly so I’m just gonna outright say it. She won’t/absolutely refuses to do oral. I thought I would be ok with that and I have not/will not disrespect that boundary with her because I’m not an asshole. We have talked about this after I realized it was going to be hard for me (pun not intended). She told me in no uncertain terms that if I wanted head I could go out and get it from another person. This however makes me really uncomfortable because that feels like cheating to me because it’s not like I can go walk outside and get a blowjob on demand. 
I don’t want to seem like someone whose like ‘oh my relationship sucks I don’t get head’ because it doesn’t I’m just nervous that if I actually go ahead and do what she said is ok it will actually not be ok and fuck things up.

t3_chebzb,Going through somebody's phone.,"(Yes, I know going through a phone is wrong this is just part of a conversation being had.)

Is it only wrong to be suspicious if the person in question isn't doing anything wrong? Like does the blame shift from the one accusing to the accused if the accused is found guilty? How would should this interaction work in your opinion?

(Example we are working with rn. He says he feels that she's being shifty and feels she's talking to somebody behind his back. She says she's not and doesn't want to prove it (obviously her right.). We know that she's having conversations where somebody (another guy) has called her babe just from an accidental glance one time but isn't going to call her on it yet.)

t3_cheai8,He [21 M] told me [20 F] he was ready for a relationship when he wasn't.,"I met someone a couple of months ago and he was really sweet. He seemed to fall for me almost instantly, but he didn't really have my attention at first. I thought he was funny and kind and smart but I was really happy on my own, being independent and being productive without a relationship causing a distraction. I told him that I wasn't looking for a relationship anytime soon and that I didn't expect him to wait around for me. I've also been in plenty of toxic relationships before so I didn't want to fall for someone who could be potentially hurtful just because he seemed to make a good first impression. However, he really insisted on getting my attention. For months he worked really hard to win me over, I met his friends, I met his family, we spent a lot of time bonding, we both made big sacrifices to make things possible especially because he lives in another city. Even throughout all of this I was still hesitant, I didn't want to fall for him unless I was sure. One day, in a call to me, he told me that he really wanted to finally make this official, and that he didn't want to spoil anything but he just couldn't wait to see me again because he thought it was about time. Needless to say that was my queue. He seemed really serious and I was smitten. But I saw him again, and he didn't bring it up. And again, and he didn't bring it up. Over and over I've seen him and he hasn't made it official. I finally brought it up today because I let myself fall really hard since then, and all he had to say was how he was wrong, he wasn't ready yet, and that I should just wait (indefinitely?) until he decided that he was. I can't explain why this hurt me so much but I did, and after trying to explain my feelings to him he said that I was being selfish, not considering what he's done for me, and that if he makes it official now it'll be all so that I can have a hollow ""girlfriend"" title and it wouldn't really mean anything to him because as he said, he's not ready.
He apologized the next day and said he just needs time, but all of a sudden I feel really repulsed and hesitant to continue this. I don't know what's right anymore. Am I wrong to feel this way? Should I give him more time? I guess to summarize what I'm feeling: I'm simply upset because I didn't want a relationship in the first place, and he went out of his way to make me fall for something that I didn't need. Now that he's got me, I'm hanging on indefinitely. I really like him, I think he's an amazing guy, but this is the reason I didn't want to fall for someone in the first place. I just don't know if it's worth waiting around for a title that may or may not always be ""hollow"" to him.",relationship_advice
t3_ch9m3p,Could use some advice on gf's ex,"My gf and I are in our late teens and she is about 3 months out of a 3 year relationship with her ex. She has made it very clear on multiple occasions that she wants nothing to do with him anymore, and I've told him to back off. We all go to the same school, so escaping him isn't an option.
Today was about the 5th time we've told him to back off. Each time it seemed like he got the picture, but then a couple weeks later he'll start shit again. Every time he does, it makes my gf breakdown and because her home life is pretty rough, she is not mentally equipped to deal with his bull shit.
The last couple times we've told him to back off, he's threatened to ”deck” me and once my gf. The last time he did so I told him to name a time and a place, which made him back off a tad.
This last incedend seemed like a pretty conclusive agreement that he'll leave us alone, and vice versa. This has been the case 5 times before though, so I am very doubtful.
This whole situation is taking a serious effect on my mental health, and even more so on my gf. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_b2nc2f,[meta] Think of the comments as an inverted Uber rating. (click to find out what this means),"Since two or three times a week we end up removing a few threads on why everyone keeps suggesting breakups, rather than micromanage the community, we figured this post would be prudent:

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all ""A+++ WOULD RIDE AGAIN."" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

Well, think of /r/relationship_advice comments as much the same, only inverted. Two things to always keep in mind:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are insurmountable (or just exceedingly difficult to deal with). 

**The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened—your account—with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark,** meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like ""dump"" and ""lawyer up."" 

The _key_ is that the number of serious comments telling you to _consider an alternative to breaking up_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to continuing what you've got going. Examples:

* Let's say you're asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag, and that behavior is so bad, the flag's not so much dyed red as it is _literally bleeding._ Nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run. Cool; **Zero Stars.** Shoot I might even lock the thread and tell you it's above our paygrade.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the **three to four stars territory.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? Probably **four to five stars.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

This applies to platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic either, but for the sake of not needing a TLDR for the TLDR, I'm avoiding listing every single condition. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude, so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of ""break up with them."" If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you should definitely consider giving that 25% a chance.

You get the drift? 

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to break up. It's a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than breaking up, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

Yeah, this is the kind of analysis that happens when a sub's been around for almost a decade. It's also long overdue considering we're at over 1.3m subs and y'all are always so grim. shrug. ~~***Comments open for 72 hours or less,***~~ edit: which is to say that we'll take feedback on this and whether there _should_ be any changes to encourage people to be more positive with the advice they give... but honestly, we'd rather not unless someone comes up with an exceedingly compelling reason. If you disagree with a downer, just downvote it.

t3_chm8zl,How do I repay my boyfriend for his kindness?,"Throwaway because I don't want him to see this 

My boyfriend (29) and I (25F) have been dating around 6 months. I go to school full time and work part time and he works full time and a fair bit of overtime as well. We don't have conventional 9-5 jobs so our weekends are harder to align together to be able to see each other. I have PCOS (ovarian cysts which make periods delightfully awful) and am on the pill to treat it but sometimes they have a mind of their own.

Last week, by some miracle we both had 3 days off together. Excited to make the most of it, he planned a hike and a big lunch after for day one, and two full days of being lazy, eating and having sex, all in front of the tv. Sounded perfect. 

Well morning of day one he was going to pick me up and we'd be off on our hike, but as soon as I woke up, the beaches of Normandy had been stormed. It was D-Day. 2 days early. Absolutely fan-fucking-tastic. I am crap at remembering to take the pill, this is my own fault.

Because of our haywire schedules and limited time together I had successfully managed to not see him when the Bolsheviks invaded. We hadn't even had the conversation about what happens for us during the invasion (do we have sex or not). But I couldn't do that this week. We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks it was starting to frustrate both of us.

I was miserable, I wanted to down an entire bottle of Midol and stay in bed. I texted him, ""Morning! Please don't hate me but could we hang out tomorrow instead and still do our weekend thing? My stomach is absolutely killing me right now"". 

He called when saw the text this is almost verbatim our conversation.

Him: shit, what's wrong??

Me: Nothing, I just woke up and my stomach is all crampy. It happens sometimes, I'll be fine tomorrow. I just need to stay in bed and not move very much.

Him: Did you eat something off yesterday?
Me: I don't think so, it will be fine tomorrow don't worry.

Him: You could still come over. We don't have to do the hike. We'll wear socks and slide around. Or I will and you can watch me 

Me: I really want to see you but I'll be shit company. 

Him: shut up you're never shit company. (Pause) Yo are you on your period?

Me: yeah ugh. How did you know?

Him: (laughs) take a shower. I'm coming to get you. 45 minutes okay?

Me: yeah it's okay. you're fine with me just being moody on your couch?

Him; yeah bitch. 45 minutes. Go.

I asked him how he figured out in the car and he said that once a month I'd get really weird about seeing him even if had time off and he thought horses when he heard hooves, not zebras. 

He handed me a bottle of Midol as soon as I got into his car  A liquor store stop and an hour later I was on his couch, good and drugged up, cradling a heating pad like the baby my uterus longed me to have, hating myself for being such miserable company and annoyed at him for making me want to see him so badly. He had disappeared into the kitchen while I repeatedly stabbed his undeserving remote combing through Netflix. He came back clutching a mug of some orange lemon tea that smelt like summer in one hand and a big plate of French fries in the other, looking very pleased with himself and rightfully so. I would have jumped up and hugged him had I not actively been trying to stop my uterus from self destructing. We traded the tea for the remote. He put on a Hitchcock movie to distract me, We wrapped up in a blanket and cuddled.

We took a break midway through to use the bathroom and smoke. The pain had considerably subsided by then. When we were outside he asked if I wanted to try some yoga to help with the pain. I told him it might feel a little awkward doing it, knowing he'd see me. So he OFFERED TO DO IT WITH ME. He'd found a whole bunch of videos on YouTube and downloaded them all. I should add that he's a big muscular guy, goes to the gym very regularly and loathes stretching but afaik begrudgingly does it. He's the guy who will tell you to never skip leg day.

Some of them required a fair bit of bending in awkward positions. We did them together, there were mock wails of wounded pride from him after he couldn't fold his legs for more than 10 seconds and from later almost falling over in a seated position. It was fun, he tried to give the poses new names, tried to bark during downward dog and ended up farting instead. That made us both laugh. It was the cutest thing, watching him laugh and fart with pride. It helped my pain, I'd forgotten how miserable I was and was just so grateful for him and his company. I told him how amazing he was and how much I appreciate what he was doing and just brushed it off. 

I woke up before him and wanted to wake him up to a cooked breakfast as a thank you and decided on cinnamon french toast. He eats eggs and toast for breakfast most of the time, and even though french toast is those ingredients they're strictly only for special occasions. It's his absolute favorite breakfast. I prep and wait for him to wake up.

When he wakes up and goes to the bathroom, I heat up the pan and begin toasting the first slice. He smells the cinnamon, comes running, sliding on his socks into the kitchen, screaming, ""CINNAMON BITCH"". He's so excited! I thank him once again for being so wonderful yesterday and hug him and he just brushes it off, more interested in breakfast. I have to practically push him out of the kitchen so I can serve him properly instead of tossing it on his outstretched plate like it's Oliver Twist.

I was raised to believe that getting your period was something really embarrassing and it has to be hidden away and never talked about; especially not with a boyfriend/male friend. He just blew all that up, didn't faze him, he was just his sweet ass self. In the past I've had my exes reschedule, get grossed out or straight up shame me for it, even if I said we didn't have to have sex, so this was so refreshing and thoughtful of him. 

I need to show him how much I appreciate what he did for me and saying thank you feels empty. He gets uncomfortable with verbal compliments.  I mean the man is acting like three slices of eggy cinnamon bread was a 7 course meal cooked by Wolfgang Puck and served by a naked Scarlett Johansson. I want him to know how much I appreciate him but don't know what to do.


Please help.

t3_chjz4o,Wife suddenly locking phone,"Throwaway account.

My wife has more integrity than anyone I know. She wont even let us run both vehicles through a gas station for the full 30 gallons when we claim fuel perks.

But about two months ago she started texting another guy she met through work. She is in sales, he is a client. The dude is in an unhappy marriage and is clearly hitting on my wife. I have warned her about it, told her i am not a fan, but i am not going to babysit her and I trust her. She gives me regular updates abt how she keeps trying to help him fix his marriage. 

She has been dealing with a lot of stress. Sunday she disappeared for 3 hours. Claims she had a panic attack and just drove somewhere and then passed out. She said she had talked to the guy via text during her panic attack and he went looking for her but never found her... like i said i want to trust my wife, but then the following happened.

Today she was hospitalized, i came home she was passed out unresponsive and hyperventilating, remained that way for nearly an hour until she awoke.  Diagnosis was a severe panic attack. I grabbed her phone to take to the hospital and went to call her boss to let her know she wont be in. Her phone had a password lock on it. In the 7 years we have been married, neither of us have bothered to lock our phones. It wasnt any of our usual combinations either. So when she woke up i asked for the password and she said ""thats something I take to the grave."" 


She is hiding something from me and I dont know how to confront her about it. I let it go tonight because there were more important things going on, but i now am seriously concerned about this.

Tl;dr. Wife wont let me unlock her phone for the first time in 7 years of marriage.


Update: after posting this I couldnt sleep. She was still awake (texting that guy) and i came downstairs and basically told her that if she doesn't let me see the messages,  I have lost all trust in her.

She relented after much debate. (Good sign) there were only about 3 days worth of texts bc her phone deletes the oldest after so many texts. But in those 3 days worth of things the guy said he still hasnt told HIS wife (even though my wife was supposed to cut off contact 2 weeks ago if he didn't)

He kept mentioning his sexual experience and big dick. (3 times in a day) because my wife ADMITTED SHES ONLY EVER BEEN WITH ME. He would push until she commented it was inappropriate, and then resort to saying it was a joke. 

She was hiding it for a few reasons from what I can tell.

1. She complains about me to him (but she also compliments how much i do when she isnt feeling well)

2. She's talked about our sex life and how dysfunctional she is with sex. (To which he inferred she needed a better teacher and he had plenty of experience... but her husband (me) would probably not like another guy telling him what to do in bed.

3. She is venting to him about her emotional issues instead of me.

So she is teetering on an emotional affair, whether she realizes it or not. And the dude is using her as an escape from his bad marriage. I told her i dont feel comfortable with them talking anymore and her response was ""so i am not allowed to have guy friends?""


Update #2. 
Tried to be more talkative with my wife. Mend things. She insisted on talking about Dave even after I told her i wasnt ready to. So i blew up via text bc i am working. Sent her the wikipedia article on emotional affair. SHE ADMITTED THAT IS WHAT IT IS. And is now trying to defend it as not being any worse than when she complains to her girl friends. All while still claiming all she wants is me. Yet insisting she gets to stay friends, just not so close.


I told her that her having the option to run to him when having a bad day keeps her from needing us to work on our relationship. Will keep all y'all posted.",relationship_advice

Sooo I told Natalie that she has to either tell eric or I will. A shitty ultimatum. but I was very serious and even typed out a text to tell him and showed her. She said she was very certain it was his baby since apparently she only fucked Dylan PIV like three times, I guess I kept walking in on them and assumed it was more frequently than it was. But she told him herself. Which was a relief since I couldn’t do that. She told Eric that she wasn’t loyal but the baby was his and he was angry anyway and he broke up with Natalie. The thing was she was supposed to move in with him and all that so her plans were ruined. But yeah I guess he didn’t care after all if that was his baby or not since she cheated. Idk she was really sure that he was the father but neither wanted to pay for a paternity test since it’s expensive. Listen idk she said Dylan pulled out but she lets eric finish inside since she’s usually on birth control. 

She also cut our friendship after all that and hates me now. I asked some of our other friends and she’s probably gonna get an abortion because she can’t do it alone. Dylan found out and thinks it’s his baby and wants to be there for her but she basically told him that he’s nothing to her and fuck off and never talk to her again. He still likes her , I don’t know why since she’s mean to him and he could get any other girl but he liked her since elementary school.

t3_chmkwr,Cheating wife,"I(36M) need help, from people that I don’t know, that can give maybe give impartial comments on my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently found out my wife(32F) of 3 years (been an a relationship for 15) has been having an affair with a male(42M) from her work.

Her phone went off one morning and something made me check it, that was it I seen everything. They were saying they missed each other, photos of each other naked had been shared. My word fell apart as I was scrolling though the deceit and lies.

&amp;#x200B;

I confronted her later that day. She confessed it had been going on for months, they had slept together twice and she was developing feeling for him and he had feelings for her. Her reasoning was he was someone to talk to, they would lunch together, chat over email at work. 

This left me feeling empty, was I not good enough, when I asked her this she said she felt she could no longer speak to me about her feeling and speaking to someone new was easier. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her to leave our marital home and she has been away for about two weeks now living with friends. We’ve met for coffee a couple of times but the chats go round in circles as I can’t seem to move past it. 

She wants to have me back, she wants our relationship, she claims to have stopped chatting to the male from her work.

I feel I want to give our relationship a chance but I want terms and conditions, but I need help what do you people feel should be my conditions? how do i move past the affair?",relationship_advice

Hello, it's me. Sorry about the new username, I made the first account thinking I would just post &amp; read the replies, so I couldn't remember the password as it was just a jumble of letters. Didn't expect so many responses, thanks for your insight everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

It seems folks were split on whether I was being: 1) an arrogant dick, or 2) completely clueless. I think it was probably a little of both. After spending years of slogging by in medical school living like a student, making so much money does really excite me, and I probably came on too strong with offering to buy her everything. It wasn't meant to be condescending, I just want to share my newfound wealth with the people I care about. But, as many of you said, it was patronizing to try and solve her issues with money and to throw it around like it means nothing to me. In the future, I will be a bit more mindful of money can cause a power imbalance in relationships. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is kind of a non-update, but I wanted to at least thank everyone for the help and tell you that I will take your advice and ease up a bit. I don't want to make her uncomfortable and feel like she's indebted to me. A couple of you suggested a take a page from her book and learn how to budget myself, so yesterday I texted her and asked if she could help me, and she said (and I quote), ""Yes, of course! Budgeting is fun, you'll love it!""

&amp;#x200B;

Color me skeptical. But she clearly knows what she's doing, and, knowing her, she probably will make it fun!

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing, to everyone who thinks I just came on here to brag about my wealth: the next time you're rolled into the OR, you'll be glad to have a competent, well-paid anesthesiologist in the room to take care of you.

t3_chgf7m,[UPDATE] I (23F) made an ultimatum to my fiance (31M).,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cggcrf/my_so_wbpd_is_away_at_his_familys_house_and_id/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Well, I took all your advice into consideration and made my ultimatum (leaving out the bit about inpatient). I was calm, understanding, and tried my best to be caring throughout the conversation.

His initial reaction was positive. He said he had no problem helping clean and do therapy homework for 5 minutes a day, so I thought that was that.

Today he told me he shouldn't have to do his diary card anymore since he isn't going to therapy, and I realized he thought I meant he could read and self therapy for 5 minutes a day and not go to real sessions.

I explained why that's not what I meant and that I need him to stay on top of going to therapy regularly and he told me that it was unfair of me, that he isn't capable of it, and that we are breaking up if I require him to go to therapy.

He made it official by bringing his parents into it, and will be making the 12 hour drive with his family on Saturday to collect his things and car and then head home.

When I asked him why my safety and wellbeing were not important enough to him to seek help, he gave various reasons but also made sure to point out that I am ""lame and uninteresting"" in his eyes since I no longer do any recreational drugs, and that I too have changed since the beginning of our relationship and am no longer fun.

So I guess that's it. Not the update you all were probably hoping for. I'm honestly pretty hurt that me being sober is a bad thing in his mind rather than a good thing, despite the fact that it's led to me being damn good at my job and made it easier for me to help others.",relationship_advice

My husband (m, 26) got really angry with me a couple hours ago. I know he’s sexually frustrated or whatever because he’s used to having sex everynight but what he did just really scared me. And I know I haven’t been paying a lot of attention to him, and I promised him I would still, but I didn’t know the baby would need me this much.

My husband came home from work trying to have sex with me, and I told him “stop you know I can’t do this yet”. 

I’m in a lot of the pain and the doctor told me not to and he knows this. I’m also physically exhausted, I had a very long and difficult labor.

So he told me to “get on my knees”

I told him please I don’t feel like it.

And he told me “I provide for you, you do this for me”

I said no I don’t want to, and he slapped me. It was pretty hard enough to stun me.

I couldent believe he hit me it’s not like him at all. He’s never done that.

So then I just did what he wanted.

I don’t want to leave or anything crazy, he’s never done this and I have a baby to take care of and I can’t do that without him and his money. I feel very lost. I don’t know why he did this to me out of the blue. I know he’s my husband and I’m supposed to be intimate with him but I just can’t juggle everything all at once. I need help.

Initial post here 

So I posted here last time because I wasn't sure what to do, but y'all definitely helped me out a lot. I was overthinking it for sure, and I didn't really believe in myself. I had asked her if she was coming to the gym the next day through Instagram and she agreed, but she had an emergency and called it off. She did say she would make it up to me the day after, and well she did! We started our workout together and there has always been some tension between us, but it almost felt electric that night. I could definitely feel that something was in the air and well, she felt the same way! After the gym we talked for a few minutes until she got closer and kissed me! I was shocked but was able to go with the flow (still not a good kisser probably but meh), and she put my hands on her hips/ass basically lol. We made out for a little bit and when we finished we both just had a huge smile on our faces haha. Felt so surreal! We exchanged phone numbers and we did a kickboxing lesson together this weekend, which was loads of fun. Haven't laughed and felt this good in a long time. She invited me over to her place that night and we fooled around a little, definitely never expected it to go this fast. We've been texting a lot and still going to the gym everyday, and we're planning another fun activity this weekend. Still a bit unsure about some stuff because I'm inexperienced, but damn it's looking good.

I don't want to get attached too quickly, but seeing as it was building up to this moment for a long time we really, really like each other. She teases me about how I was so oblivious and that she started doubting if I was interested in her. In the end she took the initiative, but hey we're here now. I don't know what 'we' are at the moment. She has expressed she wants to be in a relationship with me and I'm game, but we haven't really discussed it yet. Anyways, thanks for the advice last time.

t3_choa7e,"My [22 F] boyfriend [30 M] is adamant I ""partially"" cheated due to a foot rub.","Background: I'm 22, boyfriend is 30. We've been dating for 6 months. My boyfriend is traditionally very attractive, but definitely has some insecurities and now I've started to notice, jealousy.  I'm a bit younger than my boyfriend and I sometimes feel a bit insecure on certain things due to the age difference.  
  

Setting: Last night, my boyfriend and I went to hang out with some friends of his at their house(a couple: M and F late 20's), that I hadn't met before. They aren't best of friends, but friends he sees once every few months or so. 
   

We were hanging out in their backyard, swimming, BBQing, drinking, over all we were having a really good time.  We ran out of mixer, so my boyfriend decided to run to the grocery store after a back and forth ""no, let me"" debate with his friend as my boyfriend is not really a drinker, and sober, he left for 30 mins or so.
   

I was talking to the girlfriend about common interests and we came upon the topic of injuries from sports. We both had cheered in highschool and were sharing injury stories. I mentioned the only thing that bothers me years later was my Achilles tendon on my left foot. If I do a lot of jumping, and walking it can get sore. Matter of fact, I could feel it right now, just from swimming.  
   

The girlfriend kind of stopped me in my tracks and said how amazing her boyfriend was at foot rubs, and he actually at one time was going to school for massage therapy. That ""I totally need to let him give me one"" and it would probably help. He kind of nodded his head and agreement and asked if I wanted one.  I had just met them and didn't feel entirely comfortable around them yet, so I declined.  She laughed and prodded ""oh come on"", so I said sure, kind of laughing at it.  
   

The boyfriend slid his chair over and I put my feet up on his thigh (right above the knee) and he started to rub my Achilles. All while, me and the girlfriend continued our conversation about injuries. She made a comment to her a boyfriend to ""do a good job!"" us both kind of laughing it off to him, and he moved from rubbing just the Achilles to kind of a full foot massage of both feet.  
   

Shortly thereafter my boyfriend came back in the midst of this rub, and I could see he was visibly angry. He remained calm but made a comment like ""thats enough of that"" and it ended and everyone kind of chuckled at it. We left shortly after because my boyfriends attitude had changed, and he kind of rushed us out awkwardly.  
   

I thought he was going to be excited how nice it all went, and that I was really personable with his friends. Nope. Not 10 seconds into the car, he instantly started berating me. He said ""I basically partially cheated on him"". I was blown away. He railed into a stance that getting a massage of any type, especially a foot massage is cheating if it's not in a professional setting. My boyfriend had an answer for literally every single thing I came up with in defense.   
  

I said it was the girlfriends idea and completely innocent. He said that he's sure his friend likely has a foot fetish, and I quote ""they have threesomes and were grooming you"".  
I said it was all about the Achilles injury. He asked why both of my feet were being rubbed.  
I said if it wasn't innocent, why didn't the 3 of us try to scramble and hide it? He asked why the offer for a rub happened while he was gone and not while he was there.  
   

He said that the age difference is why we have different point of views on this. That I'm 22 and still naive. That because of my age, there has been many times in the past couple months where I was oblivious people were making advances/hitting on me.  When prodded, he wouldn't give me any examples.  
   

Now that I'm sober and looking back at it. I don't know if the foot fetish or threesome thing is fact, or my boyfriend just being ridiculous, making shit up to defend his stance. Even though I felt like it was innocent, I'm starting to doubt my thoughts on it. I'm not sure if it was innocent in his friends/the girlfriend's view.
  

We haven't talked about this in depth yet, I woke up and am posting this first thing today after he dropped me off last night.

t3_chhijg,"I, M24 was just informed I may not be able to produce sperm anymore due chlamydia that my current gf F21 gave me","Said female and I have been dating for about a 9months and I noticed some strange sensation around pelvic region.  I went to doctor for some testicular pain and he took a swab of the area and inside penis. Results came back and it turned out I had chlamydia. I spoke with said gf about the results and asked if she had ever been tested because I had prior to being with her and everything was negative. She said ,”no I haven’t”. But, I’ve only been with one other guy (this other guy was a huge piece of shit and cheated on her a lot ). &amp; I told her , just because you hadn’t been with a lot of guys doesn’t mean he hasn’t been with many females. She agreed, and got tested. Results were positive and she felt bad for passing the disease to me. 

I told her it was no bid deal, there’s a cure, everything is ok. It happens. During all of this the doc is paying attention to my claim about testicular pain and  went ahead and scheduled me for an ultrasound anyway. 

I go ahead with the radiology appointment  and I get a call from him saying there were abnormalities present in the test and to come in asap. I get to his office today and he begins to tell me about irritated vessels &amp; inflammation. Then he leads into how he’s going to schedule another ultra sound in a couple of weeks to see if I’m producing sperm. Because it’s possible that the chlamydia has been in my system since we started dating 9 months ago. 

I was obviously taken back by this and started to freak out a bit. But,  he tried to keep me positive. I don’t have any children, but of course I want to some day. I told my gf when she got off work about what happened and her response was so bland. She didn’t show any concern or sympathy about the situation. She just said,”well, all we can do is wait and see.”  I understand that I may be having a pre-mature freak out, but not even a simply apology for making me go through this? 

She’s in a different room right now and I want to talk about it, but I don’t want to come off as aggressive and start an argument. Should I just ignore it all and wait till the second test? What should I do?",relationship_advice
t3_chnchv,My (27) boyfriend (31) ruined my birthday,"Throwaway as my friends and bf know my account. 

&amp;#x200B;

My bf and I have been together for over 4 years in what I would think is a healthy relationship. We rarely argue and talk through things rationally and calmly. However, the one consistent thing that has bothered me is his drinking. When we are together, we drink moderately and enjoy our drinks. But, when he is out with coworkers or we all go out as friends, he can't control himself. He gets very drunk very easily and ends up turning into a different person. He is easily combative, highly emotional, and can turn at any second. He has upset me with this on numerous occasions and whenever I brought it up the next day, he would hardly remember what happened the previous night. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other night my parents brought us out for my birthday to a nice restaurant I've been looking forward to going to for months. The same day, my bf had his summer party with coworkers and promised me he would be home early and wouldn't drink much. Instead, he shows up drunk to dinner and ruined the entire mood. He was so handsy, lounging in the booth with his legs up, hair messy, eyes droopy, and yelling at me at certain occasions for now apparent reason. My parents asked me if everything was okay and mentioned that he seemed very emotional, but I told them I'd talk to them about it later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once we left dinner, he kept getting more and more upset, yelling, banging walls for no reason, and ended up getting home before me as he decided to walk very fast. I ignored him as I came home, went to get ready for bed, and found him passed out on the couch. When I got ready for work the next morning, I left without saying goodbye which I never do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering an ultimatum: either stop drinking so much with your coworkers (or potentially stop drinking at all) or we break up. I love him, but the amount of times we have had the same issue come up has been too much for me. My friends and family think we should break up, but I know it will hurt so much to lose him. My question is, what is the best course of action here? What do you do when your partner has a drinking problem socially or do not know how to handle themselves in these situations?",relationship_advice
t3_chgokf,My husband is a contractor... and I just realized he is awful at it... but not before he took on building our house which has taken him 4 years to do. He knowingly manipulated me into believing everything was done correctly. Now the house is built and everything looks laughably horrible.,"Where do I begin. I have been married for 10 years with my husband. He is a contractor. We are both in our 30’s.

Our first year of marriage he got “screwed” on a huge job and to be honest, and it REALLY put us behind in life (at least where we wanted to be). We were hoping to use the money to buy our first starter house and long story short. It never happened. He reassured me the reason he was screwed was because the home owner was a scammer not because he was not able to deliver good craftsmanship. Of course i took him at his word.

We lived in a rented home for a few years and during this time he went into a bad depression where didn’t work, didn’t help around the house, didn’t move from the sofa, didn’t cook, and treated me very poorly. Meanwhile I worked two jobs to keep us afloat. This went on for about a year. One day I hit a breaking point, told him I was leaving. That day he went back to work, we got counseling, everything has been ok.

After we put this behind us, We wanted to build our first home so we moved into his parents house to save. Now we have lived with his parents most of the time we’ve been married. 

3 years ago we finally saved up enough money to build our own home. We went the self build route because “obviously” my husband is perfectly capable of spearheading this project. After all he has been in construction all his life. This would allow us to have enough equity on the home to double our money once sold.

The jobs I have seen him do turn out great. This is why I don’t understand what went wrong.

I am a designer by trade so I designed the home and he built it.

Over the years I have seen him deal with people who weren’t happy with their jobs, and I never thought anything if it. I just always assumed it was common for this industry.

Well. That was until my husband built our house.  The craftsmanship of the finished work is absolutely laughable. Beyond bad. Trim needs totally redone, ALL the tile needs ripped out, fireplace needs re-done. House needs completely repainted. I mean it is beyond bad. And when I would point it out and was open, he would gas light me and tell me I was insane and “that’s what it’s supposed to look like”.... i don’t know a lot about construction but I’ve never seen tile with half inch grout lines on one end and 1mm on another. It’s absolutely embarrassing.

The other part is this, he has taken 3 years to build this home because he refuses to stop working his full-time job or take a break. Even though I make enough money for him to take a break and focus sorely on the house. Which I begged him to do but he refused. 

I have gotten to a point where I can’t even enter the house without feeling complete anger because I KNOW this is not what homes look like. I know he’s totally full of it. But he has been making me question my sanity. My expectations aren’t high. I have been VERY patient. Everything is “not a big deal” or not “done” yet, until it is, and it looks the same. He’s been telling me that this is “how everyone” does houses.

I finally hit another breaking point today. And he FINALLY he admitted to me that he was burned out and just didn’t care. He did a poor job because it was ours basically, and for whatever reason he through he could manipulate me into believing that his horrible craftsmanship is “standard”. 

I’ve sacrificed a lot to have this home. We both saved a lot of money. We lived in SUPER uncomfortable living situations for years. I put off having kids. We basically spent all my 20’s working to the bone. Just for him to just not care?

And now I just feel super strung along and manipulated. And I’m honestly just at a loss on what to do. 

He does not want anyone to come in to fix anything... Because it would “cost a lot more” but (honestly I think because he is partly embarrassed/ and partly doesn’t want to be caught in more lies).... And wants to continue working on what is our FOURTH year into building this house, which is another year of putting off kids, not being able to invest into our futures, and another year of looking at this nightmare... This is not a HUGE home by the way. 2400sq. 

I feel like I’m living a nightmare. I just feel very let down, lied to, betrayed, confused. I feel like he doesn’t even comprehend how any of this could make me feel this way. Like...How many years of our lives have been wasted? And the whole gas lighting thing has left me drained. I can’t even look at him. 

I feel like i am so upset that I could honestly divorce him, walk away and never look back. Part of me feels shallow and that I’m not “upholding” the wedding vows i made. My question to you all is honestly, what would you do in my situation? In terms of my relationship AND this home?",relationship_advice

I called her and she said ""mom's not on the plane, she's going to europe"" to which I told her she was joking. she said she wasn't and she was right. an hour later i get a call from my wife, call lasts less than a minute...""I'm in love with someone and i'm going to *europe* for the rest of the summer"" is what she tells me.

my gut tells me this marriage is broken beyond repair (duh) and i should probably consult an attorney...but another part of me is holding onto the thought that my kids deserve to have two parents that stay together through thick and thin and i should see a therapist.  maybe i need to do both?  should i tell the kids exactly what my wife told me two weeks ago?  i'm just trying to keep busy in the meantime and not dwell on this to distraction.",relationship_advice

t3_chmbbr,[30/m] My [older/mf] relatives bought our dream house and didn't tell us until it was under contract,"Two years ago, a gentleman down the street from my parents in this nice neighborhood passed away. His son-in-law was in charge of the estate. We loved the house and we asked him about it. We talked for a while and he showed us around, we still loved the house. He said he wasn't ready to sell it yet and probably wouldn't be for some time as they live far away but said he'd keep us in mind before he put it on the market. That was fine with us since the $120,000 that it was evaluated at was a little bit out of our price range.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last 2 years, my fiancee has gone out of her way to drive past the house every few weeks and make sure it's not falling apart and talk about what she wants to do with it. My 6 year old son knows which room will be his. When we first talked to the guy about the house, we were really excited and told my family.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of that family was my aunt and uncle who have always been some of my idols. I didn't have the most stable early childhood but what was always constant was thanksgivings at their house and the love and warmth that came from it. It's always been my favorite holiday because of this. Well, 2-3 weeks ago we get a text from my Mom asking if we still had the contact number for the owner of the house because my aunt and uncle want to look at it. We asked them to look at other houses because they've got a lot of money and there's no way we could win a bidding war against them.

&amp;#x200B;

They said it was no problem, they didn't realize we were still interested, and they'd look elsewhere. We said that we'd call Monday the 22nd (now this past monday) to find out how low the owner would be willing to go because if it was still out of our price range then they'd be welcome to it. Well, Monday rolls around and my aunt and uncle text us saying ""I know you're not going to like to hear this, but we've done extensive research on the houses in the area and we are going to buy that house.""

We were heartbroken and my fiancee decided to go down and meet with the owners to ask if they'd still consider a bid from us. They said they absolutely would because they remembered that we were asking so long ago but said unfortunately they had just signed a contract and if we would've asked last week they definitely would've worked with us and the price they bought it for was well within our price range.

&amp;#x200B;

What hurts is that these people meant a lot to me. Not only did they lie when they said they wouldn't pursue the house, but they made sure they waited to tell us until they had it locked in. It feels like they just wanted to make sure we couldn't get in the way. I'm honestly at a loss of what to do. Thanksgiving is definitely out of the question at least until they move because even if our relationship can get past this, there's no way we could go into that house and enjoy it as someone else's. My fiancee sent a somewhat emotional text that I think she knew wasn't a good idea but she was having trouble holding it in - it wasn't super nasty but it certainly wasn't friendly.My parents said they'd follow our lead on this as far as Thanksgiving goes but they don't want to be pulled into the middle of the conflict - they'll be passive supporters - but they aren't thrilled about that text message either. As far as my response, I really don't know what to do. I'm trying to decide if I should go down and explain to them the personal hurt and try to understand why they did this or if it's better off just cutting them out and moving on - maybe they're not the people I've always thought they were.  I appreciate any outside perspective on this, thank you.",relationship_advice
t3_chn3nr,Update from yesterday - I can't talk to my husband without him getting mad,"Link to previous post here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ch7lpp/i_dont_know_how_to_talk_to_my_husband_without/?utm_source=reddit-android

Well.. let's just say it didn't turn out well.

My husband got home from work. We talked about his day, he took a shower, and he sat down on the couch. Everything was good. When he sat down, I said I needed to talk to him about something. As soon as I said that he rolled his eyes and said ""Alright go ahead, I thought I was gonna have a good night but go ahead and fuck it up."" I calmly explained I wasn't trying to do that, that I just wanted to have a conversation. I told him how I felt that we need to move and downsize so that we could get out of the financial hole we were in. He started screaming at me and yelling. I continued to try to talk to him calmly. He said ""Who put you up to this?"" (I said in my previous post his mother and grandfather have noticed we are struggling and have talked to him &amp; I wish they wouldn't have because I knew he would react this way) I explained that they did not put me up to it and I had not talked to them about it, but I knew they had talked to him. I said that I haven't said anything because I was waiting to talk to him on my own and that I had been nervous. I explained that I was nervous about our financial situation and if we didn't something, it was going to get worse. He started to laugh and said ""Don't make me say something to hurt your feelings"". And I didn't say anything and he continued to make that statement. He eventually said ""Yeah, I just think it's real fucking funny you didn't care about our fucking finances when I was making more money than you"". Which isn't true at all, our financial situation has never been like this. After he said that he continues by saying, ""I will fucking quit my dream job before I fucking move and it will be all because of you"". Last July, he quit his peevious job for his dream job and took a major pay cut. He continued to cuss at me and call me names. I just looked at him. I stayed calm somehow the entire time, but I finally got off the couch, turned, looked at him and said, ""What is wrong with you?"" He then told me to ""Get the fuck out of his house"" repeatedly. Nothing like this has ever happened before. So I quickly grabbed some stuff without saying a word and as I walked out the door, he said ""Yeah, leave like I always knew you would"". I stayed gone for like an hour, came home, and he was watching a movie on the couch like nothing happened. I tried to talk to him and he ignored me. I tried to talk to him again and he ignored me. I said ""Do you just want me to go to bed?"" And he said ""Do whatever"". So I went to bed and laid there sick on my stomach all night and he slept on the couch. Someone please give some kind of advice. I don't even know where to go from here.",relationship_advice
t3_chou2e,"How one classic book helped me find my true love (thanks to A Gentleman in Moscow) (Me 24 M and Me (M, 25)"," Now I really don’t believe in fairy tales, but I must say that the past month has been nothing short of one. I think when things want to happen your way, the entire Universe conspires to make it happen. So when a colleague I have hardly talked to since I joined my new company gifted me a book on my birthday, things started rolling.

I am not a big fan of novels. So when “A Gentleman in Moscow” was gifted to me, I was least expecting to read it. But one fateful night, I was too tired to go out and too bored to watch a movie. So I started reading the book instead and I was instantly hooked to the story. I finished it within the next few hours and I cant remember when I dozed off. The next morning, the only thing I wanted to do was visit Russia. Sounds crazy?

I worked hard and deservedly got a week’s worth of vacation time. I booked the tour at Hotel Metropol. The day I reached the place and entered through its magnificent doors was one of the best days of my life. After checking in, I visited all the places the Count frequented. I also got a veal tongue for lunch. In the evening I visited the Chaliapin Bar to get a taste of the Count’s favorite drink. And there I met him.

He, too, was on the tour and we started talking fervently about the book and our experiences after reading the story. He was witty and he found me funny. We had a great time together and before we knew, we were falling head over heels for each other. That was the best one week of my entire life. We arrived back to the States and although we are from different cities, we have met a few times and I plan to move in with him. Well, I found the love of my life. And its all thanks to “A Gentleman in Moscow.”",relationship_advice
t3_chneur,She was trying to make me a back up option and I admitted I’d fallen for her,"I think I screwed up. She was obviously trying to make me her back up option. We had been sleeping together and dating and then all this crappy stuff happened like her ghosting me and calling me obsessed and now suddenly she wants to be my friend? No, I’m not playing that game. I’d played one too many games with her already. 

She asked me why she didn’t follow me on social media anymore. I thought I’d just be honest and say what I felt. Which was I’d fallen for her hard even though it hadn’t been that long and her liking my insta posts while simultaneously ghosting me was super confusing and I had to delete her. id stood my ground and played it so well up to then. 

I know I shouldn’t want a girl who disrespects me enough to try turn me into a back up option. But I really do and I think I screwed up by saying this. I fed her ego and she probably thinks I’m a complete wet towel now. 

I dunno, any thoughts? I feel really down about myself and I don’t understand why I was only good enough to be a plan b",relationship_advice
t3_chjak4,How do I get over resenting my ex wife’s new man?,"My ex wife is a high school teacher and during a difficult time in our marriage she hooked up with one of her students (he was 18 at the time). They recently got married (she’s 46 and he’s 22). We have four kids together and we share joint custody, but I’m struggling.

Even though she’s the one that cheated, I feel like I wasn’t good enough for her. I feel like I let my physical appearance get too bad and she kicked me to the curb for this young hotshot. It makes me sick knowing that he’s raising my kids and to make matters worse, she’s pregnant with his daughter now. 

I never thought I’d be a lonely divorcee, let alone be replaced by some kid. I obviously hold resentment towards my wife, but I would say I have more anger towards him. I feel as if he ‘stole’ my life, my wife, my kids, ect.

Last night, I heard my 8 year old refer to him as her ‘daddy’. That was the last straw for me. As if it wasn’t bad enough that he has taken over my family, now he has my kids referring to him as MY title.

I have never really confronted him, though I’ve talked to my wife about some of my concerns about a 22 year old man raising 4 kids ranging from the ages of 6-16 AND a pregnant wife. It concerns me, but more importantly, it devastates me!

How can I stop feeling sorry for myself and not feel so much anger and resentment towards this kid? Do I talk it out with him? Do I talk to the kids? I just need some peace and closure. My health has slowly declined ever since all of this and I bottle up all my feelings around my friends &amp; family.",relationship_advice
t3_chh11b,"my brother (18m) is doing concerning, inappropriate sexual behavior that I (24f) worry could lead to a serious offense. Help?","Throwaway. On mobile too.

My brothers not a bad kid generally, Idk if this is important but he was adopted as a toddler. We had a generally positive normal relationship through childhood. 

When I was 19-20 (him 13-14). I’d come home from school for breaks or the summer and I noticed my bras and panties were going missing. Some of them would show up in my hamper a week or two later, and eventually I found a pair of my tights in there with,well, a dick hole cut out. He was clearly stealing my panties.

My parents never talked to us about anything sexual so when I brought this up they “solved the problem” by giving me a doorknob I could lock from the outside with a key as I left, and insisted “it was one of his friends. We’re sure” ugh! My mom sayyyyys she talked to him but I doubt it was a convo of much substance.

Well, now years later I’ve just been told that my brothers recent ex gf went to the police and is accusing him of assault. I don’t know exactly what happened but some of it involved him pinning her down and I guess he really scared her. My parents are saying she’s exaggerating bc he dumped her and I’m over here like no! This is concerning! Her family is hiring a private investigator or something to look into things, I guess it’s serious but no one will give me details. 

 I worry that if no one does anything it won’t stop there. The panties thing really violated my boundaries and personal trust towards him. &amp; why the hell would a teenage girl go to the cops like this all terrified if nothing happened?

Is there anything that can be done?

t3_chpc8t,Wife is getting really close with my best friend when they previously had no relationship beforehand and it has me worried.,"I'll try and give as much details as possible and I do want to say upfront that I really do trust my wife and haven't said a word to her about any of this because of that. It is getting increasingly worrisome once one of my wife's friends pointed it out to me.

I am 23(M) and she is 24(F) and we live in the US. My friend is 24(M) 

Some backstory here, I have been married to my wife for a little over a year and together for 3 years. She is incredible and we have had practically 0 relationship issues.

My best friend has been my best friend since I was two years old. We are inseparable and extremely close. He just graduated college and moved back to our town and my wife helped him out by getting him a job at her work (Insurance Company) as a financial adviser. They have never been friends before this and just talked because I'm obviously very close with both of them so they would interact while I was with both of them.

He got the job 4 months ago. Since the day he started the following things have started happening.

1. They text all the time. I see it at a glance but never really go through them, but they never once texted before. It isn't that weird considering they work together now but the volume is a lot.
2. He doesn't respond to me anymore. If I message him on Facebook or text him, he reads it and doesn't respond or if he does its 3-4 days later and he says he has just been really busy.
3. He insists on picking my wife up for their weekly office meetings and telling her how cool they look arriving in his sports car.
4. I get home from work and he has been there multiple times. Nothing weird happening, but he is just there watching TV and hanging out with her or doing whatever. He acts normal when I come in and acts like my buddy.
5. He gets licences to start working effectively and he doesn't tell me he passed his tests at all and he goes to dinner with my wife to celebrate. No invitation for me and I found out like 2 weeks later.
6. They go to Seattle every year for a big work conference and are now going together. They aren't sharing a room together but have made it clear they will be spending the whole time together and are going to an amusement park and stuff just them.
7. He made my wife switch gyms to go to his and they go nearly every day when before she went 2-3 times a week
8. He comments on all her pictures now going cuuuuuutttteeeeeee or something like that.

Am I insane? There are other small stuff I don't need to list out like how they talk sometimes. Am I being paranoid here? I haven't said a word to either of them except one quick snide comment to my wife as sort of a joke and she just brushed it off saying ""Oh yeah its cause we work together and you guys are best friends anyways"".

As I said before my wife's best friend pointed this out to me when I was only barely paying attention to it before at a house party we had last week and I started to realize it a little more.

A lot of it could be my insecurity. I'm not afraid to admit he is better looking than me and in really good shape. He has said before (like guys do sometimes) when we got together that my girlfriend was hot.

What do I do here? Any advice would be great.

t3_chje1d,I (24f) went on a BAD date this morning. I blocked him (24m) afterwards but I can’t stop thinking about it. How can I move on??,"So, as I said, I went on a date this morning. It was with a guy I met on tinder. From the get-go our conversation felt a little weird, with him messaging me every few hours even if I didn’t message back, asking to call me or send him snaps, etc. I arranged a date with him before these behaviors became apparent.

Our date was for coffee at 8:30 this morning. Right from the start, it was clear he was more into it than I was - he kissed me on the lips right when we met, and didn’t let go of my hand for the half hour we were in the coffee shop. After that, he suggested that we “go for a walk” (in a strip mall??) and when we were outside suggested we sit in his car. I didn’t want to make him upset, so I agreed. 

When we were sitting in his car, he kept kissing me. I told him 3 times I didn’t want to kiss, but he was insisting that I was “extending my lips” and that I wanted to anyways. Finally, he took the hint and stopped trying to kiss my lips, but kept kissing my cheek, my neck, etc. he kept touching me despite me saying I didn’t want him to. He was, overall, way too close to me and touching me way too much despite me saying verbally and with body language that I didn’t want him to do this. 

I left at 9:30, went home, and blocked him on everything. I felt gross that he ignored my boundaries and my physical/verbal cues. It’s now 1 am, and I still can’t stop thinking about it. I feel horrible and gross and so anxious. How do I move on from this? Has anyone else experienced this?

t3_chahvz,Roommate [M21] is uncomfortable with me [M21] having sex in my room,"I share an apartment with my roommate, who rarely ever leaves. Lately he has been getting annoyed that when my girlfriend comes over, he can hear us having sex (the walls are thin and not soundproof, but I turn a loud fan on).  We try to be as quiet as we can, but he has told me he can even hear our quiet conversations. The other day, he said we should give him notice before so he can go to the gym- but when I have done this, he takes 30-40 minutes to get ready to leave and is only gone another 30-40 minutes. On one hand, I appreciate him leaving to give us space but it’s a little strange to me that we have a designated “window”. My question is, does anyone have advice for meeting my roommates request? My girlfriend and I have sex maybe a couple times during the week max if that matters, I don’t think it’s an unusual amount.

(Edited to fix some typos)

Update: So I talked to my roommate and I wish it had been easily resolved but it was a little complicated. I forgot to mention my roommate also has an atypical sleeping situation- it is not consistent and he is basically nocturnal. He sleeps sporadically during the day and stays up at night (1am-8am). I brought up the situation, apologized and said I would do my best to keep sex within the times that he is gone but that we will have to compromise since it’s unreasonable to expect me to have sex on a schedule. I brought up headphones- he says the problem is that he is in bed trying to fall asleep usually when he hears us so he doesn’t want to put headphones in (this is during the day, anywhere from noon to 9 pm) I offered those foam earplugs, it was a no. He already had noise cancelling headphones that he will use if he is awake and hears us, and not taking a nap. It basically ended with me saying I will give him a heads up before, and he can leave or listen to music. He still wants me to refrain from having sex if he is trying to fall asleep. Im going to say this is resolved, and I’m being as considerate as I can. If this comes up again, I’m going to say it’s his problem not mine.",relationship_advice
t3_chjzv6,I (18F) think my boyfriend (19M) raped me. I don’t really know what to do in case I’m pregnant,"Sorry if im being confusing. My mind is all over the place right now 

 I always told my boyfriend that we can’t have sex because I’m not sure yet and he gets annoyed but he takes care of it after or he’ll finish while we’re kissing. but he never really pressured me. 

He lives with some of his friends and we were hanging out. They were playing basketball then we went back to his apartment and they were playing on their play station. I was in his bedroom on my phone and I was gonna fall asleep and I do that sometimes so usually I sleep over if I’m too tired. We sleep in the same bed with no problems like he doesn’t get bothered or extra horny, like he’s fine. So I was there and they were in the living room and I could hear them since the apartments so small and somehow they started talking about me and they were just making fun that he’s so whipped for me and I won’t even put out and he’s not a man. It was stupid like dumb guy talk. They’re like 12 yr olds like oh you’re so gay bro this and that. Idiots. He just laughed it off and didn’t really say anything so I thought that he’s so smart and mature and doesn’t care what they think. I guess they’re annoying guys and say that stuff a lot, they’re that type. 

Yeah it actually did get to him because he came to bed after they were done playing and he woke me up and started touching me really aggressively and being inappropriate. I asked him what he was doing and he was so mad and he told me that I need to relax and stop talking. I don’t really know if I can get into detail like maybe this post would be removed but basically he held me down and had sex with me. He didnt even have a condom and I kept asking him to please stop and he promised to buy me a pill. I did tell him to stop, I kept asking him and I started crying too. But I don’t know, he’s like really tall, the lights were off idk he was like putting his whole body on me so I couldn’t even move at all. it was so scary and he didn’t even care he covered my mouth because I was being too loud. This is so disgusting but when he “finished” he started kissing me and said he loved me so much, like he was trying to be sweet or something 

We went to the store afterwards and he seemed awkward and said he was really sorry he finished fast but hoped I had some fun. He bought me a pill and some other stuff too. Like pantiliners and condoms and a couple pregnancy tests and fucking candy to cheer me up. In his car he said he was so stupid for not wearing a condom and he started crying 

I feel so embarrassed. His roommates probably heard everything like me crying and asking him to stop. They both left early in the morning so they didn’t have to see us and we always hang out together in the morning and eat breakfast together and stuff. They definitely heard us. 

I don’t know. I think he felt pressured by his friends. But he didn’t have to do that to me. And anyway what am I supposed to do if I am pregnant. This is such a mess and I don’t feel good, he hurt me and the pill he made me take feels like hell. I feel like I have insane period cramps and my mom doesn’t know and I just told her I’m sick. 

I’d be so embarrassed if I’m pregnant. I’m only 18. My life would be over. I can’t believe he did this to me either like I really loved him idk He was so nice and never pressured me or was rude and he just went from 0 to 100. Like I always felt comfortable enough to sleep over with him and he never tried to touch me or start anything. And he just all of a sudden forced himself on me, it was like another person like it wasn’t him. He was just ignoring me when I asked him to stop as if he couldn’t hear me. God I don’t know. I hate my life right now. I wish I could rewind and go back in time or something. He came over and took care of me and made me soup since I told him I don’t feel good and he’s acting really nice. Like giving me massages and watching my movies with me even though he hates them and rubbing my stomach and making tea for me.

She got attached pretty quickly, and before long, she wanted to talk everyday (sometimes multiple times a day.) She said I love you early (maybe a month.) She also started talking about our future pretty quickly. And not just ""let's become exclusive"" future, but full on ""I can't wait to marry you"" future.  

&amp;#x200B;

It was too much too early for me, so I asked for some space. Well, that morphed into a bit of a fight. She accused me of having trust issues (guilty as charged). She also said I should stop leading her on if I don't want something serious. The fight got worse, and after she said something particularly unkind to me, I lost my temper. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's when I did it: I asked her what kind of mother is certain she wants to marry and build a life with someone she's only known for a few months. ""You're just getting to know me. I could be a child molester."" (AM NOT CHILD MOLESTER) 

&amp;#x200B;

This is definitely the most below the belt thing I've ever said to a romantic partner, and I am very sorry for it. After cooling down, I called her to apologize, but she's not speaking to me.

t3_chp7tw,Best friend (24f) mad at me (25f) for not supporting her staying with her cheating bf (25m),"So this just happened last week and I am at a loss of what to do and if I am handling the situation like an asshole. Also, this is a long set up so please bear with me

Background information:

Me and my best friend live together with a third friend, and this is the third year of our lease. My best friend (Molly) has been dating this guy (John) for about a year now, and he has been living in our apartment since basically the start of their relationship (while leasing his own place in the next town over). John is really friendly to everyone and has a very loud personality. He is also one of those people who doesn’t have a filter, so he often says inappropriate things. For example, a couple weeks ago our other roommate enters the kitchen while us three were in there and he tells her that her shirt makes her boobs look big. Other comments he has made (while in my and my best friends presence) includes many remarks on other women’s bodies and clothes, comments on his ex girlfriends bodies (“her tits were huge”, “she could really suck some dick”), etc. 

In the beginning of their relationship he also behaved in questionable ways, such as standing Molly up for dates they had planned a long time in advance, being no call/ no show to plans with our group of friends, conveniently ‘forgetting’ to charge his phone while going out without her or going away with his guy friends, the list goes on. 

Furthermore, John only just got a job and had previously refused to do so, letting Molly pay for everything. His parents pay his rent and bills, but had taken away the car they bought him last year because of his refusal to work. Molly will often lend him her car for days on end, and he will even tell her she can’t have it back when she asks for it because he needs it. To me, these things are all huge red flags and I would occasionally try to talk to Molly about them but she denies there is anything wrong. At best, she will get mad at him for a day or two and then things will go back to normal. Molly also has severe anxiety, which I believe is the reason she will not end things with John. However, they have even fought about her mental issues, with John saying Molly is acting too “sad and annoying” when she is in a depressive or anxiety ridden state. On two occasions that I know of, he has left our house stomping and yelling at Molly while she cried in bed, saying he can’t stand being around her while she was “like this”. Despite all this Molly insists they are perfect together and in love, and we (all the people in the apartment) and our friend group were relatively close friends as it seemed like we could only hangout with her if he was around too. 

The Event:


These points are the basis of their relationship, however there of course are all the ‘good’ times and dates and other stuff I am not privy too as well. Cut to this weekend: I am bathing the dog when I hear crying and screaming. Molly runs down stairs bawling her eyes out holding Johns phone, which he had left to charge while going to his new job. Apparently Molly had been getting suspicious of John because he would constantly text another girls name who he claimed he was just friends with from college. So when he left she went to read the texts and saw that they have been VERY flirty, with John calling the girl baby, sexy, sweet heart, etc. and offering to “send pics”, saying “I’ll call you later/ let’s face time later”, “I can’t wait to see you”/“I miss you” etc. Molly said that they had been texting throughout Molly and Johns whole relationship, but he would call her crazy or say her anxiety and paranoia were acting up again when she called him out on it. He would constantly change his phone password when ever she found out his old one, and he would always try to steer her away from using his phone. 

Of course, Molly was EXTREMELY upset, shaking crying and ranting about John and how men suck etc. She called a couple of our mutual friends and Johns brother asking if they knew the girl and saying how John has been cheating on her. This continued for several hours until John got ‘home’ from work, or gets to our apartment I should say. As soon as John gets in the door Molly shows him the texts and accuses him of cheating on her. They go to Molly’s room and I hear screaming for maybe close to 45 minutes, but I move to the basement to give her privacy. Our other roommate was gone for the weekend so she was not there at all. Eventually I go upstairs to use the restroom but it is very quiet so I assume he left. I knock on her door to ask if she’s okay and if she needs anything, and John answers and says “Go away”.  Immediately I am annoyed that he was still there and he would tell me to go away in my own place after what he just did. I say “Molly are you okay?” And she responds that she is and she will text me later. I go to my boyfriends house for dinner and later on we return to my place to watch a movie. When we walk in (at this point several hours later) we find Molly and John cuddling on the couch. 

John greets us and asks if we wanted to watch Netflix with them. I said no and go to the kitchen, with my boyfriend following me. Molly walks in and I give her a look that says “what the fuck” and she tells me they talked it out and they’re all good. Before I could say anything other than”wow”, John walks in and tries to start a conversation. I do not respond to him and my boyfriend is uncomfortable and leaves to use the restroom (classic). Molly then mentions my party the following weekend (which her and our roommate were throwing for me in honor of a recent promotion), and John says how fun it will be. I tell him that I would be more comfortable if he did not come, and he asks me why. I say that I no longer wished to be his friend, and he looks at Molly and says okay and walks out of the room. 

The next two days, John and Molly plan a beach trip for the weekend with our friend group but do not include me. She had also been avoiding seeing me or talking to me, and our other roommate says I am being an asshole. I feel as though I am losing my best friend, but I don’t think it is my place to push her into ending the relationship. I’ve reached out asking if she wanted to talk about what happened and she did not answer me. Also, truth be told I am tired of doing damage control on her relationship crises just for her to ignore advice and all other red flags and continue to be with her bf. I think he is toxic but I am at a loss for what to do. Also, I am pissed at our mutual friends who I feel like are supporting their relationship even though they know what happened.",relationship_advice
t3_chnhv0,My Boss (20M) asked me (22f) to leave my job for him so I did and now he ghosted me. What do I do?,"A little background. I initiated this by asking him out to drinks a few weeks back. He replied that it was kind and he felt flattered but because he is above me at work, he really shouldn’t hang out with me while he is my boss. A few hours later he texts me telling me that he wants to meet up and talk. So we end up walking around and talking for about 4 hours from life stories to our darkest secrets. It felt intimate and special like a friend you’ve known for a long time. I really felt secure with him and comfortable in what was going on. He then asked to sit in my car before I left and he ended up making out with me for over an hour. He then asked to have sex but I couldn’t because time of month. He totally respected that. He then grabbed my hands and held them and told me he felt something real and raw with us and that he wanted to try a relationship with me because it seemed right. 
So the next night he texts me again and asks me to hang out. I agree and we set up a movie date. The date goes amazing he’s kissing me through the whole movie and making me feel on top of the world. And then when we get into his car to leave he tells me I can’t keep seeing you if you’re working under me. Once you quit let’s try this for real. We make out and I leave. So I quit. I left my job and have a better new one set up for a few weeks from now. It’s a huge risk but I thought a good guy would be worth it. So I finish up my last day at my current job and text him to see if he wants to hang out and get no reply. I sent him a Snapchat and he hasn’t even opened it. So now I’m debating what do I do?

All my friends have told me that no reply is still a reply. And they think he’s a 6 and I’m a 9 so I’m wasting my time on a guy they think isn’t worth my time. But I feel like I want more closure than just getting ghosted. I want to text him and ask “I don’t mean to bother you but if you’re not interested in me can you just let me know instead of ghosting me like we never even met”.

Everyone of my friends says don’t text him but I feel that I deserve some insight as to what happened. I legit quit my job to try and date this guy and he does the worst thing possible.

Do I text him? Do I let it go?
I know I’m an idiot for leaving my job for a guy please don’t tell me that in the comments. I know I f***** up.",relationship_advice
t3_chhpw7,My husband just bought a really expensive sex doll and it’s really getting to me,"I’ve been married to my husband for 7 years now. I’m a 29F and he’s a 32M. For a few months to a year now, I’ve been saying no to sex a lot. I’ve just not been in the mood but his libido has been at the same sky high levels that they’ve been since we were college kids. 

Some days when I’m in bed tired he starts touching me, trying to get me primed for sex. Most times I’m not in the mood, but some times I cave in to his begging. I felt as his wife it was my duty. But I never enjoyed any of those sex sessions.

So I made my feelings known to him. At first he seemed really down but he said he respected my decision. He stopped asking me for sex after that. Even when he asked, after I said no he would just roll over and go to bed.

After a month or two, he suddenly came him with a sex doll. It was a really expensive one, with huge tits and a round ass with very human like skin. When I confronted him about it he said he had sexual needs and since I couldn’t satisfy them he had to find a way to satisfy himself without cheating.

When he said that I felt like I couldn’t say anything. It made me feel really insecure, and I suddenly feel really awful. I can’t tell him to get rid of it because it’ll make me look really selfish. I also can’t complain about how expensive t was because we’re pretty well off. 

I noticed one night that I was in the mood but he told me he was tired. He had had a few rounds with the sex doll before I got home and was pooped out. I don’t know what to do at this point, but I knew I feel awful.",relationship_advice
t3_chnsim,Insecure needy man,"I've been seeing a man for about a month now and I'm crazy about him. The problem is, he's been really mistreated by women in the past and is highly insecure. Every time we've had sex he over analyzes and he gets very insecure and says that my reactions during sex make him think he's inadequate. I'm not a super vocal person, but I'm definitely not quiet or unresponsive when we sleep together.
 I've never, ever dealt with such bad insecurity, and I'd like to help him threw it, but when I do compliment him he wont accept it or believe it most of the time, which is frustrating and stressful. I am in no way going to throw in the towel, I just really want to know what to say and how to help him threw this insecurity so that he can feel my sincerity and how I feel about him.

I have my own insecurities and fears, I fear that if I come on too strong, tell him that I feel like I'm falling for him that it'll scare him away, but at the same time I don't want to hold back and lose him because I don't express myself enough.",relationship_advice
t3_chd3km,"Today is my 1st anniversary, I want a divorce","This is more of a rant than advice needed. I know what I need to do, it’s pulling the trigger. Throwaway account obviously.

tl:dr: I’m going through a bunch of shit right now. New husband has sat on his ass and not helped. Today is our anniversary but I don’t want to celebrate, I want a fucking divorce!



As the title states, today is my first anniversary. It will be my last. My husband and I eloped last year after dating for five years.  We eloped because he couldn’t be assed to make a real plan, and cancelled two prior weddings.  (yeah, I know)

My family can’t stand him. All except my daughter from a previous relationship, who’s 10. She loves him and he is good with her. They play and he helps with homework, gives advice, goes to school events, etc.

That said, my husband has never moved in! He technically lives in his own home that he owns but spends every night in the home I own.This allows him to escape all responsibility for cleaning, paying bills etc, because he doesn’t live there and still pays bills at his home. (yeah, I know).

My bills include student loans, day care, and routine home mortgage, etc.  I do not receive child support.   (Father was largely willfully unemployed).  While I am employed at a full time (and decently paying job) as a single mom, it’s tight. Husband doesn’t help with bills.

As if this wasn’t problematic enough, my daughter’s father has decided that he would now like to be involved and sued me for joint custody after being absent 10 years. I’m hemorrhaging money for lawyers to keep my kid safe (he has assaulted his current wife multiple times, and has been convicted and has had dealings with CPS).Between that, and unexpected medical bills (I found a lump ya’ll, lets hope it’s all good), I can no longer pay all my bills. While Im up to date today, I have nearly exhausted my very meager savings and maxed out the cards.  I believe the solution is that I will sell the house and try to live with my sister for 6-9 months to get some savings (paying rent, I’m no mooch). 

Where is the husband? sitting on his ass watching all of this go down.  Husband has made no effort to sell his home (his is a bachelor pad with not enough space for an instant family) AND i learned 3 days ago that he is sitting on 50k in savings.  What?!?!?I told him my plan to sell and live with family and all he had to say was,  I guess I won’t be able to come over any more. WTF you are my husband, that should not be your response!

Anyway, he is taking me to dinner today to celebrate our anniversary. today, i cannot divorce. I have neither money or internal fortitude for that on top of all the other things. I will save that fight for another day (that day will come,  but not now). FML.",relationship_advice
t3_chpz1w,"I (20F) had a pregnancy scare, and my bf (23M) has been acting emotional, not sure how to stop being upset with him","Alright, so this all started a few days ago. My shrink suspected I might be pregnant, so he had a referral written for me to go take a lab test to check. I went to a different hospital to get it done the next day and was told they would call my doctor and he would call me. I had told my boyfriend and I spent the day stressing at work over it. I get home (I still hadn't gotten the test results then) and call him to discuss what we would do if I was pregnant. He assured me that whatever I wanted to do he would be down for, and he just wanted me to be happy. I pressed him, but he swore he was telling the truth. I tell him I don't think I'd want to get an abortion and he agrees.

&amp;#x200B;

 I go to bed and the next day I'm bombarded by text messages sent at like 4 am from him about how he's freaking out and so not ready and doesn't want to do this. This upset me because I felt lied to and wished he had told me that from the start instead of just texting me. We talked on the phone and I said I'd get an abortion if I was pregnant and said I wanted to (which was a lie, I just didn't want him to feel worse because I was worried he was having a panic attack) It turns out I wasn't pregnant. We are both relieved, but a part of me is angry he dumped all of that on me through text when I was already in an extremely emotionally vulnerable state, which he knew since I did a lot of crying on the phone the night before.

&amp;#x200B;

We had made plans to go to the beach on friday, and I texted him that if I was standoffish it was because I wasn't very happy with him. He asked why. That pissed me off. i tried to stay calm and say I wasn't mad at him, just upset in general. He apologized, but I was still a bit annoyed. The later on I was talking to him about a jacket I was thinking of buying and asked if I would look good in it. He said ""You know what I think is beautiful? Not spending unnecessary money on shit like you do"" and I was offended. I tried to diffuse the situation by agreeing, but I don't even know why he cares. We don't live together or share finances and I normally pay when we go out to eat so its not like I'm broke. This made me feel resentful. I'm supposed to see my boyfriend today after work but I'm still sort of mad at him. I know I'm probably wrong to be mad, but how do I get over it? I love him and I don't want to ruin our time together being salty. Should I talk to him about it?",relationship_advice
t3_chm0sp,BF wants to go on a trip with his female besfriend?,"Basically as the title states. My BF is planning to go on a 2 week trip overseas with his female bestfriend. They've been friends for over two years now and this was something they had planned prior to us dating (we've been dating for 6 months). They've been on a few trips together before &amp; evidently they're super close with each other.

He insists that they're just ""friends"" and love each other like siblings but I feel like it's odd to have a friend of the opposite sex as a solo travel buddy...especially when you have a girlfriend.

t3_chobid,My mom is very unhealthy and is passing these habits to my (26f) sister (8f),"My mom is both mentally and physically unhealthy and is passing this on to my much younger sister. I don’t know how to act without overstepping. 

My has always had very poor  habits but over the past 10 years everything has really gone down hill. She is extremely overweight. I don’t know specifics but she’s about 5’1 and weighs close to 300 i think. She’s a chain smoker, probably a pack a day. She never drinks anything but pop. She literally says  water makes her throw up. So from the minute she gets up to when she goes to bed, pop. She doesn’t eat anything healthy and is extremely picky. She only likes fast food or meat heavy dishes like pork roast. She hasn’t touched a vegetable in years. Not even on her burgers. Her teeth are rotting out. She went to the dentist yesterday and she has over 10 cavities. Should wouldn’t tell me how many specifically but it’s over 10. This is from her drinking pop, smoking, eating non stop sugar and not brushing her teeth. She has diabetes but doesn’t take care of it. At all. She also has a few other health issues that go unmanaged. She also naps everyday for about 2 hours. Every day. This is just physically unhealthy. She’s also mentally unhealthy. She’s very lazy. She’s also depressed (again unmanaged). She thrives on drama. And she’s in a very very toxic relationship but misery likes company I guess.  that’s just the tip of the iceberg with her. 

That’s her life, do when you want. I’ve had numerous talks with her and it never goes anywhere so I gave up years ago. Here’s my problem, she’s instilling these habits in my sister (8f). Yes we’re really 19 years apart. My sister has a lot of health issues. Non that are in her control, she basically just hit worst genetic lottery possible. But with all these, she’s fully functioning. Non of them are mental, all physical but none that affect her day to day very drastically. My sister spends a lot of time at my house. I think it has to do with getting away from her parents constant fighting and the fact that I take her to do things. My mom doesn’t encourage her to get out of the house. In fact, if she sat on her tablet all day and let my mom nap and watch tv, my mom would be thrilled (mom works very part time nights). My sister spends most of her time on her tablet or computer in her room. She’s a couch potato at home. When shes at my house, she’s always outside playing with the dogs or my son. She wants to go to the pool or the park. She WANTS to do things. I’m sure she wants to do things at her house too but my mom just doesn’t want to so they don’t. 
Another thing is my sister has terrible eating habits too. Yesterday I picked up some produce and she was so curious about something I had. Asking me a million questions about it, begging me to try it. It was a peach. She’s 8 and never had a peach. And it’s not because she doesn’t have access or my mom can’t afford it it’s because my mom eats like shit and so does she. She loved the peach btw. I made spaghetti for dinner. Plain ole spaghetti. My sister wouldn’t touch it. She insisted on buttered noodles instead. Then I encouraged her to try a green bean. She gagged. My sister will come over at like 5 pm and say she’s starving because the only thing she’s eaten all day was cereal (and I’m sure it’s like lucky charms or other pure sugar). But then won’t touch anything I make because it’s not pork roast or buttered noodles (im vegan but I’m not a health nut or anything so I don’t cook meat but I don’t force her to eat salads or anything. Ill make grilled cheese or basically recreate anything she’d eat at home but she still won’t touch it because it’s “vegan”.) I usually have to force my sister to brush her teeth. She also has a bunch of cavities and her teeth are pretty yellow. 

With my sisters diseases, she could really benefit from staying active and eating healthy and I feel like my mom is really really failing her. I don’t know how to approach this. My mom is not easy to talk to. She’s going to say I’m over stepping or I’m not perfect so I have no room to talk (I’m also overweight, I have a hormonal disease that makes me blow up. But with that said, I try and instill great habits in my son. I encourage activity, healthy eating, and cooking. Even if I’m not perfect, he can at least have the tools to be successful later in life but I digress) 
What should I do?

t3_chqj2i,I comforted my moms married friend. Need help ASAP on how to deal with this.,"Firstly,  i doubt anyone of you are gonna believe this. But whatever, it's true.  I'm not asking for a 'fist-bump' or anything. I'm asking for advice on  how to deal with this mentally.

To  lay it out, i'm a 21 year old male. My moms friend is currently a 54  year old woman and has known my mom (and as an extension, myself) for 40  years. They went to school together, lived near each other. All that  stuff. She's not Lisa Ann attractive. But she's also not ugly. She's fit  for her age. Unimportant, but i'm not trying to make y'all believe i  had sex with a bombshell.

We  don't see each other often, only really for family gatherings, but  we're still close family friends. She does see my mom every week though  so they talk a lot. My mom also trusts me, so she tells me everything.  For the past few months, she's told me that her friend hasn't been happy  with her husband recently. He's been manipulative and acting stranger  than normal. And hasn't been giving her any attention. Now i don't care.  I just entertain my mom to give her someone to rant at.

Yesterday  night, i was on playstation with a couple buddies. My mom asks me to  take down some spare sweets (My mom works in a cafe, so she's always  cooking) to her friends house. After a short argument since we were in  the middle of a raid, i agreed. I head down there, give her the sweets  and she invites me in for a drink. I can't be assed, but i'm not an  asshole. So i go in.

We're  talking. She asks me about university, how my degrees going, all that  stuff. After a short convo, she breaks down. Tells me everything/most  things she's told my mom about her husband recently. Mentally while  she's explaining this, i'm remembering what my mother told me about her  and her husband. Maybe it's the wine, but i teared up too. One hug leads  to another, and we sleep together.  On the way out she thanked me.

I  hurry home, get back to my room (my mother was sleeping) and i break  down. Maybe it was me feeling sorry for her, or the guilt for what i've  done. I don't know. I throw up shortly after and haven't eaten since. I  don't know how to cope with this. My mom knows something is up since i'm  barely speaking to her or my siblings. It's the next day now and i'm so  sick to my stomach. I don't know what to do, i feel like the biggest  piece of shit in the world. But she also thanked me, so i clearly helped  her out. I just don't know.",relationship_advice
t3_chfgmt,My gf (23F) believes that she should wear the pants in the relationship. I (23M) am striving for equality and a relationship that doesn’t always tend to one persons needs.,"Literally, every argument we have is won by her, simply because it’s either her way or the highway. Frankly, I hate using the term ‘won’ because that implies we’re fighting for pride, that’s not how I want it, but that’s how she makes it. 2.5 years of being together and just this morning she told me that she should wear the pants and call all the shots. She’s saying that I’m not what she wants cause I want an equal relationship? 

I’m so lost. 

What the f*#k is this mentality where it’s okay for someone to take control of every decision that also has an affect on their partner? 

I’m creeping closer and closer towards leaving her. 

Please help me talk some sense into her. Give me some advice as to how I can fix this. I really don’t want to lose her. Surely we can be adults and treat each other as equals.

UPDATE: I broke up with her. Not sure what on earth is going to happen now. But I’m going to hold strong and do my best to keep myself together. She has been abusing me all day and no matter what I did to rectify the matter. It would not work. She just kept insulting me and even went as far to say that her ex, who’m btw abused her, treated her better than I. That was the last straw and now I’m just trying to do my best to mitigate the situation. Thank you to everyone who woke me up and to those who spent their time replying to me.

t3_chphip,My[F19] sister's [F22] relationship with her husband [M25] worries me,"So, my sister doesn't live with us, she lives with her husband in another state, she's visiting us because here we're going to celebrate her daughter's 3rd birthday.

I need advice because honestly I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't know if I might be exaggerating or not. Would you please tell me if this is something to worry about or if I'm just overthinking this?

And just a heads up, I might be a little biased because, well, I fucking hate the guy and I'm gonna tell you why, this might be a little long but bear with me please 

When I was 14 years old my sister visited us (she was living with my grandparents at the time) and of course, she told me all about her boyfriend, they've been together I think 1 year by that time. He and I had talked before, and we went along. It was really exciting to see her because we hadn't seen each other in two years, so we try to spend time with each other, talking and watching movies and another sister stuff. The problem started when he began to get mad if my sister didn't text him every single moment of the day, if she didn't text him she had to tell him why. That was the first thing I noticed that worried me. Then he elevated things, if she was on line (on Facebook, WhatsApp, etc) but not talking to him, he would sent her a message with ""who are you talking to?"" She wasn't talking to anybody, so she would say that to him, but he wouldn't believe and would told her to stop being on her phone, he doesn't want to see her on line. We went shopping and she bought some cute clothes to wear in Christmas, it was a cute top and skirt, she's short so the skirt was really long on her, she showed the clothes to her boyfriend and he prohibited her to wear that. I was shocked by that and even more shocked when she listened to him! 
But that's not all, he would constantly tell her he would pay plane tickets for her if she wanted to go in that day or the next one, mind you, she was staying here for only 2 weeks, she would decline and he would get mad. All of this seemed like big red flags to me and I said that to her, but she just brushed it off. In the last week, they got in a big fight. She was crying inconsolably, like broken hearted crying. She told me he had told her he was going to go out with some girls and basically told her he was going to cheat on her, that the only reason he was with her was because he thought she was pregnant (her period was late, but that day she got her period). She recently had gotten an ectopic pregnancy, they were trying to have kids but they couldn't. That made me hate him, and I still do. It was just a cruel thing to do. 
But guess what? They made up, and she left happily.

They married the year after, because she was pregnant.

So now she's here, she tells me every time they have a fight. The first one was because of money (he wanted to buy some stupid shit and she told him not to), the second fight was because she didn't told him she was going to buy some food (she left her phone in the house, he called. She didn't answer. The food stand was 5 minutes from my grandparents' house). The third fight was because he wanted to video chat with his daughter, but my niece was asleep and he got mad because my sister didn't called him earlier. The fourth one, happened just days ago, he was horny and wanted to sext or send videos idk, and my sister fall asleep, he got mad and immediately asked her if she was cheating on him, if she didn't like him anymore, and then told her their relationship wasn't working and he wanted a divorce. 

He has threatened to get a divorce in almost every fight they have, which I think is a shitty thing to do. My sister called me at 2 in the morning because of this, and she literally told me is her fault because even when she was with him, sometimes she would tell him she doesn't want to have sex, or she falls asleep, or something, so he gets mad, but doesn't make her to do anything, and they fight about it. I was shocked when she told me that, I told her it's not her fault she doesn't want to have sex, he should respect that. If he was horny he could masturbate, but not shame her for not wanting to have sex or for falling asleep. She said he told her after telling her he wanted a divorce, if she meets someone else she shouldn't do that to that person, or then they gonna leave her for another woman. I can tell she feels guilty because she sometimes doesn't have sex with him, she told me she knows she have to because they're married and I just said she doesn't have to if she doesn't want to. She says he respects when she doesn't want to have sex but I told her its not respect if the first thing he thinks is that she's having an affair, or that something must be wrong with her (he had mentioned he thinks she had a sexual deficit or some stupid shit like that), if he really was worried about her, he wouldn't act like that, or idk just simply understand she doesn't want to have sex?? 
She stills defends him, she thinks it's her fault. She said he acts like that when she's away, that when she's gone he just doesn't think straight, she said he had a strong character and when he was mad he would do that stuff. I told her just because he's mad he doesn't get to treat you like shit, he doesn't trust you if the first thing he thinks is you're cheating on him.

I don't know what to do, I don't know if I'm overreacting or not. I've never been in a relationship so I don't know a lot of things. She says he's a good husband and a good father, but I just don't think he is because of how is he acting right now.

t3_cho03b,My[33F] husband [33M] does not have money for food but does for porn.,"My husband and I have been together for over 8 years. We are a middle income family of two that is just keeping our heads above water. The last few years our funds have been devoted to renovating and repairing our character home an ongoing project with no end in the near future.

The issue that spawned this post is from finding that he had resubscribed with a newly created email account to a porn website last night. I  really do not have much of an issue with my husband viewing porn. I won't lie I wish I could afford the lashes, lip injections, perfect hair extensions and a little more time at the gym but I digress. Paying for porn, I do have an issue with. Yesterday evening we were out for dinner for the first time in years with friends and he told me before we left the house that he did not have much funds so that I would be getting dinner for the both of us. That's cool. I  do not mind. Dinner was about $40ish after tax, not bad. He tipped the waiter $10. When I got up this morning to get ready for work I noticed his computer was left on overnight. This is mild irritation as we don't have air conditioning and both our computers run pretty hot. Screen was left open to (in a new email account I was not aware of) a porn website stating thanks secondchoicetea husband! Your payment of $16.55 has been approved at 11:53 PM which was about 30 minutes after we went to bed last night. It bummed me out. Not enough funds to share a meal with me. But enough for that clearly. 

It irritates me as this nearly identical situation happened 4 years ago. He did not have enough money to pay his phone bill. So I paid it. He got a new email account and subscription to porn site later that evening after I went to sleep. I ended up confronting him the next day but he was eyeballs deep in addiction at the time and it was not a very productive exchange.

t3_chlol7,How much sex is the right amount for a married couple? Just looking for opinions.,"I don’t even know where to start. I’ve been with my husband.. complicated, was my wife for 13 years. We have been married for 5. In the last two years he transitioned from being my wife to my husband. I was cool with it that’s not really the issue. However we are literally never intimate anymore.  If I were to count it I would break my heart. Maybe 2-3 times in as many months. We used to be rabbits pretty much. Very in touch with each other and what the other person wanted. Now when we do get intimate it’s always mind blowing amazing but very rarely does it happen.  

 He has a lot of rules, Like only at night, Only in our bed. Never on holidays.  I have to initiate it or ask for it. There has to be “preparations” like getting a towel and shit ready. It.... just completely kills the mood for me. I don’t even know what it’s like to have “passionate sex” or have someone rip my clothes off. I’m super sexually liberated and want to fuck anywhere (legally) and try all kinds of crazy stuff. But with all the rules and lack of spontaneity I don’t even feel interested anymore. Any thoughts? Is there anyway for me to care less about the “prep” or how can I help him be more spontaneous?",relationship_advice
t3_chp74e,Does a serious relationship have to involve love?,"My partner is hesitant to meet my friends because they are not sure if they are ready to be in love again, and meeting my friends would be a step toward a more serious relationship. 

I, personally, do not think think a serious relationship has to involve love. 
To me, a serious relationship is a long-term, monogamous relationship. It involves things such as each member of the relationship having met each others friends and/or family, and they plan things together in the future such as vacations or events.
A serious relationship to me involved commitment, trust, and mutual respect.",relationship_advice
t3_chq48o,My boyfriend constantly tells me not to cheat on him!,"We been together for a year. Lately he tells me everyday that not to cheat on him it's getting really annoying. 

He told me if he finds out I'm cheating on him he's just going to leave and never see me again and he promised that.  The fact that he keeps worrying about it bothers me because when he was younger he said he cheated on his wife cuz he didn't love her so I don't understand why he thinks I would be a cheater when I never cheated on any of my boyfriend's and he knows that.

I was so annoyed that he kept telling me that that, so I told him since I'm a Scorpio and if I find out you are cheating on me I'm going to cheat on you and prove it in your face and then leave you just so you can feel my pain and he got really upset and bothered that I said that but I can't help it that's who I am.

Sometimes I think he just says that because he feels bad that he cheated so he puts the blame on me and feels guilty and tells me not to cheat. What are your guys  thoughts and suggestions? Why does he have to keep saying that to me?",relationship_advice

t3_chnpl3,MY BF (28M) of 1.5 years has basically stopped having sex with me (28F) and I dont know what to do," 

So since I moved in with my BF our sex life has declined. I understand that’s a natural thing in a relationship. At first I attributed it to his new job with long hours. We were on opposite schedules and he worked in the evenings. We talked about the change around December. I thought something was wrong so I went through his phone. ( oh shhhhh - yeah it was wrong but that’s a different discussion) Porn - EVERYDAY- while I’m at work or while I’m sleeping he’s watching porn and not having sex with me. I confronted him. He said he’s just edging himself most of the time. He said he would go back to the therapist and get on his meds and start working out again and it would change his sex drive. He seemed sorry for neglecting me. So I gave him some time. I let it be. He started therapy so I thought it was good news. 

We had the same conversation in April because I realized we only have had sex six times that year at that point. Same answers when we talked again…. Going to the gym… therapy ect. - I was skeptical about his gym comment because he mentioned it before and never started going. I thought because he was in therapy it was a good sign. 

Cut to now. I can count how many times we have had sex this year on my fingers and toes. Well I couldn’t sleep last night. I was trying to look at some school information I had previously viewed and I went into the history and I immediately was able to see his browser history. Porn everyday - for at least the last sixty days - and he watched it right when he left to go to the other room to sleep. I am LIVID. He stopped going to therapy out of laziness and he’s been to the gym - never. 

A couple of important notes.

&amp;#x200B;

* I have no problem with porn. I watch it all the time 
* My boyfriend has anxiety and depression. He is also an introvert.

To be honest we have gained some weight - about 30 lbs each - and I quit caring about how I look about two months ago. Its an awful catch 22 but his lack of interest took a huge hit on my self esteem and the longer we go the worse it gets. I have never said no to sex. I give BJ’s randomly and regularly as well. Im not boring in bed (I’m a red head) and my kitty is always clean and fresh, so I really just don’t understand. We literally have zero problems in the rest of our relationship, I don’t understand what’s so unappealing about me? I don’t know where to go from here.

t3_chal71,"My [19F] younger brother [16M] is becoming increasingly hateful towards women, because of my mom's affair","Hello, I would like to seek some advice on how to help my younger brother, who I think is becoming an angry, depressed kid.

Backstory: My parents are in the midst of divorce proceedings, after our mother was found having a prolonged affair last year. My brother was the one to catch them in the act, and I think the responsibility of letting the family know weighed on him a lot. He has told me he is absolutely furious with our mom for doing this to dad and the entire family, and that she's a whore. I understood his feelings and was (am still) similarly angry at her for being so incredibly selfish that she would throw away all of our love just for her own feelings.

Recently, my brother's rants have taken a worrying slant. He is now insulting women in general, calling us all sorts of degrading names. I've overheard him say that women deserved to be raped, while he was gaming. I've called him out on this multiple times including by pointing out I am a woman too. But he has always assured me that I'm ""not one of them"" and ""different"", whatever that means, and then does nothing to change. My suggestions of either individual or family therapy to process my mom's cheating (and maybe to help him on this issue) have been ignored by everyone in the family, including my elder brother (25M) who is not at home.

I am afraid that this is terribly unhealthy and he shouldn't be left alone to fester. I'm moving out of state for college soon. I hate to see my brother stay behind and suffer. I've raised this concern to my dad, but he is low-key spiralling into alcoholism and actually agrees with my brother on his views of my mom.

I would love some advice as to what else to do? I'm not his legal guardian, I can't force him to do something he doesn't want to do. My parents are not helping.",relationship_advice
t3_chovkv,My husband makes sexist and colorist remarks about our own daughter,"my husband (m, 26) and me (f, 24) have a very young daughter who just turned a year old a few days ago. my daughter is beautiful, people stop me in the store and street just to tell me. but my husband has said some things about her looks that really have pissed me off. she was born light like most newborns and then darkened up in a few weeks. my husband expressed his disappointment about this right to my face one day when I was feeding her. and he hasn’t really ever dropped it since. the reason im writing this is i was on the phone with my husband and i told him i was outside with the kids. and he said, “take her inside, she’ll get too dark from the sun”. the reason i think this is all sexist is that our son who is three, is darker than my daughter and my husband has never said anything about his color. it bothers me deeply because i grew up with a father who all my childhood and still now made sexual comments about me and i know how it feels. i don’t know how to talk to my husband about this, i have called him out on it but he doesent stop. and i need him to before she is old enough to understand what he is saying about her. he’s a great father otherwise, but i need to this to end.",relationship_advice

t3_chpha8,Are homemade gifts equal to financially bought gifts?,"Sorry for the long post 

So im a uni student and so to be honest am completely skint. My boyfriend has a decent job and likes to spend money on me which i am extremely grateful for. He bought me this dress for my birthday id mentioned offhand i liked and i was blown away that he remembered and got me in. Ive bagged myself a real sweetheart. 

I wanted to give something back but couldnt afford anything amazing so painted the night sky the exact time we first met up and kissed (we'd talked for two months before actually meeting up) and included a Shakespeare quote because he and i like Shakespeare. 

My bf said he loved the gift and it was sentimental and beautiful but when i called up my mum who sidenote didnt even ask what the gift was and said id made something homemade she stated that it wasnt enough considering how much for my bday he had spent on me. 

We went out (not saying where as dont want to give myself away) and when arrived he revealed he'd already brought the tickets for me and had pre ordered tickets for something else, then he had also got me the dress.

I ended up buying him somethinf too but im already way into my overdraft so puts even more strain on my bank account but i just want him to know how much i love and appreciate him and was wondering if a homemade sentimental gift is equal to a gift that has been paid for really.

t3_chg99y,My (F26) friend (F29) thought her boyfriend would propose by now and won't discuss my plans now that I am engaged,"My friend Dani has been with her boyfriend since they were 17. They had a lot of issues in the beginning, but have been a solid couple for the past few years. They have been together the longest in our friend group. Last year, our friends got engaged, and this slightly sparked something in Dani. She had said she and her boyfriend had not really discussed marriage before. They knew at some point, but hadn't had a serious conversation about it.

Then there was a tragedy in Dani's family before the new year and this really brought marriage to her priority. She brought up to her boyfriend that she wanted to be married soon, start looking at venues, everything. She then decided to start planning her bachelorette party. She had planned for an overseas trip the following year in the winter, to then be married in the spring. She approached 6 of us, asking if we'd be in for this trip for her bachelorette party. We agreed, and she made it sound like she was sure they' be engaged soon.

It has been five months since we started paying for this trip. She and her boyfriend are going on a trip this weekend and she suspected he would be proposing on it. She told us she believed he had the ring for a few months now, and we were ready to celebrate with her. However, one of our friends had a heart to heart with him, and he is very upset how hard she is pushing this. He doesn't have the money for a ring or a wedding, and has told her that repeatedly, but she won't listen. So, he wants to wait a year to save and propose. We now know he won't be proposing, but she still expects it to happen. She has also previously said to us that he had until the end of the year. We don't know how serious she is about that.

So, we've all put money towards this trip that is supposed to be a bachelorette party, that will end up not being one.

My second part:

My now fiance proposed two months ago. We were super excited and started planning immediately. We booked our venue, asked our party, and began the whole process. I started planning my bachelorette party, but she has repeatedly told me to wait another month or two before I start really planning it. It didn't make much sense to me, because our wedding is only eight months away. I don't have anything extravagant planned, but I wanted to get that booked away. I believe she is wanting me to wait so that she can have her moment of excitement of being newly engaged, have the spot light.

&amp;#x200B;

So my issues/questions:

1) How do we tell her to relax on discussing wedding plans and pushing him so hard? 

2) How can I kindly approach the fact I want to plan mine and that there is not reason to wait? It is starting to be frustrating but I don't want any arguments.",relationship_advice

t3_chqhda,My wife (30F) is overly touchy and close with her friends children to the point that I'm uncomfortable.,"All of my wife's friends have children. Not just one child but multiple. She is the Godmother to all these children and she has signed legal documents to be their legal guardian if the parents were to ever die. I was not in the picture when she did this but I do think it's not a very bright idea. Though to be fair she didn't ever believe she would get married so she never thought about how a future husband would feel.

These kids range from ages 3 to 15. Sometimes they like to come round our house for dinner or cuddle up with my wife on the couch and watch TV. She helps them with school and she often helps buy them things. If you had said she breastfed them as babies I'd totally believe it. They call her mom too even though she is just their godmother. She acts more like a devout foster mom/adopted mother than anything else. She would pretty much die for these kids.

My wife is infertile and we have been trying for 5 years with no success. She's given up wanting to try and I don't want to adopt.

I remember when I was becoming a young adult in grammar school. I never cuddled my own mom at that point. Then again ive never had a godmother or godfather so I don't know what they are exactly supposed to be doing.

I think these kids need to be weaned off her and the parents need to step up and be more parental. My wife says I'm crazy.

t3_chp9lh,"Boyfriend is on Grindr, discovered his dildos, etc","Throwaway account for this because you know why!!

TL;DR basically title, discovered boyfriend’s dildos, a single nude, gay porn searches

So earlier this year, I decide to deep clean our condo in preparation for a lovely springtime. I am mostly doing this by myself because BF works ~9 hours a day, but I like cleaning so I don’t mind. This day I did our room, and start cleaning out and organizing one of the closets. In a box with a bunch of random shit I find a grocery bag with TWO dildos, one having a remote for vibration. The year before last, he had told me he had a dildo but threw it away. This was not true. 

I should also mention we have been dating for four years, since high school. The comment about the thrown away dildo (in 2017) was the first I had ever heard of him being bi-curious. 

At the time I thought it was kind of funny and left the box be. However, curiosity had its hold over me and I snooped his phone. (I know this is bad- it wasn’t out of trustworthiness but to see what was going on with him). Anyways, I was scrolling through his recently used apps and the App Store was up in his later used apps, and had Grindr shown on it with that little cloud symbol next to it, meaning he had downloaded it at least once. 

I continue looking on his phone, not sure how to feel, and I find a recently deleted photo of his dick, that was clearly meant to send to someone else (not me, I never receive nudes from him). Look at his history on safari and see lots of intense gay porn searches. Still don’t know how I feel, however I’m not worried about him actually meeting up with anyone. 

So now we’re at current times, things have been fine no real problems. Obviously have not mentioned these things to him, as I know he will tell me on his own time. I also want to mention I have been gone for the past week volunteering. Look at his phone again tonight bc why not (sorry again). See Grindr again was being downloaded on the App Store, see gay porn searches, and really odd, see handcuff searches? He’s never once mentioned to me wanting to buy those or surprising me with them. I try to estimate when Grindr was downloaded, and it was about Saturday or Sunday, his two days off, both of which I am still gone. This is a stretch but I looked at his recently searched addresses and one of them was Kum and Go (lol I know) in our hometown, now I am wondering if he actually met a guy there??? 

I don’t know what to do. I am bisexual myself and I took my several years to figure myself out. He is only on the second year I believe of exploring his sexuality. I get not wanting to tell me- but I do not want him to be meeting up with other guys. Nudes, sexting, whatever that’s fine. But I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to reveal I’ve been looking at his phone, because obviously that’s shitty, but I don’t know about revealing the dildos either because he’s obviously not ready yet to tell me. 

I don’t know what to do!!!! (Again)!!!! Please help with advice or similar situations anyone has been in. Sorry for the formatting and long paragraphs as well, I am on my phone.

So I (M16) am with a girl, also 16, its young love, and some people frown upon that, but I'm optimistic, if that discourages you, then don't read on. I'd rather not be lectured about young love and your opinions on it.

I'm also gonna start off with saying she cheated on her ex for me, and left her ex for me, hence my insecurity on all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

So I haven't been with her for the longest time, only a couple months at this point, but I absolutely adore her, obviously. I always have done and I'm overwhelmed with happiness when I'm around her and ect ect, honeymoon period type things.However, recently she has gone on this trip which lasts around a month, and she's met people there, as people typically would and has made friends, which is not an issue for me whatsoever.

I need to start this with saying a bit about myself. Typically? I'm never jealous, I will have my moments but a tiny bit of jealousy to me shows passion and that you care. Typically I'm happy for my SO's to do as they wish, and I trust for them not to do things I'm not a fan of (obvious things I won't list such as cheating)

This time however, it's just different. They started off playing games and what not, but they were games only me and her played when we were getting close and learning about each other, not uncommon or made up games mind you, just our inside games we'd play and still do play with. Not an issue however. But then she talks about him all the time to me, like nearly constantly. Instead of talking to her half the time she gives him her phone to talk to me as if I'd like to talk to him. Then she tells me about how she went to rest her head on his shoulder, slept on his shoulder. This wouldn't be an issue but when she's done it with other people her reasoning was ""Because I was tired"" I dont mind, I get that. But with him it's because ""He was there"". Okay then I guess? Then she tells me about how she held his hand, and how she scratches his back, and then he sends me videos of her playing with his leg, as in scratching his leg up and down with her nails, rests her hand on his legs and thighs, and I'm not a fan of this. I openly said I'm not comfortable with that, and asked for her not to. She said she wouldn't but then she did it again a few days later. I again said not to do it, and she said she forgot which I tried to be understanding about and didn't give her shit for it. The next day, she sends me pictures of him with his hand on her thigh, and I let it slide, I can't be arsed with arguing, then tells me about her scratching his back, sends photos and what not, and then sends me pictures of her with her hand on her chest, things like that

I brought it up, It pissed me off and I just said ""You need to stop that shit, being so touchy with each other. I've told you I don't like it but you persist on doing it. I want to trust you but I'm finding it difficult at the moment""She just told me to fuck up and she needs space, so I've given her it. I haven't heard from her since then

&amp;#x200B;

Anytime I try to civilly talk it through, she does her hardest to avoid it (it seems that way at least)

I'll also admit, because of my past experiences, I'm not exactly mentally stable. I heavily suffer with depression which nobody wants, and I don't like her having to deal with that part of me. But she stopped me from doing things such as cutting, which I did my best to hide. she caused me to stop self harming, but because of all this? I need to take it all out so I end up hitting myself and it just causes overthinking. There is plenty more to this, but I've only mentioned the most important parts to me. I just don't know what to do. Am I overthinking all of this? Should I trust her? I fucking adore her but this shit is kind of breaking me, and I'm never usually this jealous and insecure about it, but I don't want to lose her. It's just kind of breaking me, but hey, that's young love for you. What do I do?",relationship_advice
t3_cho99o,My [26/M] EX Gf [26/F] wants me to pay for a flight change for a trip we planned while we were still dating to avoid seeing me at the airport,"So basically my now ex and I had planned a trip a couple months ago to Japan, but we recently broke up about a month ago. We had dated for 2 years and this trip was going to be done with 3 of her best friends as well. Anyways, she is now saying the thought of seeing me at the airport or on the airplane will be too much for her to handle and wants me to change my flight. 

Our trip isn't for another 2 months and I called about changing just my flight time which will cost me about $730. I am perfectly fine with going on this trip by myself while she can enjoy it with her friends, but I don't see it fair that I should pay for this fee. I suggested to her friend that my ex should be the one to pay it, but her friend didn't think that's fair. I also think it's an unnecessary expense if my ex does choose to pay it because again we are merely sharing a plane together.

While I was the one who broke up with her (for legitimate reasons that everyone accepts) I don't  think sharing a plane to Japan would be the end of the world. She won't die if she sees me, I'm not the creature from Bird Box. We can also pick seats nowhere near eachother and minimize any sightings of each other at the airport. Her friend said I should either sell my ticket, change flight times, or just forego the trip entirely because I should consider the emotional impact to my ex having to see me at the airport or on the plane. 

Personally, I would like us to just to share this flight while sitting away from each other and once in Japan we can enjoy the adventure separately. My ex and her friends are adamant that if I choose to go on this trip still during that same flight time that I am just being petty. 

TL;DR My ex wants me to pay for a flight change so she doesn't have to see me at the airport for a trip we planned whilst still dating. She is going on this trip with her friends while I am now going solo, but I don't believe this is an expense I should incur and that we should just be adults and share a plane together.",relationship_advice
t3_chp6lt,MIL going off the deep end,"For the past year or so my wife and I have been having problems with her mother.  It started about the time she started “dating” a man named Andy.  MIL would make plans with us for weeks and randomly cancel 10 minutes before and say she had to go do something with Andy.  Ok fine, I understand that.  But when we do get together with her all she does is complain how he only cares about himself, he never makes time for her or shifts his schedule around, etc.  so naturally my wife and I don’t have a high opinion of this guy ( who she has not allowed us to meet).  

Well this past year MIl has become more and more bipolar, snapping at us any time we make a negative comment about this guy.  Or she will be giddy and laughing telling us how sweet he is( but never with any sort of detail as to why).  

My MIL has digestive health issues and really had to watch what she eats and drinks, and ever since this guy is in the picture she is ignoring that and trying to eat what he eats and apparently drinking too much.

So yesterday my MIL is calling us nonstop saying she’s not feeling well, throwing up, etc.  We ask if she is eating well and she says “well I ate this and this and then Andy and I ate this and margaritas”.  We tell her lay off the junk and just eat bland food ( we her doctors orders).  

Fast forward to 11 pm that night and she is calling us saying she needs to go an ER or she is going to die.  So we rushed over and took her to one.  She was so dehydrated and sick that they gave her multiple bags of fluid and started asking questions about her health. What meds she takes, what she eats, etc.  She can’t give them 100% what she’s taking but she is on heart meds and anti depressants among other things.  She says she isn’t watching what she eats and she is drinking 2-3 drinks as well as 4-5 glasses of wine.... a DAY.  

We get her settled back at home after everything, go shopping the next morning to get her everything she should be eating, take her cat with us because she isn’t taking care of it.  And the whole time there is not one thank you or mention of us helping her.  In fact she keeps repeating how Andy told her the sweetest thing.  We asked what( rolling our eyes). And she said he told her “if you are sick call 911”.  Yeah really sweet.

Admittedly we went off on her a little harsh but basically said that she needs to start taking care of herself and also realize that this Andy guy is never around when she needs him.  

So my MIL responded by blocking both of our phone numbers.  And apparently (hearing from a friend of her) she went out the next night with this Andy guy for dinner while she was supposed to be resting.

How should we deal with this?  She needs to stop drinking so much, in fact she needs to stop period.  Any time we mention getting her help she shuts down and either leaves or hangs up.  We literally are just trying to look out for her but this guy apparently has her wrapped around his finger with no regard for her.

TLDR;  MIL won’t take care of herself and won’t let us help.",relationship_advice
t3_chqdy5,Found out my girlfriend who has been gone all summer cheated on me,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year and she got an internship this summer halfway across the country. 

Before she left for her internship at the begging of the summer we got into an argument a day before she left and did not resolve it till about a week after. 

Backstory she has a list of all the guys she’s slept with on her phone and since we have been dating I have been the last guy on it. About a month ago her friend posted a photo her with the list and I noticed a new name after mine. After seeing this I texted her confronting her about it but she said he was a guy she slept with over a year ago and just forgot to put his name down. I decided to believe her but was always skeptical about it.

Fast forward to now, I got a plane ticket to come visit her and spend the week with her. 

I would never normally do this but one night when she was asleep I decided to go through her phone just to make sure nothing happened with this guy. I saw the texts between her and her best friend where she talked about hooking up with him about a week after she started her internship. Her reasoning for it was that we were on a break but I didn’t know we were even having a break..

I decided to go through her phone more and found out she flirted with other guys through Instagram dms, and even sent her ex a nude for some weed. 

After seeing all this I woke her up and confronted her about everything and she denied it until I showed her proof of it. We talked about it for hours and she said she did it because she was mad at me and we were on a break, but realized throughout the summer that she is truly in love with me.

I love this girl with all my heart and even got a ring to propose with in the next year, but I can’t stop thinking about what happened whenever I’m with her.

My husband came home from work in a bad mood, and he started going in on me right away. He yelled at me about not having the dishes done, the house being messy, and not having dinner ready. Usually I come home from work and do it all quickly before he’s home, but I couldn’t because my kids were sick and I have a baby. I tried to ignore his yelling but he came into the kitchen, grabbed my arm, turned me around, and said to me, “don’t you have anything to say for yourself?”

I told him I’m really sorry and that I was taking care of them all day and I didn’t have time but I tried. 

He told me to stop making excuses.

I just was so stressed, I started to cry. And I never cry in front of him but I did. 

He asked me what I had to cry about, I told him it’s just hard. and he told me, “I can make it a lot harder for you”

I told him I’m sorry again, and he told me “sorry for what? being a horrible wife?”

I asked what he wants from me and he told me “here’s what I want from you, you’re going to quit your job and stay here all day. and you’re never gonna have me come home to this again, do you understand?”

I tried to say something but he yelled, “do you understand?”. and I said yes, then he told me to finish cleaning and then come to bed. 

I don’t understand why he doesent see everything I do for him, ive never done this before it was one time. It was really hard to have a newborn baby and two sick kids, and he just doesent see it. This is my fault for being too perfect all the time but I don’t know what to do. But maybe I was wrong",relationship_advice

t3_chp4s5,MIL trying to guilt my wife and I to leave our vacation early for a wedding,"About 8 months ago, my wife and I (both 27) booked a 7 night stay in a quiet little coastal town about 2.5 hours from home with some close friends of ours. We just moved into our first home so a week long vacation was a serious stress relief, especially for me averaging 70-80hrs work week. We are currently on that vacation with plans to drive home Saturday morning. About 3-4 months ago, while we were in the process of buying our house, we received an invitation to my wife's cousin's wedding. She RSVPd yes and didn't think anything of it until she got a text from her mother yesterday reminding us a wedding is tomorrow. We decided instead of going, we'd just give an extra gracious cash gift (~$300) as an apology for not making it. Her mother's response was as follows:

""I can't believe you wouldn't come. Family is more important. Friends come and go but family is forever. I'm extremely disappointed in you.""

This made my wife break down in tears and made me livid. In order for us to leave early, we'd have to eat the $150/night for the last night (since it's such a small town and a little family owned motel). I wouldn't be able to assist my friend in getting our boat out of the water (which is also paid through Saturday for a marina slip), we'd have to rush home, tear through boxes and boxes of clothes in hopes to find something wedding worthy, then sit in rush hour traffic to get to a 6pm full-mass wedding (neither my wife or I are religious). We don't know what to do...

TLDR; MIL played the ""I'm disappointed"" card without even considering any inconvenience for us because we forgot about a wedding.",relationship_advice
t3_chqaqc,"My (22f) boyfriend (24m) is oblivious about his close female friend (24f), who's obsessed with him to an unhealthy degree.","Hi,

I (22f) have been dating my boyfriend (24m) for 15 months now.

Things between us are going great, but I'm somewhat bothered by him being too close with his female friend (24f), who's clearly into him and he seems to be somewhere between oblivious and willfully ignorant about her.

They've known each other since they were small children and have always been close.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to be clear here, I'm not the jealous type, I'm not accusing him of cheating, but I'm definitely worried about boundaries here.

It's obvious to pretty much anyone but him, that she has been orbiting him since forever. When he was single even his mom asked him why they never tried. 

He's still going with ""It's more like brotherly love"" and I think that he's genuine about that, but at some point he has to accept the truth about the nature of their relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

She has moved a few years back and now lives about 2 hours away, but literally never misses an opportunity to meet him, she jumps every single time as soon as he wants her to. He only does this for her if it's something actually important, but she would drop other friends just because he asked if she was available.

When spending the night at his place she tried things like looking for lame excuses like an 'uncomfortable couch' to sleep in the same bed, but he shut that down, because he knows that I wouldn't approve. Apparently he didn't always do this in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

He says that she has always been cuddly and a bit overly attached and I get that it might appear differently to him when this obsession slowly developed over the span of their lives, but even friends of mine who only met her a few times instantly told me to keep an eye on her.

I know that some of her previous boyfriends had issues with her behavior as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Another point I'm worried about is oversharing.

She has always been his emotional support friend, he says that he feels more comfortable about sharing with her than with his male friends. They even discuss their relationship issues and sex lives.

I'm not even bothered by the latter, good she knows that I fuck his brains out, but talking about relationship issues in that constellation could be potentially dangerous. 

There aren't indications that she abuses her position, but I could easily see how she might if we started having more serious issues.

&amp;#x200B;

While I would probably prefer it, I know he wouldn't drop his life long friend even if I wanted him to.

I trust him, I never got any suspicious vibes from him in this regard, but I want him to see and admit how things truly are.

This isn't healthy and while I don't care about her wellbeing, he does and he should see that this can't be good for her mental health and future potential relationships.",relationship_advice
t3_chqae7,my (20F) boyfriend (20M) might still think he's more attractive than I am and it's tough on my self worth,"Having issues with my (20 F) boyfriend (20M) of about a year and a half. We started out our relationship as friends in college and while we were friends he told me about how much he liked a female friend he went to high school and now we all go to the college with but she wasn't into him. Not long after we started dating I was joking around and said that I felt like the 'reacher' rather than the 'settler' because he was so great, and to my surprise he agreed that I was the reacher and that he could do better (not in those words exactly). He said as a justification that his female friend (the one that he had been interested in) said he could do better than me. Obviously this caused some crying and a bit of a fight but he resolved it saying he didn't mean it and it was just and automatic response to agree with me. 

Fast forward a while, our relationship has had a few bumps but overall pretty good. Throughout the past year or so I have realized I really do love him and he is (almost always) incredibly sweet and good to me. He still hangs out with said female friend (but we've talked about how sometimes it makes me jealous/uncomfortable), but I also have become pretty good friends with a guy from class. He voiced some concern about the guy so I offered that I could spend less time with him or have all of us hang out more or do something to make it better. my boyfriend doesn't spend that much time with his female friend but when I get jealous he usually reassures me that I have nothing to worry about and that he loves me (which works). clearly we both have some issues with jealousy but we are pretty good about communicating and helping each other. 

After the last time he went to go catch up with his friend from high school, I told him afterwards some of the doubts I've been having about our relationship (aside from jealousy issues, we've been working a lot and things feel 'off'. It's scary to me that we are very young to be so deeply committed to each other) and also that thinking about this female friend brings up a lot of insecurity about him thinking he's more attractive than I am and that he could do better (not a new fight). At one point during our conversation, he said that at the time of the whole 'I can do better' fight, he was being honest and that it was stupid and based on looks alone and he doesn't think he can do better than me. He said this in an attempt to make me feel better, saying that now he thinks the world of me because he has gotten to know me more. of course it didn't make me feel better. As much as I wish I didn't care what he thought about how attractive I am and cared that he values other things about me, it still bothered me a LOT to hear him say that. he also brought up that maybe I'd like a break (he clarified that he didn't) but I said that as far as I know breaks are like a baby step for breakups. Not sure if it would be a good idea or not. 

Not that it really matters, but I think I am attractive and typically I'm not insecure about my looks. When I go out with friends people will hit on me and my girlfriends are really supportive and remind me how good of a person I am but also how pretty I am. generally I don't have an issue with confidence, but this situation with my boyfriend will come up occasionally and it is difficult for me to deal with. I do love him and 99% of the time he is amazing and makes me feel like a great person and very beautiful and all that good stuff. I just really don't know how to deal with this situation that comes up very rarely and would really appreciate some advice!

(as a side note i'd like to point out that this post is only focused on the worst parts of our relationship. usually I am very happy and feel confident and loved)

Me (M30) and my wife (M30) know each other for 15 years now, but only been together for the last 2. In short, we've been  highschool sweethearts, really liked each other but never did anything about it because we were really shy. After 13 years without contact, we crossed paths again and started dating.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were amazing, and after 1 year, we got married :) Im very, very happy with her by my side, and really think that she's the love of my life, and i feel it in her the same way, she always texts me cute messages, sex is great, we're best friends inside a marriage. I always try to do new things to with her, really cherish our relationship and work hard to not let it stall or get into a routine. I really think of myself as a good husband, she's the main priority in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

But around 3 months ago, some small things started to change, and i can't stop worrying about it. The cute texts stopped, now she only send cute messages as a respond if i send her first. The sex is still great, but when it happens (none for the past 2 weeks now), and im starting to think she's sad, depressed in fact. I tried several times to let her know that im there for her, try to sit her down and ask if everything is ok, but the response is always ""yes, why?"". And, the last 2 times that i try to say that im worried because somethings aren't normal, she responded really badly and now i don't know if i say something anymore or just go with it. The perception i have of her is that shes not happy, and im trying my best to figure it out or at least know that if its me, work, or anything else is happening.

&amp;#x200B;

I always thought that in a marriage, you're supposed to talk if things are going south, but now im scared to say something and make things worse. And with no conversation, i think things will get even badder. I need help, what should i do? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really think i have something special (or had) and i don't want it to end. Always wondered why people value things after they lose it, but what if you value something that its real and all you can do is see it crumble :(

My boyfriend worked for four years in the nightlife industry in Vegas. Because of that he has a lot of friends who are pornstars, strippers, webcam girls etc. I didn't know him during that time in his life. We live in California now, and he no longer works in that industry, but his Instagram feed is still full of sexual pics of all these hot girls with little and sometimes nothing on. Tbh I don't mind that he follows the people he knows personally. But he follows a lot of other girls with same sexual content, fake asses and tits, and honestly it feels like a slap in the face. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough. I know I'm not as hot as them but I take care of myself and I look good. I (21) should also mention that he is only 30 and refuses sex more often than not because he's 'too tired'. If I'm lucky we have sex once a week, while he jerks off in the shower every morning. Meanwhile he constantly comments how hot other girls are and jokes about going to strip clubs and smashing his face into titties and asses. 
Basically, I feel like shit. More like his mom, who does his laundry, gives him massages, and fixes his suits. I asked him why he's with me when he could have any of those girls from Vegas. He replied 'because he sees something different in me.' and he supposedly sees a future with me. While that seems like exactly what I should want to hear, I feel like shit that I am not what he lusts after. To be honest, I would almost rather be one of those sex bombs than the potential 'good little wife' I seem to be.

I wish I could talk to him about it but I'm afraid of being labeled as 'controlling'. It seems like something I can either deal with or leave.  I do love him.

t3_chq1g5,My girlfriend is always super rude to me when she gets drunk. How should i deal with this?," 

My girlfriend (23F) is really rude to me (24M) when she gets drunk. It honestly feels like I’m dating a 16 year old. Last night was by far the worst. We are preparing to move across country next week so there is a lot to get done to pack up all of our stuff. Her team at work has just completed a large project and an event was organized to celebrate (concerning to me as every time her work group goes to celebrate I see the same behaviour from her). So as to no surprise this time around, as I spend the entire evening packing up our kitchen, she was out getting absolutely wasted. At around 10pm I hadn’t heard from her in 3 hours. I decided to go for a 20 min run and let her know via text and that I wouldn’t be bringing my phone. I come back from my run to see a bunch of angry messages from her saying “how could you not bring your phone while I’m out drinking?” and that she wanted me to come pick her up.

So I try to call and text her to see where she is so I can come get her but she is totally ignoring my calls/texts. It’s about 10:30 now and I’m feeling exhausted and just want to go to bed, we have to work in the morning and still have a lot to prepare for our move. Over the course of a few hours I wait and continue to do some packing, occasionally trying to call her text her and all I get is some hang ups on the phone. She did answer it once to tell me she was going to a different bar down the street (at midnight) and when I told her it was time to come home she just said she had to go and hung up on me. I could clearly tell she was very drunk.

So I have no idea where she actually is and she stops answering any of my calls/texts. So I go to bed. 2am rolls around and she calls me for a ride. I go pick her up and as she usually is, she’s so rude to me. In my mind I’m understandably frustrated with how the night has gone but she’s so drunk and repeatedly calls me a selfish a\*\*h\*\*\*. She starts telling me my job is a joke and keeps going on and on about how great her work group is, how she got offered a job from a drunk old rich guy who is one of their clients, etc. She refuses to go in the house when we get home because apparently I’m still being an a\*\*h\*\*\*. She eventually passes out in the car, I try to carry her into the house but she wakes up and starts freaking out on me saying I’m hurting her.

We finally get into the house and all she has to say as she walks by the numerous boxes that I’ve packed that evening is “looks like you did f\*\*\* all tonight, literally.” At this point I just can’t believe what’s going on and I start crying and all she says to me is that I’m a f\*\*\*ing joke before she passes out in bed.

This is not the first time that this behavior has happened. It happens every time she goes out drinking without me. And she always gets super drunk. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to say I don’t want my girlfriend to go out and have a good time, her team really did deserve to celebrate after completing the project, but I just can’t take the way she treats me when I pick her up. Not only does she not appreciate at all that I came to pick her up at 2am and spent my whole evening packing while she was drinking, she’s just so rude to me. And we’ve talked about it before but she always plays it off like it’s not a big deal and that she’s sorry and was just drunk. I’m just so broken, I feel like she’s just a totally different person in these situations and it’s hard for me to believe she’s my girlfriend. I don’t know what to do. I know she never acts or says these things sober, but I don't even understand where these thoughts come from when she's drunk.",relationship_advice
t3_chll3c,My (28M) BF suddenly wants premarital counseling before he proposes to me...? (23F),"We have been together for two years.

My proposal isn't really a secret and I know it's happening next month. BF randomly woke me up yesterday at 12AM to demand we go to premarital counseling. Was really caught off guard. We haven't had any huge arguments in the last few months. I don't mind going, but he hasn't really said why he wants to go. He won't ask me to marry me him if I don't go. He already goes to a therapist on his own and he recently saw her.

All he said was: It's his fault for not putting his foot down and letting me walk all over him? Said we needed more boundaries.

This is new to me, and the first that I'm hearing he feels this way. He offers to help me with a lot of things (chores, making my plate for dinner, gassing up my car) and I never turn down the help. I do ask for simple things like this from him but I didn't know it was annoying him that bad. I do much of the same for him without him asking, because he shouldn't have to ask. If I know something needs to be done, I just do it. This isn't a one sided relationship. We both work and contribute equally to our finances and home.

I asked if we could go through with the proposal and make an appointment the week after for therapy. He said no. 

I'm kind of at a loss. I've been extremely anxious at work for the last 48 hours. He's been sleeping on the couch. Will barely say two words to me. This happened out of nowhere and I really don't know what to do or say. I wouldn't be so freaked out if he just told me what the issue is but he is being extremely vague.

I don’t have much income at the moment, he has a great job that pays well and can support us both comfortably. Money is never mentioned unless we have an argument in which “I pay for everything” or “I’m the only person helping you” comes out. He is a great man, but often blunt and honest which can come across rude and insensitive. He tends to repeat negative and hurtful sentences when conversations turn touchy-  today it was about my new business plans! It turned negative after i excitedly told him my ideas and he replied with ""they weren’t working and your business is failing""  I’m not in a good place in general, emotionally and he knows this however it didn’t warrant him to think to reword how he says/said things to me. As he watched me get more emotional he gets more frustrated “ugh god fuck sake, ITS NO WORKING” and repeats everything again to explain himself. “I said your business is failing because it is! Thats the truth! Im being negative because there is nothing positive about this situation, your business is failing, you stuff should be flying off the shelves now!""  
\- I just want plain support, especially after i’ve told you about the positive plans for the future of the business. Just negative comment after negative comment, with the occasional helpful(?) comment like ""Why aren't you getting professional marketing help? Go to some classes!"" Of course by then we are both raising our voices and turns out i'm already looking into classes. ""I paid for this business so i should have a say""  It was all a bit much and i got upset, it didn't feel like he was helping me which he said he was...  


We go round in circles and all i want is to clear the air and have him say sorry i know its a touchy subject, i didn’t mean to make it negative or whatever, but he won’t apologise. He says i just have an inability to talk about anything serious, and yes im emotional, but is it so much to ask that you speak to me with that in mind? Could you be encouraging instead of negative and suffocating? Can't you tell you're upsetting me when there is no need? I completely don't understand where that came from?? Its like he just decided he was going to take this negative route.  
“im HELPING you and this is how you treat me, i will not stand for this. I have never helped anyone MORE in my life”  
Sorry seems to be a really hard word for him to say, but if its black and white, he’ll apologise, like when he smacked my best friends ass.  But if we can argue about something (semantics/unclear), by god he’ll fucking do it. For me, sorry is not a hard word to say. Making someone cry would make me apologise and/or reword, i don’t want to make someone upset so I don’t understand why he can’t do the same???? Im his wife aren’t I? :’(    


When I try to explain my upset he gets incredibly defensive and he throws whatever at me to deflect from the situation. He’ll say im twisting his words and i’m not remembering correctly, it gets vicious and i get hysterical and hurt myself. Once he made fun of my panic attack- “How can i help you when you’re over here shaking like this” (shakes violently with a stupid face) it was so hurtful. I don’t do this for attention, i just work myself up because i want him to understand what i’m saying is JUST PLEASE BE KINDER TO ME but he just can’t understand and argues with me. I sit upstairs crying trying not to hurt myself and i know he hears me but he’s too busy watching TV totally unbothered while Its all I can focus on.   
I have never felt so reduced as a person so weak and pathetic. This happens often.  
 

I’ve felt different about him. How can this be my husband? Why isn’t he there for me when I’m hurting or he sees his words are hurting me? WORDS have weight. When you say I love you I believe you, when you say hurtful things, i believe you until you apologise or attempt to fix the situation. So be honest and kind, Is that so hard to do?  
Any words of wisdom or encouragement would be appreciated. I don’t know what to do,  Am i being completely crazy and overly sensitive??",relationship_advice
t3_chpitw,My boss [40s/F] goes off on me about my [23/F] differing political views and talks down to me. I've had enough.,"So I started this job almost a whole year ago. It's my first time working in a professional/office setting. I do not have a college degree so I am very grateful that I was offered this position, as I realize they are hard to come by without higher education/qualifications/etc. I am the lowest on the totem pole here, which is fine, but my boss (we will call her Mary) is really headstrong and talks down to me because I am a liberal.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I come from is very different than where I live now. My parents are super conservative but I am from a mostly liberal/democratic city, and where I live now is the polar opposite... Mostly everyone here is extremely conservative, love guns/military/Fox News/whatever. I don't assert my opinions on anyone in general, and I'm by no means a ""radical"" liberal if that makes any sense? I don't want to create problems in social settings ever and like I said, my parents are conservative so I grew up with their opinions...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my boss has recently taken on the position of Office Manager and the power seems to have gotten to her head a bit. She can be really rough and kind of mean. I think my kindness has been mistaken for weakness. This morning she went off at me about Trump, and how he is the best president, and all we liberals want is socialism (???) and that Biden is a ""creep"", that Michelle Obama is a man and has an Adam's apple??? -- just really baseless stuff ( a lot that I hear all the time). I seldom speak up, but it's really gross and I don't know how to politely ask her to please stop bringing up politics because she knows I am a liberal and I feel she is antagonizing me and trying to get me riled up.

&amp;#x200B;

I speak my mind hardly ever and I don't appreciate being put down over my views. I don't like being called names like Lib-tard, snowflake, etc. I just want people to be respectful, I am a pacifist and don't agree with war/violence/whatever. I don't know what I am supposed to say because I am sort of afraid of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

We don't have HR, and I don't know our General Manager well enough to say anything. The owner of the company ironically is liberal as well and casually gives Mary shit when he's here, but I don't think it would be appropriate to bring him into this. Does anyone have some advice how I can stand up for myself?

In the past few months, shes been very distant from him and I and even seems to have a problem with him. When I try to talk with her about it, she gets extremely defensive and upset with me. I'm not sure what to do. Am I over reacting? Her distance from me since this relationship is something I havent experienced with her before. We've been friends close to a decade and shes always been supportive.",relationship_advice
t3_chph9v,Should I tell my (21F) ex-boyfriend’s (21M) new girlfriend (18F) that he is still contacting me and trying to sleep with me?,"My boyfriend of 5 years was very abusive to me and so when I was a safe distance from him I broke things off with him. This was 2 years ago and since then he has on multiple occasions contacted me on different platforms, jumping to the next one a while after being blocked, trying to get back with me. He has sent unsolicited nudes, threats of rape, attempted bribes to get me to sleep with him, begging for me back etc.

It died down for almost a full year and I had to practically change my entire identity online. Different name, usernames, being too afraid to post images of myself and the like. I’m going to therapy every week for the PTSD he has given me.

But recently he found my instagram and started it back up, asking to meet up and sleep together as before. I was about to just block him as usual until I saw that he is now in a relationship with someone else. I’ve been sitting on this unsure of what to do. I’ve tried to ask people IRL and was told to drop it and that she won’t believe me even with screenshots. This is purely assumption though as none of them know her at all. 

So, how should I go from here? Should I inform her or just drop it and move on?

t3_chpdww,What do you do when your father is not medically safe to come home from the hospital after a surgery but is refusing all treatment and physical therapy?,"My step father (70M) is an alcoholic, fall risk, anorexic and currently in the hospital recovering from a tumor removal in his mouth. He is also a chronic smoker. My mom works full time and can’t care for him and he is uninterested in caring for himself. He is being discharged from the hospital today and has refused all treatment to include rehab, physical therapy and occupational therapy. We were planning an intervention at the hospital tonight but are now unable to do so. Can my mom refuse to pick him up? What will happen? What can she do tell the doctors he’s unsafe to come home? She is not capable of being his caretaker and he refuses to allow a nurse in to the home. He’s basically slowly killing himself while expecting to be waited on hand and foot. We have talked to the hospital social worker many times who has made it very clear that because he is of sound mind we nor they can force him to do anything. He has no where else he can go.

t3_chpdsa,Wife(36F) was dismissive of my(37M) hobby in conversation and it kind of hurt,"Don't know if I want advice per se, or just to vent. 

TL;DR I shared stuff about my hobby, wife said it's boring, I told her I'm just trying to talk to her about anything

That out of the way...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really into 3D printing right now - I like working on the really technical stuff on 3D printers (like customizing firmware and fine tuning the machine). I'll admit I get into these super technical explanations when I talk about it. I try not to.

My wife is not into it like I am. I respect that. I don't expect her to be into it the same way, or at all. 

The other night while laying in bed and winding down, she's zoned out on her phone again - it's the default each of us take if we've got nothing to do. She works 12+ hours a day, so I miss her and just want to talk to her or watch a show. She's not interested in watching anything at the time (or it didn't seem like it), so I just tried talking to her about anything. My work isn't good and most of the time it's just complaints, so I talked about my hobby. 

I was about maybe two minutes into this when she cuts me off. I can tell she's trying to be gentle, but she's practical so a lot of times it comes out coarse. She tells me that she's trying to listen to what I'm saying, but it's so boring that she can't pay attention. 

This hurt and upset me a bit because she didn't pause to stop playing whatever mindless phone game it was that she was playing to listen, or to tell me this. 

So I told her that I miss her and I just want to talk to her, about anything. I told her I know that my stuff isn't her interest but I was hoping she'd change the subject to literally anything that interests her so we can talk about that instead. I was basically just using my topic as a (admittedly lame) icebreaker. 

She went back to silently playing her game for, I dunno, a couple hours before sleeping. She stays up past me so I don't know how long she's up. I gave up and just went to sleep, hoping that I'd get over it if I slept on it. 

Before I get the kneejerk - I'm pretty sure she's not cheating on me. She's a practical person. The money I make isn't enough to keep her if it came down to it. It's been demonstrated before that if she wanted to leave me, she just would, and there wouldn't be a lot I can do about it. At the same time, it's things like this that make me feel like she's not really engaged in our relationship either. We meaningfully interact maybe twice a week, and the rest of the time is work, kids and sleep. This isn't because of the lack of time; she'd just rather do something else with her free time than something with me. I get that she's tired, but I wish that she wanted to spend time with me with that spare time once in a while. 

So am I being an oversensitive crybaby about this?",relationship_advice
t3_chd288,My Muslim friend told me her husband beats her,"I (f, 21) have a friend from my nursing class named Ava (f, 23). I have noticed bruises on her before but never said anything.

t3_chp6cn,"After 3 years of dating and almost a year of living together, me (26m) and my partner (24f) are going to be living apart because I'm miserable living with their family. Did I make a mistake in deciding this?","TL;DR: I was miserable living with my SO's parents and had to leave, even if it meant putting physical distance between myself and my love, but still feel very conflicted.

The title is kind of a mess, sorry, I'm not very good at titling.

Anyways, for some background, my partner and I met 3 years ago on OkCupid and decided to go on a date. They were a student who normally lived 3 hours away but were attending college in my hometown. Our first date went well and eventually we went into a relationship.

Fast forward about a year ago and my SO is on their last semester and moving into a newer, larger apartment. They ask if I want to live with them, knowing that I am unemployed and have been for a year or two. Neither of us have income, SO has everything paid for by their family, who they tend to have a very rocky relationship with, and I was living with my parents. The plan was that I would get a job and we could save up for something else eventually.

This works well for the college semester but neither of us having savings by the end and we're barely scraping by. SO suggests moving in with their parents to save money. I'm a little unsure but I love my SO and don't want to be apart so I agree.

Now, however, I'm very unsure. Remember how I said my SO had a rocky relationship with their family? Well that's because their family is, by both of our admissions, assholes. Everyone yells at everyone, no one wants to work together and after I quit a job I had for about two weeks due to severe depression, everyone hated me. By Sunday of this week, I couldn't take it anymore. I was having reccuring thoughts of harming myself or others and was severely depressed. I felt trapped in my SO's bedroom and didn't even feel safe in there as anyone could barge in and yell at us at anytime. (And in fact SO's brother did just that a week before and insulted me for driving for Uber while looking for a new job.) To top it all off, we weren't saving any money at all anyways because SO's mom wanted both of us to pay $100 a month, which we had been doing.

I talk to my Mom and ask them for advice and they suggest I should come home and clear my head for a bit. I give it some thought and I agree. I'm unemployed, severely depressed, have no savings, have some minor debt I cannot pay and have no health insurance. I feel like my life is a mess and I feel bad for trying to save up for a life for the both of us when I can't even get my own straight.

I tell my SO this and at first they take it well, saying that they understand, but then we both get really sad. I really worry for my SO because their home life is toxic as hell and they have nowhere else to go. We were both planning on going back to the apartment to clean it up before the lease ends but my SO is sick the day we wanted to leave so they stay behind and follow me down the next day. Since then, they've been crying a lot, saying how much they're going to miss me and that long distance relationships suck. And I agree, I wish it didn't have to be like this, but I feel like I'm a mess and need to get myself sorted.

So I come to ask for advice and thoughts. I feel like I'm making the right decision but I'm so emotionally torn because I love my SO and don't want to be apart. But I absolutely hate living with their parents and it made me miserable.",relationship_advice

What I am going to say happened a few years back and I was not in a position mentally or in any capacity to do anything about it but here is what is happening again.  My H drinks far too much, on the weekend he will stay up almost all night.  A few times I've woken in the middle of the night and hes not home.  I get the excuse I went out to visit so and so (umm at 1am) and your drinking not safe or supposedly he walks to neighborhood.  Frankly I'm done and think this is not behavior of someone married with kids and hes in his early 40s (and had same behavior most of relationship)  also as an aside we live in a family home that needed a major overhaul and it's in complete disarray (picture the worst frat house you have ever been in) I'm almost 40 and dont want to live like that and I have tried to no avail.

t3_chje8n,Should I tell my kids to avoid the family of a disabled kid because of their behavior problems?,"Backstory: long time friends’ son (high school age) lost a limb in an accident (A). “A” touches everyone around him aggressively: hugging without asking, tackling, forced wrestling, arm around necks, poking, he has no concept of personal space with anyone. He is emotionally needy and tends to get belligerent and violent if he doesn’t get his way. 

“A” recently assaulted one of his siblings at a public event and had to be physically restrained. He called his mother and lied to her about the events leading up to him attacking sib. (My kids witnessed, but were not involved in any way.) 

A’s Mom lashed out and, on the phone with her kids, accused all of the group there of “bullying” “A,” saying the only reason why he would have attacked his sibling is because the group was conspiring against him and sibling was the easiest target. 

“A” and his siblings have similar behavior issues. The best way of describing them is like they’re on the ASD spectrum... but without the sound and touch sensitivity issues, instead being completely opposite: loud, bombastic and overly tactile. They seem odd or awkward, but are of average intelligence. Everywhere they go they are like a force of nature.

Their parents scapegoat their kids’ poor behavior onto anyone surrounding them. Mom makes passive aggressive Facebook “call out” posts in which no one is named, but it’s crystal clear who she is talking about and gets hundreds of BS sympathy comments for her “bullied kids.” As far as I can tell, there have been no true cases of them being bullied by anyone. 

“A”s parents are community leaders, have lots of money, and involve themselves in too much. The family is scheduled from 7a to 10p nearly every day during the school year. They’re the type of people who think they have to be in charge of everything. They also have expectations that their children should be high achieving like they are, but don’t seem to see that they really ought to pull back FOR their family instead of doggedly pushing them to do too much and not being present for them. They love their meticulously scheduled “quality time” but didn’t get the memo that kids primarily need QUANTITY time from their parents.

“A” has very few friends. His personality and behavior make it difficult and unpleasant. Most peers actively avoid him. His siblings do somewhat better, but I am getting weary of trying to defend my kids every time their mom goes on the warpath. “A” lied that my son said he wasn’t coming to his birthday party even though he was. I got angry texts from mom, I calmed her down. Best I can tell, “A” loves playing victim because he gets special attention from mom. (Gee, ya think??) Then their kids loudly proclaim to mine that their parents badmouth our family. 

I really don’t want these kids to be friendless. But it’s so tiring. Is it just best to avoid them, or soldier through for the kids sake despite their parents that can’t see THEM, only ideals of them?

TLDR: My kids are friends with the kids of a family with a disabled kid, but their constant behavior problems are wearing us down. Their parents either don’t see their kids’ issues, or actively deflect them onto everyone else.",relationship_advice
t3_chp2gx,I feel like a third wheel in my own relationship.,"I [26M] have been dating my girlfriend [23F] for just shy of 6 months now, things overall are going great. When I hang out with her and my longtime friend, A [26M], he devotes ~80% of his attention/conversation to her. The first time they met months ago she said he looked at her like he hasn’t gotten any in a while (Im pretty sure this was true and might still be). The first few times hanging out I teased her about it “___ is into you, talk to him until I get back [from the bathroom at a bar]”, because he focused almost all of his attention and conversation to her.

When we hang out now he directs about 70% of his conversation to her, occasionally making eye contact with other people, but we almost might as well not be there. Last night, this was the case, but generally all of us were part of it (another one of my friends B was there, 26M), but as the night progressed it became as if it was just my gf and A, and B and I were not even there. I tried to make a few remarks but noticed that A wouldn’t stop talking, and it appeared my gf had ignored me too, albeit A was literally talking in her face.

My gf is very quiet, as am I, and she said she likes that about me, and that some guys just don’t stfu. However, once someone gets her talking she has a lot to say and will keep going as long as they do.

My friend A can talk to literally anybody about anything for any amount of time, he just keeps pulling stuff out of his @$$ to say.

So, it feels that he much more interesting than I am, and monopolizes her attention to the point where she almost ignored me. However she has told me that she could never date someone like him for many reasons when I first mentioned it made me a little uncomfortable a while ago. Obviously they are friendly and A is a cool person to hang with, and she’s a little shy so she likes having someone to talk to if she doesn’t know anyone else besides me (This is the first time she met B, who is also mildly reserved). It’s starting to get really annoying to the point where I don’t want to hang out with my gf and A at the same time, but I don’t have a ton of friends in town anymore that I spend as much time with as I do A. I also fear that he is more entertaining and engaging for her than I am and can’t help but think it’s possible she’d choose him over me, but I think that’s my insecurities snowballing on themselves.

What do I say to gf, or A?",relationship_advice
t3_chmzbu,Should I hate my Aunt and Uncle after they manipulated my grandma into giving them everything?,"My uncle(49m) has been living in a trailer on my grandmas property his entire life. Never paid rent. He met his wife 8 years ago and now they have a 5 year old. 

He hasn’t been able to work in years because he had a heart attack and she can’t hold down a job for more than 2 months. So my grandma has been paying all of their bills and whatever else. 

My grandpa and grandma had a will they made 20 years ago stating that their house and property was to be sold and all of the money should be split evenly between all of their children.

After my grandpa died a year ago, my uncle and aunt wanted to help my grandma draft a new will. My mother(the oldest child) was fine with it as she trusted my uncle.

Turns out my uncle and aunt changed the will so that they get everything when she passes away and when my uncle passes away it all goes to my aunt. They get the house and the property and all of their savings. They said they deserve it because they’ve been “taking care of her” all these years but my grandma gets regular visits from my whole family. 

WE DONT CARE ABOUT THE MONEY. My parents are well off and I have my own career.

The thing is my grandma is suffering from some dementia and they are totally manipulating her. My mother just wants to maintain a good relationship with her mother but now they’ve moved into my grandmas house and won’t answer my moms calls. They’ve kicked her out of her master bedroom and put her in one of the spares. 

My mother is trying to be nice with these people because she loves them but I can’t stand them. I’ve written them letters explaining my frustration. I’ve seen them at a family event since then and they won’t even make eye contact with me. 

Am I right to not want anything to do with them? My mother wants me to invite them to my wedding.",relationship_advice
t3_choyke,How to either move past/ talk to my girlfriend about something that makes me a uncomfortable?,"So let me start of by saying my (21M) gf (19F) is amazing. I love spending time with her and she is always so much fun to be around. For three of the first four months of our relationship, I was constantly busy with school/applying to med school, and she was always super supportive towards me. I just find that I’m always happier when I’m around her. The past couple of months have been rough on her and I’ve tried to be as supportive to her as she’s been to me. 

The only thing that makes me feel uncomfortable is some her friends. As an example; one of her best friends, let’s call him A, is someone that I haven’t really spent much time around. I’ve met him, but that’s about it. However my gf always knows everything about what is going on in his life, like everything. And she’ll also joke along the lines of them being married. She once made a comment about how she could never date him, but it just seems odd to me for her to talk about him like that, especially to me, when we’re dating. Like, I’m her boyfriend and she’ll joke about them being an old married couple, to me. I’m not the controlling or jealous type, and I do trust her. I’m totally fine with her going out with her friends without me or doing whatever when I’m not there. I never feel the need to monitor her for anything other than making sure she’s safe. But for some reason it just makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable. It’s unlike me and I don’t know how to feel about it. 

She’s also not the type to talk about past relationships or anything like that. So I’m not sure she’d tell me if there was something between them, briefly, before she met me. I don’t think there’s anything like cheating going on here, like I said I trust her. I just don’t know what do to. Do I let her know? Is it more of a personal hangup that I need to work through? I just don’t like it and wanted some other opinions. Thanks ahead of time",relationship_advice

t3_chmxu6,I(30M) recently started a new career and I am completely not sure what the f*** am I doing. My GF(27F) is sometimes not very helpful sometimes...,"Recently, I have shifted to IT as my new career. Now I am a programmer, which means I will take a lot of time in my day to perfect my skills or to learn new. It is what it is, I knew it from the day one when the decision was made, so was my girlfriend very aware of the fact that my job will be more time consuming than previous jobs I've had. In fact, 10 months prior to my new employment, after 9-5 job, I would work on my programming skills to get me employed. That generally shifted our relationship towards the time where I don't have time for nonsense stuff. Netflixing all day isn't the option I can take. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am going to be busy to learn as much as I can in a day, but also, I am constantly bashing my head with the ""imposter syndrome"" as my colleagues are outperforming. Even though I try really hard, sometimes my output isn't as good as I thought it would be. I genuinely deliver what's asked from me, but not the way I would want to deliver because there is really a lot to learn, it is a huge field with a lot of stuff you have to chew in order to spit it out the right way. So, after 5, I usually go to the gym to blow off the steam that's in me. After the gym, I feel really relaxed and I am good to learn some more. So what I do is come home, cook some dinner, and then proceed to learn where I left. And that's most of the time last 3 months. Occasionally I'd stay at work one day in a week to work late, with colleagues on our pet projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

What generally kills me is the fact I have become like more 'mechanical'. In our 4 year relationship,  I was terrible with expressing my feelings in general, but now I can't even say how I feel. And that thing generally kills my GF. Another thing is, personally, my goals are set high and I don't want to lower them. On the other hand, she would love to travel. Short story, she's working mentally demanding job in one tech company, but she doesn't have the need to learn out of the work as her job is not of that kind as mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So what is the issue here?** 

&amp;#x200B;

First one is she is dreaming about traveling, while I am dreaming about getting my shit and my career to the point that I can relax for about 4-5 years. Having that said, I am going to sacrifice at least 2 years of my life, so eventually I get to the point I am satisfied. Eventually, I would love to explore the world in a business sense, which means relocating to other companies/countries, possible far away from Europe, while she's consistent with the idea of staying here where we are. I love to work, I have a dream to become a successful entrepreneur, while she has different dreams, and I generally respect her. I have 30 years so I don't have so much time to fuck around.

&amp;#x200B;

Second would be my mental and physical health. Well, I have had a history of drug abuse, alcohol, and other things. Procrastination is also something I am trying to fight off on a daily basis. I generally don't like the idea of going back, so here and there I would try to be disciplined in order to achieve everything I have on my schedule for the day. Well, sometimes I can't do that because she will be angry with my ideas. I cut drugs 7 years ago, and at the beginning of the year, I cut the alcohol. It will cause me severe headaches, and sometimes other problems, so my idea was to kill that habit. Cold turkey. And I did, successfully. I feel great about it, as I know how to have fun without the booze, and she's pissed on me as we knew to get drunk on Fridays and Saturdays to the point we could barely talk. This year we had a lot of 'family' meetings, and here is normal to drink till you get wasted. She was really determined for me to get wasted as she wanted, but I said that alcohol is not an option for me as I try to maintain the life without any vices. Also, I am kind of encouraging her to do the same as I feel the benefits, like not being a couch potato, doing shit that matter and etc., but she'd get all defensive about it, so eventually, I have to shut up as she'd be pissed about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The third is money. It will seem as I am petty, but I have been working since my 15, and I love the fact my life is modest, no matter how big the marketing and influencing pressure is. I have my 'techie things' - a few gadgets. Nothing expensive, and I love it that way.  I worked my ass off before her and during our relationship and I appreciate money, as well as I am aware of the expenses. I do have some savings, but that flowed out since I was the only one paying the rent for 5 months, and basically all expenses. 

The thing that is killing me is a mutual savings account, designed for leisure. I know finances and understand that in terms to grow the savings, I will have to invest the money somewhere so later on in life I can get a mortgage, but her idea is to travel now. Save money and travel. Although I would love to travel and spend money on leisure, my idea is different. I would rather enjoy traveling when I'd be older, and/or traveling for/with work. So generally I have no idea what should I do with that part, as I can't explain that this is generally not my style and right now, when I can work the most, I see it as a waste of potential investment. And that's one of the biggest things she seems to have a problem with. Also, sometimes I get the feeling she thinks that is entitled to my hard-earned money. Meaning, your money is mine as well, while where I have to earn my money, and knowledge, it's my fault I am not taking care and share feelings with her on the sofa. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the stuff mentioned above is not something that is 'relationship breaker', at least not at the moment. To be honest, I am pretty much okay with everything, but from time to time she likes to put an emphasis on these three things mentioned. **Job, drinks, travel/leisure**. Which is not okay as I am working my ass off to have a better life in the future. Sometimes she over-reacts and threatens with a break-up, but then I say that this is not a valid reason to do that, or calm the situation somehow. At the beginning of the relationship, I was a borderline alcoholic, so I had some shenanigans while intoxicated, at a very early stage, but now, when our relationship is more mature it is not common to see that kind of behavior. Especially when it is time to pull our shit up and work it as best as we can.

&amp;#x200B;

What is some general advice you would give for me, overcoming the programming obstacles in life? What would be your next step after reading this? I need something to see if I am maybe too dull to make a clear decision because of all the work, or I am just super chill with the situation. I dunno... assist somehow... Because from time to time I get fed up with all the bullshit and I want to go someplace else where I'd have my own peace and time to work on myself and my skills and career....

t3_chmvh1,My [33/m] girlfriend [31/f] claims the way I managed a breakup 15 years ago contributes to her insecurity and consequent outbursts. Is this fair?,"When I was 19, I landed in a relationship with a girl (Nancy) that I had been long term friends with after sleeping together a couple of times and her deciding to refer to me as her bf. I was never super into her and after a month had met someone else (Annie) that I was genuinely into. Annie lived down the hall from me and was established in my friend group. After a few drunken group nights of mutual flirting, she tried to kiss me on 2 separate occasions. I pulled away both times and told her I had to break up with Nancy first which she accepted.

When I went to break up with Nancy after 2 months total, I found out her best friend had dropped out of university and had moved back to her hometown and Nancy was extremely upset. I decided to be considerate and wait for a better time, which turned into about a month after more drama in her personal life. I never did anything physical with Annie while I was still with Nancy, but did spend time with her in group settings and occasionally alone together when walking back from University etc where I gave her updates about the Nancy situation.

My current girlfriend (Nina) was cheated on quite brutally before me and has issues with my contact with most other girls. I've never done anything to betray her trust, except not give her full access to my phone on demand which she believes she should have the right to because she's happy to give me access to hers. After 8 months she still has trust issues and reacts aggressively to any perceived female threat.

Last night she told me that the way I dealt with Nancy and Annie was morally wrong and is something that contributes to her insecurity and consequent reactions. She says I should have cut all contact with Annie until I had broken up with Nancy. I feel like my actions were morally right because I had to choose the lesser of 2 evils and cutting all contact would have been a major overkill given we lived so close and had the same friend group. 

Am I right to defend my actions in a moral context?",relationship_advice
t3_chmb2n,My boyfriend is only nice when he's drunk,"Stupid random thing I notice about me boyfriend; well he's nice sober but REALLY nice and so in love when he's drunk, like he cant get enough of me and says I'm his BEST friend and he wants to be with me all the time. Then when he's sober he doesn't try to talk to me much or give me attention. Like he's distracted and doesn't care or something. I don't know I'm confused!

t3_chqjmp,Does my older co-worker have a thing for me?,"So, I (25 F) just started this new job and I’ve met this really nice older man (don’t know his age probably early 40s). He’s always smiling at my and always tries to talk to me with every chance he’s got. At first I thought he was just being friendly until he started getting more bold. A few days ago he called me gorgeous and asked if we could be friends on Facebook. Ever since then he’s been messaging me on Facebook about how my days have been going and how sweet he thinks I am. He’s dropped subtle hints about getting together outside of work but nothing too obvious. 

I always catch him smiling and waving at me while at work and when he talks to me he’s always happy. He also tends to lean in while talking to me and will sometimes hover his hand over my back (nothing inappropriate at all). 

I’m interested in him as well so whenever I’m by him I always stutter, blush and get very nervous and he definitely notices. He’ll wink when he smiles at me and always calls me things like “good girl”, “young lady”, or “lil lady” but it’s never in a condescending tone.

Long story short, is he just trying to make me feel welcomed and comfortable since I just started working there or is he trying to show me that he really likes me?",relationship_advice

She’s really nice, not the type to just blow you off, if you talk to her she’ll have a conversation with you. This happens every time we go out together and I just stand awkwardly while these guys are so obviously hitting on her and she’s having a full blown convo. 


How can i handle this situation? Also i should mention that she’s not really the romantic type, i don’t think she’s ever had a serious bf and i wouldn’t be surprised if she’s a virgin or only had sex like once

t3_chqi52,Investing too much into someone,"The easiest way to explain is that I'm putting all my eggs into one basket and getting upset when the basket starts to break - or running away when I get the lingering impression it might be.

Maybe I'm just stupidly anxious, I dont know.
And I realise it also makes me sound incredibly intense, but wait two secs for me to explain. 


This happens whenever I start dating again and is the reason I swore I wouldnt.

But friends recently set me and another of their friends up and we clicked pretty instantly. There wasnt any awkward silences and we've been chatting damn near constantly since. It's been a few weeks now and it's pretty solid into that shit awful ""honeymoon"" phase or whatever its referred to.

t3_chqi02,Two perfect girls,"I'm a 16 y/o male and I'm in a pickle, about two years ago a friend asked me who my crush was I honestly didn't trust him to keep it to himself so I told him a different girl. About a month or two later he told me that someone asked him who my crush, that person was my actual crush who I'll refer to as L, L is very nice, pretty and very intelligent we've lived in the same neighborhood for as long as can remember, we go to the same church at the same time and I occasionally see her at church or other activities but I never really talk to her. My friend told her who he thought I had a crush on, so me being a dumb 8th grader thought I needed to act. I recruited a different friend to tell L that I liked her meanwhile I put a letter on her seat on the bus, I planned this to be on her birthday the letter basically went like this: I like you, try to find out who I am. I'll send you a letter every month. I thought this was a good idea although I never actually wrote another letter. The next day L was absent from school and one of her friends asked me if I liked L and wrote the letter I denied it. About a month later L's  brother asked if I wanted to know who L's crush was, scared that it wasn't me I said no. In hindsight that might have been a bad idea. Summer passed and I never really saw her. Then in 9th grade I saw a lot more of her but I didn't have a class with her until the second trimester. Our teacher as a get to know you question asked if I had a crush on anyone in the class I said no. Nothing really happened until the end of the year, I wrote in her yearbook: I'm sorry about the letter. I meant about how I gave it not the intent behind it. Sophomore year rolls around and I still like her but honestly I'm to scared to talk to her so what I thought was a good idea was to ask for another friends help, she really likes matchmaking people and we both been in as many of the school plays and musicals as possible I'll refer to her as A. One day A asked who everyones crushes were so she could help and I told her L. Later in the year I realise that I've developed a crush on A. And I start talking to her more I dropped a few hints that I liked her, I found her crush but she won't make a move on him because her friend also has a crush on him, I really enjoy her company, but recently when I walk past L in the hallway she smiles and waves or says "" hi"" and I realise that I really like both of them. In May senior ball was coming up and I asked what she would do if I asked her to the dance, she kind of brushes it off then asks me to take one of her other friends instead because her friend doesn't a date yet. I accepted but a few days later I told her I couldn't do it, I gave the excuse that I didn't know her friend very well and it would have been awkward she said she understood. At yearbook signing I wrote a compliment to her. It's now summer and I'm over thinking everything I've done, thinking if all the wrong ways it could be interpreted so I decided to go to the innternet, what should I do? do I even have a chance with either after all the dumb stuff I've done?

t3_chj628,Boyboyfriend shoved me during an argument last night,"So yesterday my boyfriend, his brother, and I all decided to go out for gyros. My boyfriend said he’d cover me, and I asked him if he was sure, I let him know I’d just have to go grab cash from my place. He reassured me and told me that it was okay and he would pay. So flash forward, we’re next in line and he points to something on the menu and asks if that’s what I’d like, I said yes, so he goes to order the food, he asks the lady for his gyro and a baklava, then she asks if that’s it and my boyfriend says yup pays for his meal puts his wallet away then turns to me and says what are you getting? Pretty embarrassing to feel like your boyfriend isn’t even willing to hold up his promise on buying a gyro. (If I sound like a needy bitch, keep in mind I pay for most of the dates that I have to beg him to go on with me) anyway so we go home and I make myself some ravioli, and we go to watch a movie. So I turned the over head lights off and left our spring lights on and go to turn on the tv. Well the HDMI cord is unplugged so I asked someone to hand me my phone so I could use the flash to plug it back in. To with a got a reply of “girls don’t know what they want” or “girls really can’t decide if they want a light on or off” any way so I turned to my boyfriend and jokingly said that if girls are so difficult that he should date a guy. He totally freak out and started shouting “IM NOT GAY, IM NOT A F**, IM NOT ATTRACTED TO GUYS, THATS A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY” etc. while he’s yelling at me I’m trying to tell him that it was a joke and nothing to be upset about, so he started telling me to shut up and be quiet and when I wasn’t he proceeded to shove me once while shouting to shut up, then he did it again harder while shouting. So this morning I broke up with him and left but he’s saying I overreacted about all of this and all his friends are agreeing and idk what to do now...

Update - thank you to everyone who reached out to me. It’s been a difficult night of trying to talk to him and he told me he wants me to wait for him, only so I can better myself, then this morning posts something saying how horribly I treated him and to hit him up now that he’s single. My heart kinda hurts because after driving him to and from work for a whole year and spending so much time and money planning out dates that he complained about and would drag his feet throughout. Yet for some reason I’m still really hurt, I know we broke up but like idk ig I thought I wasn’t that bad.",relationship_advice
t3_chqfu8,My boyfriend lied about not being a virgin and about all his girlfriends before me?,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months, and I'm 99% sure that he lied about not being a virgin and about all of his exes. He hasn't admitted the truth to me yet, but I just know he is lying. He told me he had sex with 3 girls before me (one, he said, was a girl from class, another was his ""ex-girlfriend,"" and another was a girl he had ""friends with benefits with""). He's lied about this kind of thing before... and I've gotten enough hints that he lied about this too. 

I haven't confronted him or anything yet. I understand why he did it. I think he felt intimidated because I have had many boyfriends before him including one very serious relationship that lasted 3 years. We were 18 years old when we met, so I understand how it can be embarrassing if he had never had a girlfriend before me and that he was a virgin. My only worries are the following:

1) He is easily able to lie to me. That worries me. Does he not see a future with me? I feel like boyfriends only lie to their girlfriends if they don't think their lies will ever be found out. I really care about him and want to be with him. But he is willing to lie so easily to me. Why?

2) If he was a virgin before me then could this explain his ""love"" for me? Does he not actually love me? What if he only cares so much about me because I am his first sexual partner and first girlfriend? What if his love for me isn't real? 

I just feel like this changes the whole dynamic of our relationship. I thought he loved me because he had girlfriends before me and realized we get along the best. What should I do? Should I confront him? Anyone's advice/opinions are greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_chqeuv,Me[32m] having issues with stepdaughter [22] female not contributing at all.,"I got together with my wife[42f] 13 years ago. She had 2 kids from earlier relationship. Both of them did not contribute to much household when they grew up, wich i did not have a problem with since they were kids. The youngest [18f] has been living for herself while studying  in a nearby city since she was 16. We contribute with some money, but she also get money from the state for living away from parents, just enough to pay rent and food. She has become pretty much independent allthough  she comes home to us allmost every weekend. But when she comes home, she contributes with doing dishes, washes her own clothes, has a part time job ect. 

The eldest daughter has also moved out 2 times. The last time together with her sister. Both times she moved home after 6 months. She struggles with depression, and has done for many years, so i get that she feels more safe at home. The problem is she never contributes with anything at home. Same story when she lived with her sister. But for some weird reason thinks she does a lot if she emptied the dishwasher 2 weeks ago and washes her own clothes every 14. day. She is getting help dealing with her depression seeing her shrink and hanging out with friends. She had a job, but it was to stressfull for her condition, wich I am conpletely fine with. She does receive some money from beeing unemployed, but she does not contribute with any money, not when she had a job and not now. When i bring it up with her, she does not want to talk about it, is too tired or answers with an attitude. Also when i bring It up, it stresses the hell out of my wife , cause of the atmosphere it creates in the house. She does help out with watching our youngest[3] from time to time, but it is often a struggle when asking her to help. Mostly because her little brother is very active. 

So what should i do to get her to just contribute with daily stuff in and outside the house. And not make it a struggle each time when asking her for any help.

t3_chqekd,GF cheated on me. Should I forgive her?,"Hello all, made this account for the sake of this post.

Yesterday, I (25M) was hanging out on my girlfriend's (21F, let's call her Laura) new room (she changed college so she moved closer to her future classes and also farther away from me. For context, this is a shared flat with 2 other girls and she moved in 3 weeks ago. ) when she asked me to tiddy the trash bin and get it ready to throw the trash away. As I picked the bag I saw a used condom case in there and I stopped and asked about because surely it wasn't mine. She confirmed it was from a guy (let's call him Jake) she is taking dance classes with and I started crying, a lot.

At the moment and before I knew about this we were going through a rough patch, starting in march she started to distance herself very slowly and it got to a point where she wasn't putting any effort on our online/text communication. By the end of May/start of June I was starting most of our interactions and decided we should talk, This talk happened mid June and she told me she wasn't sure she loved me anymore. It hurt me but we agreed on trying to make things better (I gave her more space and tried not to pressure her too much). Our sex life also declined starting around April but that wasn't/isn't even my concern compared to the whole relationship.

Around March aswell she started getting private dance lessons with a very good teacher and Jake. Jake was paying for the lessons as he was the one interested in the first place and because he needed a follower he invited Laura. They were taking 1 class each week since march and rarely 2 classes a week. She has also gone out with him a couple of times to dancing bars. Before all this started I actually supported her on this because she loves dancing, she would get to improve her skills and for free.

Coming back to yesterday, Laura said she wants to be with me and that she is really sorry and feels lost, does not love me as she once did and she started to like Jake. She said they had sex around 7-8 times since mid June and this is what broke me the most, imagining Laura on her new bed (which I carried 3 floors up), doing all kinds of stuff with Jake behind my back not once, not twice, but 7-8 times. While this was taking place my birthday went by, her birthday went by, family events went by and she was there with me like our only problem was she losing her feelings for me. I feel disgusted, betrayed, sad, angry and everything in between. How could she let it get to this point? We had a really good relationship up until march (almost 2 year long). We visited countless places, she slept on my house (live with parents) countless times (and me at her parents'), everybody on her and my family knows me and her personally. I gave 110% to her and I really believe i was a really good boyfriend always up for anything and ready to help her whenever, wherever.

I then told her if I am to accept and to heal from this, she needed to talk to Jake and tell him to stop everything. I was NEVER possessive of her nor I told her who she should hang out with and I felt wrong doing this but i viewed it as necessary, judge me as you please.

While i was writing this she just called me and asked for space and time to choose if she wants to continue our relationship or not and that she believes she should have dealt differently, also that she spoke to Jake and, to my shock, she implied there might even be a chance of she ending up with him. Not that this is a reason not to have a relationship but he is almost 20 years older than her, he hops country each few years and from what she told me 2 or 3 months ago he has plans to change countries soon. She is going to keep studying here and it feels so incompatible.

From my perspective, I think as she was losing interest in me, she tried to distance a bit and ended up developing a relationship with this other guy before even talking about the problem. It makes no sense though, giving attention to someone else in hopes of someday fixing our problem... but it is done.

Also a note, before I ever had a relationship and even during ours I told her that cheating is instant breakup but reddit, I pussied out. I couldn't do it on the spot even though I feel absolutely devastated and broken.

So here it is, I'm inclined to break up, Laura messed up before attempting to solve anything with me first and I think I'm just hoping for someone out there that could show me a silverlinning or even a different perspective that would help me decide to try and save the relationship our if this is a total loss. How should I proceed?

t3_chqchc,I drunkenly cheated on the girl I love more than anything (M22) (F21),"Hello everyone, thank you in advance for taking the time to help me out.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I are in a somewhat long term relationship; more than 3 years now. I have a history of cheating (a couple times with other people a long time ago), but never once did I consider doing so with this girl. I truly and honestly love her and want to stay with her forever.

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, lately we have been having trouble with affection even kissing sometimes. Her new depression medication makes it a struggle for her to be ""in the mood"" very often. We have talked about it already and I told her there is no reason for me to make her feel pressured to do something she doesn't feel like doing. It was an honest answer and I really don't have a problem with getting less affection from her as long as she still loves me. It was sort of hurting me since I felt unwanted, but less-so after we talked; and through all of this I was still more concerned about her mental well-being as that was a priority over my own insecurities.

&amp;#x200B;

While it is not by any means an excuse, I honestly feel it is worth saying that I think this may have played into my lapse of judgment; simply for the sake of sharing my objective thoughts. That feeling of being unwanted doesn't go away. It's something I ignore, and usually do a good job of because I have no doubts that we love each-other wholeheartedly.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, I had to cancel plans with my girlfriend to spend time with my friends who I forgot I made prior plans with. (We had discussed that mix-up as well and I will start using a calendar to keep track of my plans so she doesn't feel ignored.) She was invited to be with all of us, but was not feeling up to it, and may have been a little depressed at the time. The plan was for me to play a few drinking games with my friends, then go visit my girlfriend. I had gotten too drunk to drive at one point, then told her and she said it was fine and to just come over in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I had stopped worrying about how much I drank and decided to just relax and have fun. But clearly became too drunk. I started making out with one of our friends on and off over the course of about 20 minutes, and went down on her for about 5 seconds, stopped, and left to go lie down somewhere else. (I have no feelings for her at all). I immediately felt disgusted and just pretended to sleep until everyone left.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to entirely blame the alcohol. I know that no matter how impaired my judgment is, it's still my fault. However I know 100% I never would have done this sober, or even less drunk. I feel awful, disgusted with myself and can't think straight or get my work done. No matter what I am going to tell her this weekend, but I want to do it right.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance for anything you can recommend. I've given as much detail as I can think of and will add more if I think of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Removed a useless detail

&amp;#x200B;

Edit2: I appreciate any advise that you can give, but i am not looking to be told what i did was wrong. I already know that. There is no way to justify anything I did and I have nothing but myself to blame I suck, i'm stupid, and i've wasted her time. Please save yourself the time if that is all you have to add. I am looking for any advice on whether there is a right way to tell her. I want to be honest and open with her out of respect i truly do have for her.

t3_chqa31,"I suggested my so look at the roster for an upcoming tattoo convention, and now he’s convinced that I am shaming him for not having tattoos.","He has expressed an interest in them before (veeeery fleeting, just a mention of “that would be a cool tattoo” every few weeks), and mostly has stated he’s scared to get one because even a good artist can fuck up. I am pretty tattooed, and actively talk about how much I love that kind of art. But I don’t NEED my partner to be tattooed, is more something I like for myself.

Today I noticed there was a tattoo convention coming to my area, and I was kind of excited since tattoo artists from all around the world are coming. Off handedly, I mentioned that my SO should look at their roster and see if there’s an artist he likes (since these artists will only be here for a limited time and many of them are from other countries).

He immediately blew up. He started telling me he was wondering when I’d start pressuring him to get one, and that if I wanted a tattooed man I should just go fuck someone else.

Mind you, I really don’t consider tattoos when I date someone. I just really like them on myself. I tried explaining to him that I was just suggesting he look at the artists since he had expressed his insecurity in finding the right one before. That I didn’t NEED him to get tattooed at all, let alone at this convention.

He started crying and telling me to fuck off. He exclaimed: “How would you like it if I went ‘hey so they are selling discount gym memberships, how about we go so you can lose weight’?!?!” 
That really kind of hurt, and I’ve been trying to see it from his perspective since then. I really don’t feel that strongly about wether or not he’s modified. I just...idk. It seems I really damaged his self esteem and how attractive he feels, but he won’t believe me when I tell him that I wasn’t trying to pressure him to get a tattoo.

t3_chjooq,I (21F) stopped seeing a guy (31M) because he was in a long-term open relationship,"Me and this guy met on OkCupid two years ago. I was upfront that I was looking for something casual and fun; he wanted the same and we seemed to be both into each other so we started texting off the app. Although my main motive for this was something sexual, he and I would have pretty long conversations. This was pretty unusual for someone I just wanted to hook up with, but we both liked talking to each other.

We finally met in person and had sex. It was clear that we both liked each other and he asked me if I was seeing anyone regularly, I replied ""no"" and he also said ""no."" After that, we would meet a couple more times. He later mentioned that he had a female roommate and casually mentioned that they used to date and would get back together soon. He explained that they were on a break for the summer and previously had an open relationship together. The next time I saw him, he had moved into a new apartment with this girlfriend and they were continuing their open relationship. I had never slept with someone in an open relationship, so I didn't think too much of it.

We would continue to see each other. One time felt particularly intimate that when I went away for university, he texted me, saying that he really missed me and that the sex felt very intense and romantic. We would continue to talk long-distance and he called me, out of the blue, for solace after he and his girlfriend broke up. (They got back together a week later) I naïvely continued talking to him, because I liked him and I liked the sex.

We saw each other a couple more times until some time later, he would tell me that he couldn't see me in the near future since his girlfriend didn't want an open relationship at that time. I felt terrible and honestly hurt. I cried it out and in the months that passed, life went on. He texted me months after we had talked, asking me if I was in town: I wasn't. He texted me again a couple months later, trying to say hello and make conversation, not really mentioning the last conversation we had. I just made polite conversation before I said bye.

He texted me again when I was back home and asked if I was back. I told him I wasn't interested in speaking to him anymore. I feel that this was more intimate than a casual hookup, but not moving towards anything else so it was best to end it.

Is it best to end these kinds of relationships?

t3_chq7ps,My (16M) Ex (15F) is trying to come back into my life.,"We dated pretty seriously for 2 years. Of course we are younger so we hung out alot at school and we had sports and other things todo. Hung out about 2 or 3 times a week (not in school)

But here's the story:

First day of summer she breaks up with me over text. There is a lot to it, but she did me wrong. She went to parties all week and did other things. I also believe she met another guy and started talking to him too (I don't think they even kissed). She told me she just lost love for me, but I feel that she didn't want to be restricted to me.

I took it pretty hard. I cried, my stomach was in a knot, and I wanted to text her so bad. I texted her and I was just like ""What even happened"" ""Why can't we talk about this in person"" and other questions because I was so upset. 

That was about a month and a half ago and I've stayed away from her since. I still think of her, and still going through the break up process. But I've kind of forgotten about her. 

So one night ago she texts me at 3 AM and then deletes the DM (I could see the notification, but not the whole message). I wake up and check my phone and I'm like stunned. I was honestly shaking a little bit. I thought this was over.

I text her ""what"" and go on with my day. She wakes up a few hours after me and she tells me she felt lonely and she was crying, but she's okay now. I ended up giving her advice and she opened up to me a little bit. 

So right now, this is how I'm guessing she feels:

She doesn't know if she wants me back, but she misses me being around because I cared about her. I treated her so well and really gave my all for her.

I feel:

So confused. I've been going through the break up process and she did me wrong. But I miss her too and I kind of want her back.

I know right now I could block her and not have to think of this anymore, but at the same time I feel that we could really build up our relationship again. I feel like if we got back together, it would take weeks of rebuilding and lots of change would have to happen. I love how I have space now, and I'm not worried about anyone. But I feel like I could have some space and her too. 

I guess I should add this in too; I have done alot for myself since the break up. I've lost 10 pounds and I've been working out a ton. I've also been hanging out with my guy friends alot and building those relationships more too.

t3_chq7ke,Am I going to regret not wanting to be around my family?,"I come from a dysfunctional family. No one in my family likes each other and the way they communicate is through arguing and bitching. We had the last ""family vacation"" ever a few months ago. I knew in my gut that I shouldn't have went and it ended disastrously and violently. I want nothing to do with my parents and brother. They are violent, angry people and don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. I get depressed being around them. I have told them in the past that I was suicidal only to have it thrown in my face during every argument like ""maybe if you did something with your life you wouldn't want to kill yourself"" and ""get up off your lazy ass, no wonder you are depressed and try to make everyone else miserable"" and similar things like that.

I guess my question is for anyone who came from a dysfunctional and abusive family and decided to distance themselves. Would I regret it? We're supposed to be close to our families and ""cherish"" the short time we have with them but I honestly just resent them and they lead me to suicidal thoughts because they remind me that I am alone in this world and nobody truly cares about me. They have their ""good"" moments but those are outweighed by the bad. I don't like talking to them at all because it leads to a fight 99% of the time. Should I distance myself from them and possibly not speak to them in my later adult years?",relationship_advice
t3_chodbr,Will I be wasting my time?,"I'm a 20 (21 in November) year old girl from Europe. For a bit over a year I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend (21). He's Australian. We love each other a lot and I'm really happy with him. However, he told me that he doesn't think he could be happy living in any other country bit Australia. That's fair enough, a decision everyone has to make for themselves. I could technically see myself living in Australia permanently. But I'm not sure yet. For my uni course I have to study abroad for one semester and since I love Australia I'll do it there. This will be start in January. My bf and I want to take this as an opportunity to see if we work out if we live together in day to day life and I will see if I can actually see myself living in Australia. The longest I've been there so far was 2 months. 
However, I've become more and more doubtful in the last few weeks. I love my family and my country and Europe in general. So what if I move to Australia and after a few years I realise it's just not for me and go back? I'm scared that I'll hate myself for having ""wasted"" time then. On the other hand I really do love my bf and I can see a future with him and things could work out. I don't want to have any regrets or what ifs later on in my life. 
I'm also known for self sabotaging because I always think and think and when I think something is worth giving a shot I think some more until I think no and then I think more until I'm so confused that I don't know what I want and should do anymore. I don't want to have regrets or what ifs but neither do I want to waste time. But is it really time wasted if it doesn't work out? I could see it as a good and valuable life experience. I just don't know what to do? Will I be wasting my time?

t3_chocth,Can a relationship or marriage last without “the look”?,"You know what I’m talking about, that gaze where you guys just kinda melt and it feels like you’re in a bubble together, and without saying anything you can just feel how much the other person loves you.

In two of my other relationships I experienced “the look” I was talking about. It felt so good to connect with someone in that way. I don’t want to throw away a good relationship over something so small.. or is it actually something big? I just don’t know. What if I break up with him and then I’m just chasing this “look” and don’t even find it with anyone else and I could have had a good life with my current boyfriend?

t3_chq3uf,Girlfriend posted pictures with her ex on Instagram,"My [19M] gf [19F] and I have been dating for 8 months. Things are awesome, however this last weekend my girlfriend let me know that she would be seeing her ex.
 
This is the text messages:

Her: ""btw I'm going to meet with (ex) on Friday. He's ... I think he's on crack""

Me: Okay thanks for telling me I hope he's okay

Her: Same, I thought I'd let you know. He's drugged out that's all I can say. I'll find out when I see him. He looks ill and I hate him for it. I really think he needs a genuine talk.
 
After that we played an online game together and went to bed.
 
I don't really know what they did Friday; it's not really any of my business, but she did mention that she rewatched a movie in theater that we had seen. Anyways, the next day she uploaded photos to her Instagram of her and him from the night before. They weren't touching or anything, the photos were them individually not together. Even so, I felt a little uncomfortable. Yesterday, on her Instagram for her music, she released an old photo of her and her ex. I'm guessing it's prom photos from their senior year of high school. She looks nice in it and I imagine that's what she would say if I asked why she uploaded it. This picture made me very uncomfortable as he had his hand wrapped around her waist.
 
Their breakup was very one sided. He would often text her saying that he loved her while we were dating/fwb. What's a bit puzzling is that she said he came out as gay to her and I believe it (reasosn I believe it that I won't bother explaining). I've met him a couple of times, once at a party. The entire time we were at the party she clung to me but he would drag her away and was very jealous towards me (still while we were dating/fwb). Once we began our relationship I told her he needed to stop so she sent him a text that she's not single and he needed to back off. I don't know if they hangout or how often. I don't know how much they communicate or how often. I don't even care, honestly. What I do know is that seeing the picture of her and him together made me very uncomfortable. Communication is key and I'll certainly bring it up the next time I see her. I would just like to hear my fellow redditors thoughts or advice.",relationship_advice

Hello there, I'm in need of some advices...

I've noticed that my girlfriend is starting to get a litle nervous everytime I ask her, hers phone just to take a picture of her.

There's a guy thats calls her every month when we are out of town, and 3 days ago, she woke up at 6:45 and texted her mother just saying: ""Don't worry, I'm okay"", her mother called me 2 hours later asking if I knew where she was, I told her I didn't. Later she called her mother and then me to say that she was okay and went to a girl friend in need.

At this point, I was nervous and started to getting  suspicious about this. She told me everything was okay and promised me that she wasn't where another dude.

This morning, the asked me to look at her phone for setting an alarm, and the phone was locked on some messages from that guy who sometimes calls her and I saw the text from him ""So, did you enjoyed?"" and her awnser ""Yes, I did and you?"".

I don't know what to do, it feels so bad in my mind, I wish I haven't seen that, I don't want to just talk to her and say ""I saw your text's"". I don't know what to do....

t3_chq1ml,"my cousin called me “stupid” and a “fuck up” on a holiday that my side of the family paid for, what do I do?","Sorry for grammatical errors, not my first language. 

So my cousin, Mathéo,(22m) and I (20m) were heading home to Toronto from the Sydney Airport. We get a taxi about two or so hours before our flight leaves, traffic was beyond terrible. We end up missing our flight, so I say, “I’ll try to find a new one. This is okay, we will find a new one soon.”

Mat starts to get super pushy and starts to complain how this is entirely my fault. I had paid for his ticket and mine, so I guess in his mind it was all on me. I can’t control traffic or the airline company. I decide that if I get pushy with him back, he’ll explode at me. So I sit there, on my phone trying to find tickets back home. As I’m spending an extra 3,500 CAD to get us our flight home, he loses it and tells me that I’m a “fuck up” and that I’m stupid. I’m taking all of his insults to not start a fight with him. 

I decide to make a quick email to our family and friends, letting them know that we are going to be home later than expected and not to worry. Mat sees this email due to his mother asking about it. He tells me that I’m acting rude, careless, and not being considerate with how he is feeling. He has a fiancée at home and a kid, so he wants to see them as soon as possible. I have a family too, whom I miss. I was being calm so I could think. He then insinuated that the reason I wasn’t visibly upset was that I don’t care for my family. He knows my family well and knows fully well that two of my family members have rare neuron destroying illnesses that have shortened their lifespans, but he told me that I don’t understand what it feels like to worry for anyone except myself. This was when I decided to defend myself, because he decided to take a jab at my side of the family.

I tell him that there was traffic and that it wasn’t my intention to miss the flight, flights are missed all the time. I tell him that his anger is misdirected at me and that I will have him on a flight soon. I tell him that I’m going elsewhere for now and that he needs to calm. I remind him that the family he decided to badmouth, spent over 3,000 CAD (plus the tickets) for him to have a free holiday.

We get on our new flight, barely an hour and a half hours later. I apologize for forgetting to remind him to check his boarding pass the day before and I apologize for being calm, I explained that I needed to be calm in order to get a new flight and that missed flights occur all the time. He says, “Yeah.” And then looked at the ground without saying anything. 

On the flight, he played it off and acted like we were completely fine. He told me jokes and I laughed and we had some good conversation. It felt normal, but in the back of my mind all I could think about was how rude he was to me. I usually say that things like this are just water off a duck’s back but I honestly still feel very hurt.

It’s been about five days and he hasn’t said any single “thank you” or “I’m sorry” to me after everything. We had a good two and a half weeks to explore Australia, it was really incredible. But I feel wounded by his words that he told me at the airport. Is there any way I can solve this or get him to at least apologize? I just want to know if he resents me or if our relationship is ruined. 

To me, it felt like he was using the simple issue of missing the plane ride as an excuse to dig into me and let me know how he’s really been feeling about me.",relationship_advice
t3_cho9hl,I spilled water on my friend's hidden laptop. How much should I compensate her?,"I was at a friend's house and I accidentally knocked a [stand like this](https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_d45241a7-7e82-4e3f-80db-5895fec03d54?wid=488&amp;hei=488&amp;fmt=webp) with a cup of water on it in the living room. It turned out that another friend was charging her laptop hidden under the couch next to the stand, and water got onto her laptop, damaging it. The estimated repair cost of the laptop far exceeds what the laptop was worth right before the spill.

What's appropriate to pay my friend? Obviously I'm at fault for spilling the drink, but I also feel like my friend definitely shares part of the blame because she both placed her laptop in an area where drinks are likely to be spilled and also hid it under the couch.

t3_chpzm7,"I (m/29) have been with my wife (f/28) for 5 1/2 years. Through years of lies/deceit/gaslighting, we’re filing for divorce today.","Brace yourselves it’s gonna be a long one. At the end of it, I’d like to know other’s thoughts on where we as a couple fucked up, especially me, so that for any possible future relationships I’m in I’ll be a better partner. 

Ever since the beginning of our relationship, my wife has kept in touch with several men whom she says are just old friends and people she likes to stay in touch with. When we were first dating, it wasn’t a big deal, she has her friends I have mine. It wasn’t until after I saw that several of those guys made their intentions known that they showed interest in her and wanted more, that I started getting upset at the idea. Every time I would bring it up, because it happened all the time, she would say that I’m being crazy and blowing things out of proportion. That they were just friends. Some of these guys asked for help on “knowing where to get a blowjob” or when she asked her ex “do you think I’m still attractive?” (Right after having our first child kind you) his response was “10/10 would want”. There are literally too many occasions to count where she has had similar interactions with other guys, with the same response of the initially hyper defensiveness then explosiveness toward me saying I’m being controlling and I’m crazy to think any of this is inappropriate because “it’s not like I’m sleeping with any of them. Keep in mind, several of the strictly platonic girl friends I had at the beginning of our relationship whom I would never text or dm or anything like that, I had to cut off contact/delete numbers/unfriend because she somehow felt threatened by them when they would like pictures/posts of mine and because a few were pretty. I kid you not, we were at a mutual friend’s 4th of July party and one of the girls she had a particular jealousy of, I INTENTIONALLY avoided the entire night, said hello to me as we were leaving. Her response was to fight with me as soon as we got in the car, and cry the entire way home because we “were making eyes at each other”. That being said, fast forward to about 3 years into our relationship, roughly 1.5 years married (I know, I’m dumb) we have our daughter and think of plans for a second. This is after that text I saw from her ex, and we agreed that she would cut him off and unfriend/delete his number because if there was gonna be an “us” there couldn’t be a him. Things are going well, we’ve since bought a house, have a perfect child. Life is good. Then one day I see she’s friends with him again on facebook and IG and they’re liking each other’s posts. She’s the type that likes to post gym selfies, because hey, she has a great body why not. I tell her I noticed they’re interacting again and I’m like “bruh wtf”. She tells me that I need to calm down that there’s nothing between them. Now I forgot to mention that this guy is military and he’s stationed in England, but he’s from the same city so maybe like once every year or two he’ll be in town. So I felt( whether rightfully or not) hurt again, and made an issue of it. I was pissed. I broke a picture frame of ours and slammed a couple doors. It’s at this time that my wife says she’s scared of me and that I’m being abusive because of my temper. Now, to this day I have NEVER laid a hand on my wife or my kids but I have had the occasional flare up when this kind of thing happens. At this point we both agree to start marriage counseling, and soon after I agree willingly to start anger management. We have a baby together and I’m not letting her grow up in a household of an angry parent. My parents did it, I’m not going to. Things are ok between us. It’s amazing what time can do and what it feelings it can subdue. We now have a second child. At this point we’ve come to a compromise about her talking to her ex/other men. She has a lot of issues in her past that make this particular case challenging. It’s confirmed with our therapist so after understanding, the compromise is that she can have her friendship (albeit an inappropriate one) as long as I don’t see it. Out of sight out of mind. I didn’t want to be the controlling spouse so we figured this was the best way. Bruh, I was wrong. 

Fast forward to about a year ago. She works with CPS and has for several years. Well at work there is this guy in another department who she tells me is funny and that they’re friends. At first it’s like, cool story bro. Well after hearing about this guy every once in a while it starts bothering me. Her behavior is slowly changing, she’s more secretive with her phone, our intimacy drops dramatically, she starts getting a new wardrobe to the tune of several hundred dollars. Yeah that’s USD folks (keep in mind she is the most frugal person I know and the entire time we’ve been together she’s maybe spent $100 on new clothes.) and has since decided she wants to transfer departments. To which one? Oh you know. Buddy buddy’s department. I address all of these things. The phone? It was agreed we wouldn’t snoop through each other’s things, so she keeps it passcode locked. Intimacy? We have 2 very young children and we’re both full time workers. Completely understandable. Wardrobe? It’s so she can feel better about herself because again, it makes her feel nice. I get it she deserves to, she’s a mom. All moms deserve that. I still show some hesitancy toward that one though because honestly, if you guys knew her it’s probably the most out of character for her. Even her mom brought that one up. The job transfer? Admittedly, she did tell me from the beginning of her career that she’s always wanted that job but a spot just finally came up. I tell her I understand all of those things more or less individually, but ask if she just look at the whole picture from my perspective and that it looks pretty suspect. She agrees it does, but tells me that I have nothing to worry about. It’s at this point I feel it’s on me to be a more supportive husband and help make sure the load on her is less. I start doing more around the house (I’m already the one that makes dinner and cleans the kitchen) but being more active making sure the kids are taken care of. Do more of the doctors visits. Take more time off from when the kids are sick and have to be out of daycare. Do more about making sure bills get paid. Putting my feelings aside so she feels supported. 

She gets the transfer and her “friendship” with coworker amplifies. They start sharing intimate details about personal lives, etc. I find out from her that he’s known around the office for trying to get with married women and that he himself has a rocky marriage. I wonder why. I tell her that she’s playing with fire and that they need to cool it. She blows up. Calls me controlling. I’m crazy for thinking they’re more than friends. I’m too jealous over nothing. “Any sane person would see this is innocent”. 

Cool.

We separate around November of last year. Not a legal separation mind you. Just for funsies I suppose. I was under the assumption we would re-assess our marriage and come back as stronger partners. APPARENTLY she took it to mean it was free game to cheat on me with coworker. And cheat on me she did. Won’t get into specifics, but know that I had to pull whatever truth I could out of her like it was the hardest thing I ever had to do. To this day I don’t think I got the whole truth and I never will. Oh well. 

Through counseling, I decide, for me if I wanted our marriage to work I had to put away my pain and forgive her. My marriage, my family, the years...it’s all more important than my hurt. So I forgive. I promise to look past it and hope from there on out we can move forward. Under the condition that she now has to be 100% honest with me and show me that if she wants it to work she has to prove it to me. And that regardless of the things either one of us had done prior to February, my temper, her cheating, it didn’t matter. This is our new start, and we can’t use the last 5ish years against the other. 

That was February. We got back together, and for the most part things were better. She told me she cut coworker off. Come to find out she didn’t and has since several times stayed in contact with him. (I wouldn’t know until later) Keep in mind. Throughout all of this, I hadn’t shown my temper or had an explosive moment in a long time. 

3 days ago. 
Things had been a little shaky but the month of June was rock solid. We’re clicking like we haven’t in a long time. We haven’t even argued about anything in over a month. I haven’t been upset/mad about anything. This is it, this is what I was hoping for and things are finally looking bright again. 

I see our phone bill and that there were more texts on her side than usual. I see because, come the fuck on of course I looked. It’s co worker again. Texting her on July 4 when were were down visiting my in-laws. I say nothing and just decide to go to bed early. Talk about it tomorrow. She notices I seemed a bit off. She asks what’s wrong. “...Nothing”.  Louder this time “what’s wrong?” I don’t want to talk about it. She doesn’t relent. I finally crack, “care to explain why I just saw that you and coworker texted again, and you didn’t think to let me know?  It would have been the perfect opportunity to show me that you’re trying to be open and honest and go toward rebuilding the trust that was lost. The trust you get mad at me for not having in you”. “It was nothing. Nothing happened I ignored him after the first text. Here you go all over again overreacting.” It turns into the same argument as always. We sleep in different rooms that night. 
The next day I reflect and tell her I’m sorry I got heated and misplaced my anger. I was mad at him for still trying to but into our lives. I wanted to tell her that she needs to tell him to fuck off and leave her alone because she’s working on it with her husband. She stops me short and tells me, the problem isn’t him, it’s my attitude. 

I’m floored. No more. I’m done. 

Today we go to speak to our divorce attorney.

My birthday was last week and we had everyone come over to hang out. A few hours in, my best friends’ (Joe) wife (Jane) comes in all dressed up, tells me happy birthday and then just disappears. The whole thing was a bit odd for those that noticed she was there. 

She FaceTimed me on her way back home and told me that she has loved me for the last 10 years that we’ve known each other and she couldn’t keep it in anymore. I’m in complete shock. She’s married and I’m married. 

She hangs up and I go straight to my wife (we’ll call her Liz) and tell her what just happened. Apparently Liz and the rest of my family have seen this coming for the past couple years and I was just oblivious to Jane’s behavior towards me. 

Yes, I told my family about it. If Jane ends up trying to mix me into some story, my family has my back. But my family all told me not to tell Joe and I know they all won’t say anything. It’s tearing me apart. Joe is my best friend and I’ve known him for as long as I’ve also known Jane. 

Jane and Joe have a kid and a business together. They’re obviously not happy but I don’t want to be the reason that they divorce. I also would hate to lose Joe because of this. It’ll mess up everything. Am I wrong for not telling Joe? Should I tell him? If so, how do I do it so that it doesn’t become my fault? I’m happily married to Liz, I want nothing to do with Jane.

t3_chpqy9,My fiance (f27) is leaving me (m27) and wants to do split custody of our 1 year old boy,"I am an absolute wreck right now and I don't know if sharing my story will help but here goes.

Biggest piece of context that should obviously come first is that we have a 1 year old son.

We started dating about 7 years ago and it was amazing at first. She's my best friend's cousin and I was working for their aunt's small business thanks to my best friend getting me the job. She was home from school for the summer and working there to save up some money (I say ""home"" because this is where we are both from. Her family was originally from the area she was going to school and recently moved back). We knew each other through the job before but didn't work together much but when we did, there was always a flirtatious chemistry. So when I found out she was going to be here all summer, I got excited and couldn't wait to get to know her better. The summer was unreal. We fell in love. Madly in love. After just a few months of dating we decided do stay together even though where she was going to school was about a 14 hour drive away. 

We did long distance for a year. It was incredibly hard but she decided to move back home and got a place right near me. We were now going to the same community college and I spent most of my time at her apartment. I wasn't in a great place at this time though. I was working a lot so school was hard and I had a few hiccups that delayed my transfer process. I wasn't happy with myself and felt as if I was running in place. When I finally got into university, I decided to break things off. It was a new chapter of my life and I wanted to do college as a single person. She moved back to go to school 14 hours away. I know I hurt but I think we both knew we still loved each other. The first 6 months we only talked occasionally but the contact started to pick up to the point where we talked every day. We were committed again and in a long distance relationship. This went on for a year and a half. Once again it was incredibly hard, but we got through it. When she graduated college, I still had a year left but we decided to move in together. We got a town home in my college town and it was great. Together forever at last. 

One big problem though. I like to smoke weed. She has never been a fan but became more accepting that I do it over time. She agreed it was okay that I did it in our home but it probably got out of hand. I did it every day. Mostly just at night. But when I'm smoking, I tend to stay up late and get pretty lazy. She's a neat freak and can't stand for the house to be a mess. My laziness made most of the house cleaning fall on her. 

The next big problem. We got a puppy. She wanted one so bad. I was hesitant but I love her so much I couldn't tell her no. And we were committed to each other, so committing to a dog together wasn't scary at first. With a dog comes a lot more work than either of us expected. And then me over here, senioritis, just want to stay up all night playing video games, most of that work fell on her. She went to work and came home for lunch and still had to take the dog out and whatever else because most of my classes were in the afternoon so I slept in, often till about 1PM. 

Graduation is coming up. Our lease is going to end. I didn't have a job lined up and hadn't changed my behaviors much. She decided to leave me and move back with her parents 14 hours away. This hurt like hell but I could sense that she wasn't completely sure. She stayed for my graduation and cheered harder than anybody when I walked across the stage. That day was bitter sweet though as the next day she was leaving. 

Within days, she realized she made a mistake. She wasn't happy being away from me. So we were back to talking everyday, saying ""I love you"", everything. I just had to get my shit together. I put my head down, quit smoking, and started searching for a job. 

She took the dog with her. We love him, but he's a handful. It was hard for her to do it alone. She had said when she decided to leave, that we shouldn't have gotten him because of the stress it put on us. I agreed but he's ours now and it is what it is. She called me one night in tears because she wanted to re-home him. I was adamant about her not doing this. I love my dog and couldn't live with myself after giving him up. She agreed to keep him. 

I finally found a contract job a few hours from home but still obviously very far from her. We decided to move in with each other again. I flew to her and her parents and I helped pack her up and move her across the country once again. We were happy again. In love. Together. 

This was a big city though. So it was hard for us to beat the traffic and come home to let the dog out during the day so we got a dog walker. Yet another expense on on top of many others that were hard to manage with our entry-level jobs. We made it work for the most part but we had some fights and things weren't perfect. Then it happened. She got pregnant. We were terrified. Not even close to ready. We stayed in the city for a while until my contact ended and moved back home with my mom and step dad. I aggressively searched for jobs until I finally found one. It was about an hour commute from my parents house. She really wanted to stay close to my family with the baby on the way since we were going to need some help. I agreed but was a bit reluctant due to the commute. So we found a house nearby my family and it was perfect for us. Her parents bought the house through the business they owned and rent it to us. The plan has anyways been for me to eventually buy it. Through all the feelings we were having about the changes in our lives, we leaned on each other. And I was strong for her. She had a tough pregnancy and I was always there to help her with whatever she needed. I manned up and was who she needed me to be finally. She had the baby and it was hard but we were making it work. And I was doing my part the best I could. Our son had some health scares early on and we leaned on each other through that. All of this brought us even closer. 

But over time, we settled into routines. She was staying home with baby and I worked. But I needed to come home and help her with things around the house and I fell short there. Some days I didn't but most, I did. I decided in my mind that it made no sense for me to wake up with him in the morning because I was the one working. This attitude trickled into many other responsibilities. 

We both put on a good bit of weight. It's hard to find time to workout and easy to eat out when there's not much time to cook. At least this is what I convinced myself.

Work got very stressful for me. Add the commute to it and I was miserable. I started staying up late because I was anxious about work and didn't want to go. So I tried to enjoy more me time than I probably should. Then I started smoking again and it made all of that worse. I would go to work exhausted and have no energy when I got home. And I was hiding the smoking from her. I would wait till she went to sleep. She caught me and we had a big fight. She didn't want me doing it. I thought ""I'm a grown man, I should be able to do this as long as I'm still the father I need to be"" and I truly believed that. So I tried to convince her to let me keep doing it. Because it relaxed me and helped with my anxiety. But I was ignorant to the fact that it made me stay up even later and that has a domino effect on many other things. I told her I'd quit. I didn't. She caught me again. Told her I'd stop. I didn't. Finally she caught me again and told me to leave. I begged her to let me stay and she agreed but she was hurt. Instead of realizing just how hurt she was, I decided to continue to convince her that it wasn't that big of a deal. Not necessarily so I could keep doing it, but so that I wasn't viewed as this terrible person in her eyes. But it doesn't matter how bad she views the smoking itself, I lied to her repeatedly. I felt bad about it then but now my eyes are wide open and I hate myself for it. 

I know I have anxiety and may suffer from depression. I don't like to say it because it feels like excuses. But the truth is, I let the stresses of these major life shifts get the better of me. And let the ones I love around me suffer through it with me. 

A few more months passed and his first birthday passed and I thought things were okay. But she shut me out a lot and really turned down the affection. Whether it be just spending time or being physical. Our sex life was almost non-existent at this point and when we did have sex, it seemed to be more to appease me than anything. Last week I got in bed with her and put my arm around to cuddle her. She let out an annoyed exhale and made no effort to welcome me in to cuddling her. So I rolled over and she asked me what was wrong. I essentially asked her if she still wanted to be with me. To which she responded, no and that she doesn't feel the same way about me anymore. We talked a bit more and I promised her I'd change. I'd do more around the house and step up more for our son. She has gone pretty cold at this point and didn't have much to say other than she needed space. I took our son and the dog to my moms and left her to herself all weekend. We only talked about our son, this is what she wanted. I came back home on Sunday and we talked. I promised her I was going to be a new person. This time, I actually believe myself. But I can't tell if she does. I had already gone to the gym every day over the weekend and started a diet that I am determined to stick to. She told me she wants me to work on myself but to do it away from her. She said she missed our son over the weekend, but not necessarily me and the dog. I still convinced her to let me stay. She said I could stay for the week. I got up every morning this week with our boy, kept him entertained, changed him, fed him, while she got ready for work. Then she takes him to daycare because it's near her work and not mine. I then get ready for work and then come home and have made dinner twice this week when I've gotten home in time, did everything I could think to do to help her around the house, absolutely busting my ass. 

She says this has actually pissed her off more than anything because I am proving that I'm capable of doing these things but have refused to do then for most of the past year. I understand this. I'm pissed at myself too. I wish I could go back in time and not be such a shit bag. Another thing I did was continue to tell her ""I love you"" during the times I normally would. She wasn't saying it back. This triggered her wanting to talk to me last night. She said she needed me to stop saying it. She feels like it's hurting me every time she doesn't and it makes her feel awkward. I just feel awkward not saying it because it's how I feel. She then tells me she wants me to leave. I continue to fight to convince her to believe that I'm changed but it's ""too little too late"" and then anger sets in and I say some things I wish I could shove right back in my mouth. I'm so angry with her but at the same time I can't blame her. 

She wants to do split custody. I will never agree to anything less than 50% of the time with my son but it's killing me to think we will have a different roof over our heads for the other 50%. I also have nowhere to go but my moms where it's cramped and not where I want to be raising my son. My mom is willing to help me out and I'm appreciative, but I just want to be home where our family can be together and he has all of his things that he needs.

I love this girl and I want my family all in one piece. I can't believe I've been so ignorant for so long. I've told her and I mean it, I will do anything to fix this.

If anybody else has gone through something similar, how did you handle it?

TLDR: Fiance leaving me after 7 years. We have a 1 year old son. My laziness/marijuana use/personal issues have wore on her and she says she doesn't love me anymore.",relationship_advice
t3_chppz2,I’m confident in our relationship but jealous about attention,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 4 years and he is absolutely wonderful. He teaches me new things every day and opens me up to so many perspectives and I love him dearly. I know that he won’t cheat on me, or at least I truly believe that he won’t. That’s not my concern. He has done an amazing job reassuring me and making me feel secure, which is why I don’t get why I act so irrational. 

Lately he’s been showing a prolonged interest in a girl that he took a summer course with and I went a little crazy. I get flustered and paranoid whenever I hear about her, I’m not sure what I’m paranoid of though. I understand that it is okay for him to be non romantically interested in other girls, the logic is completely sound with what he is doing but it still makes me feel horrible and I don’t know why. 

I used to be a little up tight and am trying really hard to let that go because I don’t want him to feel like this relationship is holding him back from anything, he should be able to do just about anything he wants. I just need help to get my emotional side under control and on the same page as my logical side.",relationship_advice

t3_chnxcs,I don't know what to do.,"Ok so, I've never once made a post on Reddit before, so I just made this random account. I've lurked around though. Anyways I am feeling hurt by something my bf did, and he doesn't know I found out about it. We are a gay couple, been together for over 2 years. We both have new cars, thanks to my credit being very good, and live in a decent home in Florida. He has changed jobs about 6 times since I've met him. And 4 times since we have been living together. I've managed to keep the same job for over 5 years. 

Well it turns out that someone I work with knew the project manager he worked for at his old job. In fact they are very good friends and the only reason they know about us is we had gone to my friends wedding and bumped into his old project manager. I have to bring this up so you can understand why I'm so hurt by what happens next. 

Yesterday morning I went into work and my friend pulls me aside and tells me she has something she thinks I need to know about. Well project manager for bf told my friend that bf was fired from his job for always being late and always being on his phone rather than working. He had told me he was laid off. Now this is the one that is really hitting me hard. Bf told people he worked with that I was depressed because we had adopted a child and shortly after the state was involved and took the kid away and I was contemplating suicide. I don't know how to react to hearing about this information, as this isn't the first time I've caught him in a lie, but never this bad of one. I want to sit him down and talk about it because I need to know why someone would just come up with a story like that. But at the same time I really just want to pack my car and leave without saying a word.",relationship_advice
t3_chnwtu,Long Distance Advice ?,"Me [17F] and my boyfriend [19M] has been dating for nearly 2 years now. He’s going off to university thousands of miles away. 

I don’t want to tie him down or be a burden to his new life, but since we decided to try out long distance is there any tips or things I should be aware of ?? We are pretty chill and open, like we communicate well. We both decide to just go with the flow and see if it works out. 

We both are aware that with distance and time it will be harder to be together, and there will be new people we would wanna explore and meet. We are comfortable with that thought; like I don’t mind if he wants to break up and meet someone else, don’t wanna tie him down and guilt him he’s 19 lmao vise versa. 

There’s more issues than what I’ve stated above and those issues are also more nuanced. I just want to know more of what to expect and what’s gonna happen so I can prepare ?? Also maybe tips to make the relationship more fun and not that much of a burden.",relationship_advice

t3_chnwky,My husband (35) is making me (26)choose between my dog and him. What should I do?,"My husband and I have been together for 7 years. A year and a half ago we rescued a dog that we knew had been abused. When I went to the shelter to look for a dog, he wasn’t really a part of the process. I showed him several dogs and he had an uninterested attitude. I ended up getting a chiweenie because I love wiener dogs and he loves chihuahuas. I told him they were a difficult breed but he dismissed it.

They haven’t exactly bonded. My dog has picked me as his owner and he’d do anything to protect me.

Last night we were trying to give him medicine and he snapped. He is scared when people touch his eyes for some reason. So, he growled. My husband decided to smack him across the face with the remote. Then my dog bit him on the arm. 

I got bit in the process as well. Now my husband is being terrible to my dog and I don’t really think it was his fault. He shouldn’t have hit the dog in the face. 

He said I always pick the dog over him and that I needed to choose. He hasn’t changed his mind this morning. I love my dog. I can’t get rid of him but I also want to work this out with my husband.

**Also, this is not the first time something like this has happened. My husband thought it would be funny to get right into my dogs face and growl at him and make mean faces. My dog growled and tried to get him to go away but he continued, so the dog bit him.

Then another time he was annoying the cat and the cat scratched his lip and he was so pissed at him for weeks.

I don’t want to choose sides but I don’t think this is my dogs fault. Am I wrong here or is he making terrible decisions?!",relationship_advice
t3_chmuwa,"Can take the girl out the club, but cant make a stripper a housewife","I'm having some serious doubts about my relationship with my boyfriend, and it's so frustrating.

I used to be a stripper, and that's how he met me. We hung out a few times outaide of my work and then we finally did the deed after a few weeks of dating. We had a DTR talk and we became boyfriend and girlfriend, so I know I wasnt confused in the early days. We used to see each other 1-3 times a week. I took Saturdays off because Sundays were his only day off, and he would come over for dinner once or twice during the week. 

We were both recently divorced, and we were both on the same page of that not happening again. He told me he wasn't opposed to getting a place together eventually in the future, but he wasnt really into the thought of marriage. I was almost the same. I was open to getting a place together, but would consider marriage again only without it being my final destination. I'd be happy without it.

So we were just in what I thought to be a committed relationship and then I became pregnant. I'm 100% pro choice, but I knew how he felt about kids and how much hed wanted one, so I decided we should make the decision together. I told him and we went from there. Wed been dating 6 months and had literally just said I love yous for the first time like a month before. 

We went through the pregnancy together. I quit stripping when I was 4 months along and got a civilian job. We were getting our ducks in a row, and we finally moved in together the month before my due date. 

That first month was fun, but I noticed he liked to drink. A lot. Like a 6 pack to himself everytime he drank. I told him to chill i know hes excited to have his own place again, and that the baby was coming, but i wanted him to be able to remember the birth of his child-- and be able to drive us to the hospital if need be. Long story short, I ended up being induced, had a normal hospital stay and th en was home. 

We originally planned for him to be home for a month, but he ended up being home for only 2 weeksishs. Luckily it was december, so most of the weeks were 3 day weeks and he was home the rest of the time. After he went back to work our relationship went slowly down hill. After I was let go from my job before returning from maternity leave it fell off a damn cliff. 

He drinks  A LOT. He'll bring home a 6 pack on Tuesdays, one on Wednesday, buy a 12 pack Thursday, finish the 12 pack from Thursday on Friday, buy another 12 pack Friday night and finish it, buy another 12 pack Saturday and finish it, drink beer all day Sunday, bring some home with him after bbqing all day, and then on Monday finish whatever is in the fridge. That's an average week. Sometimes it's more sometimes it's less. Sometimes he goes out drinking with his friends and comes home so wasted he passes out on the toilet. Those next days are so much fun. 

He just seems so unhappy to me, and I feel like it's because of me. I feel like hes drinking because he doesnt want to admit he doesnt like me anymore, and I've tried to talk to him about it, but he never says anything. But when hes drunk, his feelings come out.

Some things hes told me while drunk:
1 I dont show appreciation for all that he does for us.
2 he doesnt want me to go back to stripping because he would feel dirty laying in bed next to me after work.
3 actions speak louder than words, I'm a mooch and that's why I am having a hard time finding a new job after being let go.
4 he cant trust me because I spent all my tax return and baby shower money that was gifted to us. (I paid off our debts and have $1500 in savings)
5 I dont clean enough
6 I talk shit about his mom (I dont. I just complain about all the food she makes because we end up taking the leftovers home and it's so much we have to throw it away.)

What got me the most was the dirty comment. That to me just.... the best way to put it is how I understood it. 

I am the same exact person I was before. I still have the same morals and respect, so how would it be dirty now and not then? I'm not a different person, so why was I good enough to fuck around with, and now I'm magically good enough to make a life with? 

I guess to simplify it, now that you have background, am I wrong for not wanting to raise my daughter in the same house as him? 

I dont want to raise her to be ashamed of me or my past, because shell find out eventually, and I dont want to raise her in a house with a drunk. So would it be better to split and co parent?

 And in regards to the co parenting, his drinking scares me. He does mean shit when hes drunk sometimes. Hes screamed at our 6 month old baby to stop crying. And I mean SCREAMed. It scared me. I didnt know who he was for a second. And he just so nonchalantly tries to drive when we're leaving his parents house it worries me that hell drive drunk with her in the car. 

I really dont know what to do. I'm just so tired and I'm not sure if all the effort to leave would really make a difference. 

I love him, he gave me the greatest gift ever, but he is making my life so hard.",relationship_advice

t3_chpkhc,My wife is a creature of habit until she forgets what he habit is and starts a new one.,"It's an odd situation varying from the humourous to observe, annoying to be alongside and excessively aggravating to be blamed for. 

I have gone with an anonymous profile incase she recognizes the situations, but that is unlikely as I think this all stems from her being self-unaware.

The humourous examples are losing her keys constantly because she can never remember what ""her spot"". It takes her 15 min to leave the house sometimes (without the kids) because she keeps forgetting things.

The annoying is when she uses my toothbrush because she legitimately thinks it is hers. I suspect she uses my towel as well but that's a difficult thing to confirm. Sometimes it is wet/damp when I haven't had a shower yet that day.

The aggravating is being blamed for things that she has forgotten about doing or not doing, or whichever she thinks was my job which changed from when we divided the jobs. I realize that is a little vague but it is difficult to be more specific.

Having written all of the above I don't blame her for anything. She just seems unaware of how what she does affects people around her. Has anyone else had to deal with an unaware spouse? How do you manage? Nothing in this situation is a deal breaker, I'm just looking for how to deal with this.",relationship_advice

t3_chmt1l,Idk if this is a toxic relationship or if im just paranoid..,"So this is my first actual serious relationship. Im 19f, hes 24m. We met on tinder. Clicked instantly. He was living in a hotel (with his career, living in one is logical), me in my own apartment. Within 2 weeks he was suggesting moving in. I thought it was too soon but caved in about a month later. My family moved away and i would be struggling to buy food, do laundry, etc w/o transportation. Him moving in helped Alot. And things were going well so far. We had some issues here and there with me being close to my coworkers and the fact many of them were ex-felons and males so he refused to trust them (i worked at a food joint). 
We decided to move out of state so i could be near my family. He got a job out there. He said it was fine i wouldnt be working for awhile, i was gonna start college, needed to see the toll on me. I left state to see my other side of family for a month. Timing was bad cuz we didnt have a place yet. But the entire time i was there, he claimed i was acting different, wasnt being clingy anymore, wasnt calling enough (i texted Constantly to the point i felt rude to fam, i didnt feel like i was acting different). Even got pissed i visited my brother at his place cuz apparently me saying i was Only visiting my dad out there meant i could Only visit my dad and my brother shouldve came to my dads to see me instead of me to him. I missed my flight (bad planning), he flipped out and said he would leave me if i didnt get home (he said later that this was meant to get me to try harder). He helped buy a ticket for a week later. While i was there, he also kinda guilt tripped me over the fact he wasnt getting sex because i was gone (he still actually occasionally mentions this). tho it concerns me cuz he has said that is the Last time ill be allowed to go visit my family out of state without him, meaning if i ever wanna leave town like i do Every Single Year to visit them, i have to hope he'll have the money and time off work to go with me :/. 
I got home. Things were good for awhile. Hes so hot and cold tho. One day hes super sweet and the next, i feel like im on eggshells. I could make a noise at the wrong time, forget a small piece of info, and hes mad. Some examples: i was helping him fix his car depsite not knowing anything about it. He got snappy cuz hes told me that info 5 times so i apparently cant help. Even got snappy cuz i accidentally made a noise.---our dogs lease got caught on a candle pillar and scrapped it around in panic. In panic, he started peeing all over and escaped his leash also. My bf spanked his butt (lightly), but we both know this makes our dog panic and any situation worse. I asked him to not be so rough on him. He got pissed and said ""your really gonna get on me rn about being rough?""(i never touch our dog unless hes physically hurting me by being excited and jumping me, which i simply push him off me and say ""stop."") And i said he was being rude and he told me to ""get the fuck out of his face"". 
Ive been feeling like a burden lately cuz im not working. I have a job, they just havent started me. But im the sole cleaner of the house and cooker. I make sure dinners on the table, work lunch packed, house cleaned, animals fed, etc. But hes on me usually about something random not done. Like if im sleeping and the dog ate all his food, even if i filled it before bed. If he comes home and its empty, he'll throw snide comments at me about it, even if i explained i filled it before bed and just woke up. I addressed the burden issue and it got off topic after he said i wasnt a burden and such. I brought it back to topic since i didnt feel it had been Fully addressed and he suddenly got pissed i hadnt started the food i said i would start and said ""well i guess ill make the food since its taking so long and i gotta sleep before work soon"". And wouldnt let me step in to help cook it. 
He also does other things i dont like. Like if a girls walking in a store parking lot with super revealing clothes, he'll tell me they are sluts and such. Or if theres homeless, its ""why dont they get a job?"". I personally see 0 reason to judge people so this bothers me.
 Hes been cheated on by his ex wife mutiple times so he has alot of trust issues and hes gotten better at that Alot since we first started dating. But..
Usually hes super sweet to me. Hes the type whos let me go outside and cry on his shoulder cuz im depressed, making sure i have my meds for my depression, taking me to appointments, etc. When i thought i was pregnant, he was super supportive and said whatever i decide to do, he'll support me. Supporting me pursing a degree and supporting me despite me changing my mind 500 times on my major choice. Etc. Hes a very supportive person. Always wanting to move forward with me like randomly asking if i still wanna marry him or if i will or if ill have kids with him (he knows i dont want any of this for atleast another year but he knows i find it sweet to be told). Its just these cold streaks he has.. Idk if its the stress of being the sole provider right now, bills, were living in a crappy apartment where the landlord wont fix any issues, my job screwing me over right now, knowing no one here, my college screwing me over to, etc. 
I just cant tell if these are normal arugements in a relationship or abusive or what..",relationship_advice
t3_chmsvi,Why am I so upset about losing a girl who only ever wanted to use me?,"I don’t know why I’m so upset. Yes she was beautiful. Yes she was confident. Yes she was brilliant socially. But she was horrible to me. Now I look back on it I can clearly see that she was only ever feeding me breadcrumbs to keep me sticking around having sex with her, going on dates, talking about her issues, when she never had any intention of taking it any further with me. She’d always say just enough to make it acceptable for her to just bounce on me whenever she wanted but the manipulation and confusion really got to me. She’ll never take responsibility for what happened and it’s always my fault. 

So why am I so upset about losing her? She kept trying to keep little tabs on me by re-adding me on social media and she seemed to always know what was going on with my life. Even after she has ghosted me for 3 months. She had been keeping tabs the whole time. Until I deleted her off social media and she re-added me. She tried to friend zone me and I had to suck up everything and tell her no. She didn’t take that well at all. 

After all this I’m still really down on myself and blame myself for everything. Can’t stop thinking about if I’d done this differently or that differently or just played it a little more cool, it wouldn’t be this way. It’s really triggered my anxiety and depression and I’m not in a great place mentally tbh. Some days I feel like I should at least take it as a compliment that this stunning girl really wanted to sleep with me, but then some days I just feel like a total loser for her not wanting more with me and I must be really boring or unwantable or something.

t3_chphwl,I (F/23) have trust issues with my husband (M/25) all due to his best friends.,"When we first got to know each other I genuinely thought he was a pretty good person but what really made me like him was how honest he seemed even when he knew it may not be in his favor. My husband has a clique of friends that he absolutely adores and he see them as his genuine brothers. I do not have any issues with that at all. But I recently discovered most of them are straight up cheaters. Literally one of them travelled with my husband and I and I read a convo between them during that time. One night his friend invited him to go out and hang out. I personally felt a bad vibe from his friend and felt uneasy about the guy so I insisted on going with him to which he said no he just wanted to hang out as guys. So whatever. In the messages though, the guy was planning to take my husband clubbing and even found some “girls” to take with them. 
the convo went like this

friend: “hey whose by u right now”
husband: “my wife obviously “
friend: calls husband for a couple of minutes 
call ends
friend:”listen theres women”
husband: “I don’t have money”
husband: “from where are the women???”
friend: “don’t worry about it”
husband:”forget it let’s just hang out just us guys”


When I asked my husband where him and the guy went he told me at his friends relatives house. 
Which turned out to be a damn lie, they went to some club and played poker. 
This is just one example. He has many friends who are married and talk about how they can’t wait to go on their trip and be with other women, My husband honestly has never said anything
he also usually doesn’t talk in the group chat when they send porno videos. 

I hate feeling uneasy because of his asshole friends but there’s a saying that your friends are a reflection of you .. Idc what he did in the past and I highly doubt he has cheated on me but I am always a bit uneasy because of how disgusting his “really close friends are”
How should I go about this and am I justified for feeling uncertain about his character ?",relationship_advice
t3_chph4x,Having a hard time trying to make the relationship more serious,"I (M25) have been talking to (F22) for a couple of weeks now. She is such a wonderful person and we get along amazingly. The problem I’m having is that we have a very similar sense of humour so we are constantly making weird jokes together and being sarcastic. We never have serious conversations because when they’re brought up, they are quickly brushed aside by whomever the topic is focused on because I’m assuming neither of us want to chance ruining our jokey type mood(were very similar). 

Now over text if I compliment her she never straight up accepts it so it makes me think she doesn’t really like being affectionate. I know she likes me though because she’s more open over text about her feelings. Saying things like she can’t wait to see me and saying she wants to cuddle at night time. The problem is when we meet in person. So we’ve gone out twice now and both times were a lot of fun but that’s because we just joke around and shoot the shit the whole time. Not once did we ever flirt back and forth. I tried to but it seemed like I was making the mood awkward by doing that so eventually I just stopped trying. After the first date I thought maybe it’ll be different on the second one. Over text it definitely was, she seemed a lot more into me and flirtatious. But the second date was even better in the sense of us getting along and laughing at how dumb we are but even less of a romantic feel to it. It’s been two days since the second date and talking to her over text she’s seeming very distant compared to how we would message before. (Also nothing physical happened after either date, she had work the next morning both times so she just said she was tired and needed to go home and then left promptly)

Now obviously I’ve got a lot of things running through my mind wondering what I should have done differently. Should I have just been less of a pussy and not worry about ruining the mood by being more bold during the conversations and given her a goodnight kiss before she left? 

I know she has a close guy friend that she has a similar jokey relationship with but he’s married. I’m worried I’ll fall into that category aswell despite wanting a more serious relationship with her.
Now what I’m really wondering is, should I confront her over text about what I’m feeling and try to clear the air? Would that make things worse for me? What’s your guys take on all of this? The way things are right now makes a third date seem like it’s out of the question.",relationship_advice
t3_chpf9u,Girlfriend thinks I'm being paranoid,"This was posted in AITA originally, reposted here because it was deleted

I really need help with this one as I'm honestly not sure where I stand. 

A little bit of background info:
Its my first ever relationship and I am now 22 years old, first ever girl I've kissed and all that. I'm quite insecure about myself (after I met her I ended up dropping out of my Navy enrolment to see where things lead and gained 25kg quite quickly), so I've not got much confidence to begin with in my body and how much I actually mean to people / whag my value is. 

This happened around 1 year ago, my girlfriend and I had been together around 7 months at this point.
She is studying in the UK from a different country and ended up going home for the holidays. Whilst she was home she booked a holiday with her best friend who is a guy, and it was just them two going on it. I was at first a little bit worried, but I thought ""It's cool, but I'd appreciate it if they slept in different rooms"" as she would have the exact same thoughts if it was me with a friend who is a girl. She ended up responding with ""okay I will try, but I'm not sure on accommodation"" as her friend was booking it.

A week or so later it turns out that he booked one room, so my next though was ""I guess that alright, but don't sleep in the same bed"" (and I'm sure any guy would think this...right?) so when the time comes around for their holiday I was excited for her, because she doesn't have many friends and I love it when she spends time with them, because it makes her so happy.

A night or so later I video call her (the connection is really bad where she went) and she shows me around the room. It turns out that the beds in the rooms weren't individual, but it looked like the hotel staff had pushed 2 beds together to make one, so I thought that's weird but they can just separate it to sleep differently. But they didn't do that. Instead they slept essentially in the same bed (I guess?) so at this point my mind was going all over the place. I was getting paranoid left, right and centre and when she video called me the following night she was under the covers with just her face showing (the covers were covering her chin partially) so this was a bigger red flag to me also. Me, being in this insecure and paranoid state asked to see under the covers... But aparantly that's where I went wrong.

To her, I broke all trust then by believing that something had happened between her and her friend. She occasionally brings it up in arguments as a point, and I think my suspicions were justified. 

I'm really struggling here so it would be real big help if you guys would give me some advice

AITA for thinking this?

Tldr; girlfriend went on holiday with guy friend, slept in the same bed and I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid about asking to see under the covers when she was under them

Edit: I'm not sure if the beds were separate and pushed together, but I've stayed in ones before that are double beds but with separate mattresses, so it looks like they were",relationship_advice
t3_chpf97,My (28m) GF (23f) Isn't Over Her Ex,"I feel like I met this girl at the wrong time. We have a ton in common, we work on the same field, we share a sense of humor - I felt like I'd known her my whole life a week after we met.  
 
We were friends for 3 years prior to dating. For most of that time she had a boyfriend who she eventually left for me - that wasn't planned, I was offered a job in another state on 2 weeks notice, things got said. The breakup was on good terms, turns out he was already planning to end things anyway - they loved each other but they didn't want the same things out of life.  
  
We went all in immediately. She kept her place but moved into mine, we met each other's families within a month, we got a dog, etc. It's been truly wonderful, mostly. 
 
She's, very understandably, not over her ex of 2.5 years that she broke up with the day before she moved in with me. That's caused some issues on both sides - the first time we had sex she orgasmed from PIV and she got mad at herself because she hadn't with her ex and ""it felt disrespectful to that relationship"", she wanted to keep a remarkable amount of memorabilia from him that I didn't love, she'd break down crying over a song or similar that they'd liked.  
 
We knew there'd be issues, we've worked through them. At first there was good ""progress"", she hasn't cried in months, she doesn't mention him anymore, etc. But it seems things have kind of plateaud. 10 months later she says she doesn't love him anymore and she doesn't want that relationship back, she doesn't even talk to him anymore, but that it still hurts that it's gone, she still gets sad sometimes. It's been that way for a while now, just kind of stuck at her being 95% here but I still feel like the other 5% is back in her previous relationship.

t3_chpdlj,Have I been exploited? or am I complicating things?,"Our friends set us up together, we met for few times, and I ended up asking her frankly if she is thinking about a relationship, she said she is not sure, she doesn't know me that well, and we should spend more time getting to know each other. She suggested meeting sometime before I travel back home (for winter break), few hours before meeting up she sent a message saying she will be too shy to meet me alone, but she said she wants to send something back home with me, so we met for few minutes, I pickup up the stuff and delivered the package, when I was back home we texted for a little bit, she asked me to bring stuff back for her. I met her mom and dad to pickup the stuff, and I met her when I got back to give her the stuff. After that she started acting weird, she ignored my phone call, but always called me back few days later, I met her with friends a couple of times after that. The last piece of interaction was as follows, she went in a trip back home, I called her when she got back, but she didn't answer, two weeks later she gave me a call, apologizing for being so busy. I told her I want to meetup, she said sure, let me check my schedule and I'll let you know. She never did, and now it's four month later and I'm so confused, why did she call me back? why did she make me meet her mom / dad? why did she disappear without saying anything?

t3_chpdch,"My (25M) dad (60M) is struggling with work and health issues. We've always had a good relationship, and I want to help/talk through these issues with him.","tl;dr: Dad is having some health/maybe alcohol related issues, not sure how to share my concerns on these issues in the most helpful way.

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says, I’ve always had a good relationship with my dad. He’s taught me many life lessons, we share some interests and hobbies, and routinely have a good time hanging out. However, he’s facing some issues that concern me, my mom and my sister-described below in detail.

&amp;#x200B;

For quick background, he was recently let go from a long-term job. I don’t know full details, but I do know it wasn’t due to anything major (blowout argument, harassment, etc.). From what I know, it sounds like performance issues due to complacency. He’s looking for a new job to work a few more years before retirement, but I’m not too worried about that-not much I could do to help with a job anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to the stuff that concerns me-where I feel like I can and need to help.

&amp;#x200B;

He has 2 bad knees and is overweight. This has been an issue for some years, but I’ve more recently noticed that his mobility is not good-struggling with stairs, etc. He does low-impact exercise pretty frequently (so he’s in decent cardiovascular shape), but the poor mobility is a little unnerving to me. He enjoys being somewhat active (travel, gardening, etc.), and I worry about his ability to do this in retirement without some improvements.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is the issue of alcohol. I would say he drinks 6 days out of the week, and a rough guess would be 5-6 drinks or more an evening. This includes a fair amount of liquor later at night (sipping tequila, not taking shots-as if it makes a difference anyway). He also seemingly hides the amount of liquor he consumes (conceals his full-ish glass, has a hidden stash of bottles, etc.), so on some level he must know this is wrong. I’m not sure if he’s spoken with his doctor about this alcohol use and the impact it likely has on his weight. While employed, he would also regularly sleep in late (hours were kinda flexible)-but I’m worried that if a new job has different morning expectations, this will be a challenge for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to address these with my dad, since I feel that they’re all interrelated-improving health and alcohol use would help him at work and in retirement. He’s worked hard during his career to save for a decent retirement, and I really want to see him enjoy the fruits of his labor with my mom. We all love dad, and we want him to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m at a loss here. I feel comfortable discussing this stuff with my dad (and I think he'll take it okay at least), but I’m not sure how to frame it. I want what I say to be impactful without it being a lecture. Anyone gone through anything similar or have advice on how to frame such a discussion?",relationship_advice
t3_chktgn,Having a rough patch with my girlfriend.,"We come from the same small town and recently moved to Stockholm together. Before that we travelled 5 months abroad. 

Somewhere on this trip we started being petty and fight somewhat more. As I said we moved in together and everything seemed fine for a bit. We don't really do the sex since she's never been fully comfortable with it, leaving me sometimes frustrated. 

We're both quite hot delivered and the smallest things tend to blow up. She has a bossy very structural personality while I'm more of a take the day as it comes kind of guy. 

Anyway, recently we discussed doing a semester abroad and she pruposed having an open relationship to help get over the sex choking point. 
I'm not sure how to feel about this and why she feels so much pressure with me in particular.


She means the world to me and we still have good fun together, however just this morning we argued about something minor and I was tired and didn't really pay attention, I also have trouble listening to someone that starts the conversation with such an aggressive tone (even though she doesn't mean it, It's just the way she was raised, quite bossy family being right all the time). I called her mommy (yeah I know) and started to do the things she wanted done. She then said someting like I didn't care about her (trust me, I'm the showing emotions person in this relationship) and so I got mad with her. Ended in her walking straight up to me and smacking me saying I bully her psycologically and I punched a freakin' hole in the bathroom door, not my proudest moment, hurt myself while doing it too.

I'm not an idiot and I know this wont last in It's current state. I'm tired of bustin my ass and then come home to a fight over dishes. 

We are both under profoundly pressure from school, work and sex problems and just can't seem to see eye to eye. Anyone else had this kind of relationship problems or any tips how to handle theese tense situations..?",relationship_advice
t3_chp9gd,"Emotionally abusive boyfriend, or just lack of trust?","So I've been dating with my (now I guess ex) for half a year, the relationship went mostly online, long hours of video calls, and then we met for 2 weeks. I can't describe with words how beautiful it was, he was super caring and sometimes when we had fights he started to cry, we cried together and always worked everything out. He was everything I wanted from my future husband. I know that he has very strong feelings for me, (and so do I.) 

And that's the problem. He is extremely jealous, I cannot even innocent text my male friends, he asks about every single guy I ever mentioned, he stalks my messages and when I even slightly mention something that goes against our relationship (even though it's a joke and he knows it), he gets extremely mad, to the extent when he emotionally abuses me. (He tells me he's gonna leave me just so I can ""enjoy"" my time with my male friends. And if I want him, I should be 24/7 available for him - he didnt say this but you get the idea) He wants me to suffer because of him, because presumably I make him suffer too (because I text my male friends and sometimes ""ignore"" his messages - I'm busy and can't text him straight away). However it never got as bad as today, he calls me names, including swearwords, which really does hurt me since I've never thought he would do something like this. What is more he created a bunch of fake profiles of me and is contacting my friends as well as random guys offering my nudes including my phone number, he has sent me some of those pictures and said he's gonna spread it all over. I know this behaviour is absolutely inacceptable, psycho and dumb. (He would say: but you enjoy talking to guys, so there you go, I make it easier for you.) But at the same time I know how strong his feelings to me are, and I think he is doing that because he is hurt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I do love him, and I know he loves me too, way too much, I think he is doing this as a ""revenge"" for me not behaving the way he is expecting me to, and he also doubts my feelings for him all the time, even though I have proved him many times that I only love him.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is absolutely not okay, but I'm just wondering if there's a way to fix him? If I should still try to talk it all through with him? I know this relationship is toxic, but I'm just worried I'll never find anyone else who can love me the way he did, or still does. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or is there a possibility that it's my fault because I constantly keep talking to/calling my male friends and if I wanna be with him I should give it up? I've never cheated on him and I always keep him updated about what I talk about with them (he wont act normal until I do.) - I'd also like to mention that the men I talk to are mostly online too, and I don't spend with them more than a couple minutes per day, but yeah, sometimes it interrupts the time I ""should"" be calling him.

&amp;#x200B;

All help is really appreciated!

t3_ch5qpm,My (17F) boyfriend (19M) acted super weird after sex.,"He’s always seemed like a sweet guy, and I had a crush on him for a long time. We have been dating for 3 months, and last night we had sex together for the first time. I have only slept with one other person before him. However he has slept around a tad bit. We’re talking 7 partners. He said a couple things during that were odd to me but I just let him do his thing. The one that stuck in particular was “I’d let you shit in my f’ing mouth”. He finished in seconds, and I asked if he would finish me with his fingers and he said “what’s the matter cheddar biscuits, didn’t get your fill?” And then straight up open palm smacked my titty. It hurt, and he just kind of stood there. I was shocked and I asked why in the world he would do that. He didn’t have an answer, he just said he didn’t know. 

I am horribly turned off by this, would I be a bad person if I break things off? Even if everything else is perfect?

EDIT: What in the world is a cheddar biscuit? I’m googling it to see if it’s slang for anything but all I’m finding is literal biscuits made with cheddar cheese and stuff about the Green Bay Packers.

However, when I got home and was ironing my gown, my Mother started scolding me for switching on all the lights in the house - I reasoned it was as I can’t see if I was ironing or burning my gown. She scolded me for doing it so last minute and I told her it was cause I was rather busy the whole week. She then said, “But you’re so free to busybody and care about other people but your family and your own things you don’t care.” She said it in a very mean and harsh tone. 

And to be honest, before I got home I was already in a rather upset/depressive state because of some previous issues. When I burnt my pinky on the iron, I started crying because I’ve had so much built in over the past shitty week I had and I kept telling myself not to cry cause I don’t want to look like a swollen puffball tomorrow. 

But I couldn’t help it and cried anyway. When I cried and cried, my Mother noticed and just screamed at me, “Don’t come act all pitiful in front of me”. She then threw a cream at me and it hit me. 

At the point in time, I really felt so depressive I really want to die. Heck, I really do want to die right now. What’s the point when I feel so unloved? Its like nobody really cares about me. So what if I live? Everybody puts so much pressure on me but do they even truly love me. It’s my special day tomorrow but no one really cares.

t3_chp785,Me and my girlfriend just got into a fight over our Halloween plans.,"Earlier tonight, my girlfriend of a year and a half came to me and told me that we're going to a costume party for Halloween. The people hosting the party held a party last year and we went to that as well, the theme being celebrities. That wasn't so bad since a lot of people have told me that I look like Matt Damon and I just trimmed my hair a little shorter and put on some generic clothing. Still, the hosts of the party are friends with my girlfriend and I honestly don't like them. They remind me of Bob and Midge from That 70's Show and I can't stand them. This year they're hosting another party and the theme is comic book movies. I personally don't like comic book movies and I'm honestly baffled by this generation's sudden fascination with being nerdy and making geekiness a mainstream thing.

My girlfriend told me that we're going and that she's going to buy me a costume. She said that she wants us to be a comic book couple, but I've told her that I don't want to go. I told her that I don't like her friends and that I also don't like dressing up for Halloween. She says that it's ""tradition"" for us to go even though we've only gone to one of their parties and I responded by telling her that she can survive going without me, which pissed her off.

She told me that I'm going no matter what and I really want to get out of this. Halloween just isn't for me and I don't want to be surrounded by a bunch of stupid comic book nerds.

t3_chp2eg,Me (18M) has a crush on a co-worker (18F) but I dont know if she likes me.,"
So I work at a nursing home and my work days are on Tuesdays and Saturdays everyweek. In dutch it is called Zorg After School (ZAS) which is a job especially for younger people who has free time after school. It is a 3 hour job but it pays very good. 
I'm enjoying it so far.  I'm not a nurse of some kind, I am just cleaning tables, serve food and talk with the eldery who live there. Its from 4.30pm to 7.30pm always. 

But now its summer vacation and the management hired some vacation workers. They usually work in the early mornings but sometimes they work in the evening aswell. I knew that there were 2 new female workers because it was written on papers and such.
The vacation workers always wear a blue shirt so I can recognize them. I can wear whatever I want (casual outfit)

So here is where the story starts. I went to work and did my thing but than I saw a girl with a blue shirt. She started working at 4.45pm. She was talking with an lady so she was standing with her back against me. I had to clean the table so its was quite a coincidence. I said hey and she introduce herself to me. We had a quick chat about when she started to work and she asked some things back. 

The people eat at 5.00pm so I helped the nurses and she helped aswell. After that I said if she is hungry you can grab some food. We had little chats and she laughed a couple of times and we were just having a conversation about school and stuff. I offered her some drinks and after that we watched tv with all the eldery who live there. 

I served the people some drinks and she offered to help me and so she did.

Later she was on her phone and I goofed about that I have to do everything (totally not a problem) she offered to help and I said im fine with a big smile and later we had a chat.

She wasnt avoiding me and she was very kind and beautiful. The first impressions were great. The problem is that the vacation workers are flex workers in the evening but they do have a morning schedule. I dont know when I am going to see her again because I only work in the evenings.

I also dont know if she has a boyfriend or not so thats also kinda a thing.

I have no relationship/dating experience and sometimes I'm quite insecure. Sorry for bad english.

I really want to know her surname and maybe phonen number but I dont want to be a creep so I have to to it smart. Any suggestions?

There are a few guys who still give her free stuff because there into her, she doesn’t flirt with them or lead them on anymore but I still don’t like it. for example there’s a guy who she’s getting free stuff from but he said she has to hang out with him for an hour. he is 3 years older and lives almost an hour away. This really freaks me out because

1) he lives a fucking hour away and is driving all the way to give someone free drugs

2) he said she HAS to hang out with him for an hour or he won’t give her anything.

3)he is 19 while she just turned 16

I don’t know what i’m supposed to do because she is planning on doing it and i have voiced my concern to her. she said she needs it by tomorrow and it’s her only way because she doesn’t get paid until saturday. she agrees that it’s creepy but is still doing it. Should I let this be bothering me as much as it is? Is there anything I should say to convince her to not go?

Edit: I convinced her so we’re good, i was scared to bring up the rape thing because of things. But when i voiced that she understood 

Sorry for all the people this annoyed the hell out of lmao. i understand we are both stupid teenagers.

also, this doesn’t happen often at all, it’s happened one other time in the 10 months we’ve been dating and that time it was dropped off.",relationship_advice

t3_chp041,My boyfriend is freaking out,My(22F) boyfriend(24M) is freaking out because there is a good chance that he is going to fail a required class for his degree program. If he fails he is likely to be asked to leave the program. The main stressor is that his current job is stipulated on him completing his degree. If he loses his job his apartment and car would follow and he would be in a lot of student debt. I don't know how to best support him in this. He continues to talk in a way that frightens me and I worry that he will do something drastic that would cause harm to himself. I don't want him to stop talking to me about what he's going through but it is very difficult and slightly triggering for me. I just don't know what to do or how to help him.

t3_chozxi,Should I confess or leave him alone?,"There's a boy i like. we were friends 2 years back but decided to part our ways after a month due to some reason. He even suggested that we should stay as stranger from then. He was in a relationship at that time. We started talking again from last 4 days. I got to know that they broke up and that he regrets what happened between us in the past (we kissed a couple of times). 

Right now he's very sad and became a bit self consumed. He does not have any problem when i talk to him. We enjoy a lot when we talk to each other right now. he also said that he feels sad about suggesting me to be strangers and that we have a bit of similarities (he said i was the first one of that kind in his life).

I want to know that-

1. should i confess to him that i like him and that we should consider being in a relationship.
2. should i just stop talking to him so that he forgets about me and feel less burden about us.",relationship_advice
t3_chozqe,"I (F,20) didnt greet my father (M,57) on his birthday.","Little backstory.

My father and I have a complicated relationship. Since I inherited his lack of patience and ego, we always fight. We never really had a common ground when we fight. Usually we never really resolved things by talking. It always ended with him getting physical or verbally aggressive with me. When i was younger, naturally my angsty teenage brain didnt understand why parents get mad for simple things. Of course now that I am 20, i try to see things their way. 

My father was born poor but he strived to carry his own weight and achieve in life. I guess that's where some of his pride come from. He really did great though. Travelled Europe and most parts of our country, all expenses paid by his employers. When i was in highschool, his company went bankrupt. He didnt find work for a long time but he always manage to help around the house or give money. Me and my sister didnt really mind yknow. Since my mom had a huge steady income. But I felt like sometimes he feels low because he isnt the one providing the bigger income or doing ""women work"" around the house. Sometimes he projects his insecurities unto us.


Whenever we fight, I try to calm down and talk to him. But the ""I am your father talking back to me is disrespect"" card is always used. I dont have any problems like this with my mother. When we fight, we usually talk sincerely with each other and help each other understand both sides.

Recently, we had a big fight. I tried to talk to him calmly and rationally so that I could understand why he was so angry. But nothing changed, he still spoke to me as if i was just a child, threatened to take my dog away and disown me. It ended with me crying in my room for a long time. Trying to figure out why I had such a compicated father.

Yesterday was his birthday and since our fight was still fresh. I didn't greet him when I came back home from school. My mom is now texting to me and my sister why didnt do so and it was such a huge thing for her and my father. 

I want to make peace and have a better relationship with my father. But if talking with him won't work, i dont know what else will. 

Any advice?

Tldr: My dad and i had a huge fight a few days before his birthday, neither me or my sister greeted him.",relationship_advice
t3_chehrx,I’m (26M) slowly loosing interest in my newly married wife (22F),"I’m writing this with an heavy heart hoping to find a way to over come my struggle. I know that I might be the asshole here but I want to find a solution for this ongoing issue that I can’t open up to anyone I personally know. 

Me and wife got married recently about 10 months ago, after 1 year of dating. I know it’s a short time but we were so happy with each other and decided to get married. I don’t wanna disclose our names but here’s a little about us, I’m 27, have a Graduate Engineering degree, a decent job, not religious or you could say an agnostic atheist, kinda nerdy and liberal. My wife is 22, she’s from a very conservative family (No make ups, skirt wearing and God is everything motto), didn’t go to school after 5th grade and had a very bad childhood cos of her stepmom. She isn’t religious  and she’s kind of a rebel in her family, She’s very naive but smokes weed which her family hated and has been dealing with depression and anxiety issues. She haven’t been in a serious relationship before me  while I had been in a 4 year and 3 years relationship before I met her. She is a big girl and was 250 lbs when we dated and I’m 145lbs. We have a lot of differences but opposite poles attracts each other. 

The things I didn’t know about her are that she’s a little jealous, has deep insecurities about her weight and although she isn’t religious I didn’t realize she had those roots in her. Fast forwards to after marriage, she slowly brought up about her discomfort with me watching music videos cos of the short dresses girls wear in those and wanted me to watch only the lyrical videos. I don’t care for those girls or nudity but I was shocked to know that she has issues with that. Then it progressed into a big fight when she asked me to give up on my favorite tv show the Game of Thrones cos of the nudity in that. She pretty much accused me of being a pervert for watching shameless. It really bothered me cos she knew Hame of Thrones was my fav show right since when we dated and that I had been waiting for the final season for a couple of years only to ask me to give up on it. So now I’m not allowed to watch most of the tv shows and music if there’s a girl with some level of nudity. Pretty much my wife has put a parental control on me at the age of 27. 

Although I was totally furious about that, we sat and spoke and I learned that this was cos of her insecurities and she feels deeply hurt when I come across other naked women and that it makes her feel like she’s not good enough. So I agreed on giving up on that as she’s far more important than a tv show although it hurt me cos of the way she was looking at things. While all of this is happening, we had a few fights when I tried to ask her about her weight and encouraged her to loose weight. She refused to tell me her weight until recently and gets deeply upset if I ask about it. In my view, that’s a main reason for her insecurities and I would like her to work on it. 

This is when all the problems started. Health wise, she has been facing issues with cavities cos of her soda or sweet tea habits. So I asked her to reduce that and switch to water. We had to have 2 of her teeth’s crowned in this one year and the dentist advised her the same. That didn’t go well. Secondly she is 22 and has knee pains and back pains, and again I have asked her to go to gym with me and I’ll help her to work out with me. She agreed, and I bought her a membership and had been paying for it ever since, but she didn’t go after the first 3 days. I didn’t go well again when I asked her to go after that. While health wise we had these issues, sexually our relationship started declining drastically. She gained a few more now and is about 275lbs. I don’t wanna get into the details, but we can’t have sex in any other but one sex position cos of her overweight. It really took a turn on me. So I got depressed and finally one day opened up to her about it. That day she agreed with everything I said and said she will work on it. But then never did anything, and when I asked about it she got very upset and threw a “ You married me for what I’m, don’t try to change me”, after entirely changing my hobbies to the shows I watch. I don’t expect her to loose weight and turn 180 lbs over night or be a model or anything. But I do expect her to give up on some bad habits like eating ice creams every night, constantly being on sugar waters like Sweet tea and smoking weed every night and ending up eating a bunch of deserts. Nothing of this worked when I directly told her to do something about it. She either ignores it or cries when I say anything about this. All of this made me sexually loose interest in her entirely and I’m guilty enough to say that she doesn’t turn me on a bit. Our sex lives sucks at this point, as she’s a girl with high sex drive only to me be not interested in her. We are aware of the issues we have sexually, but I have not told her that I’m not interested in her and had been giving reasons like I’m tired every time she asks for sex. I don’t even know what to do and where to go from here. I don’t know if I should change and accept the way she is or if I’m being an complete asshole for asking her to loose weight. Despite all of this, I love her to the core and she loves me more than anything. We both still want to live with each other and have no intentions of leaving each other but I don’t know how long I can go like this. Sorry for the long posts but I would really appreciate any advices. TIA.",relationship_advice
t3_chnbpg,How to repair and proceed with damaged relationship ?,"So last year in Toronto (where I live) I met this awesome girl (23) from Holland who comes to Toronto every summer to see family. I only got to chill with her the final 2 weeks of august, but every time we were together it was so genuine and fun. After the first date, she was basically hooked to me. Her friends would ask if she wanted to hang out, but she always carved out time for me over them which is weird because I only had 1 date with this chick. Guess I got her attention :) Before she left back to holland, I told
her we should be exclusive when she comes back (in summer 19’) and she was down with it. 

This where I made the mistake🤦🏻‍♂️. I told my friends that we hooked up and basically boasted about it because they’re all like she’s so hot! It’s felt awesome getting the validation of “damn you got with here?!😮😏👌🏻”

Fast-forward to the past 3 weeks, she’s back and catches wind of the word that spread and is super pissed saying I’m disrespectful and such and such. I continue to deny I told people anything.. 

What should I do??? I don’t want to waste this opportunity again.",relationship_advice
t3_ch9wl1,Am I [28M] wrong to have left her [25F]?,"Dated a girl for 5 years and just left her a few weeks ago because we never had sex. It was too much to go through more than half my twenties without sex. She would routinely say things like ""Idk I just don't see the point or feel the need"" which made me sick to my stomach. She said she eventually want kids but throughout the nearly 6 years of hanging out and 5 years of dating the furthest we have gotten is oral which she thoroughly disliked. Basically the last year of our relationship was just talking about sex and nothing else and I decided I was literally just bored of it.   


The catch is she's literally perfect besides what's written above. She's never mean, super attractive and fit, incredibly loyal (probably in part because she doesn't like sex), friendly, fun to hang out with, easy to please, lives the same lifestyle as me (simple and minimalistic), clean, organized, smart, etc. I told her so many times that I am not able to stay if she's not going to have sex and she just kept saying ""someday we will"".

I'm not sure what to do Im not really enjoying engineering 100% rn either.,relationship_advice
t3_chowdn,She missed the birthday party :(,"So this has been going on for a year. My MIL lost her job, doesn’t contribute to any household chores and wakes up at 4 or 5 pm. Her spouse literally does everything for her (from cooking to brushing her hair). She missed her granddaughter’s first birthday party last week because she literally takes 7 hours to do anything and just sits and plays on her phone. 

The day after she missed my daughter’s party she asks like nothing is wrong. She has been prescribed antidepressants but barely takes them/takes them inconsistently and won’t go to talk to someone. 

What do we do? Stage an intervention? It’s really hard to be sympathetic and compassionate when she can’t even muster the energy to take the pills that might make her feel better.",relationship_advice
t3_chov9f,I moved to a different country to live with my bf and now we are having troubles.,"I (F18) moved from NYC to Belgium to live with my bf (M21). We met online through a social platform and I fell in love with him really quickly. He was such an amazing guy. July of 2018 he flew to meet me in person and it was the best month of my life. About 8 months after the visit I decided I want to move to live with him in Belgium. My parents weren't too happy with that because I'm so young and I've never even been to the country and if I made a mistake there was no way I could go back to the US to be with my parents again.

&amp;#x200B;

Important note about myself: I was born in Israel and me and my parents moved to NYC when I was 3 so we were illegal immigrants in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

A main reason why I really wanted to move was because things back home weren't going very well. My mother and I never had the best relationship and she was mentally and physically abusive towards me, so when my bf offered for me to move and legally live with him, I couldn't say no. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, when I moved to Belgium it was tough but I got used to it. But day by day me and my bf have an insane amount of fights. He really really insults me and he hurts my feelings and he claims i'm lying to him even though his memory is really bad because he has ADHD. He has never complimented me and he doesn't really show affection towards me. He's never bought me flowers despite the amount of times that I hinted at it or even asked him if he would be able to. He comes home from work and he goes right on his computer to play video games. And the thing that scares me the most is how violent and aggressive he is. He would smash his fists against the table, insult me and threaten to bash my skull in and knock my teeth out. Now yes, some fights we have do go out of hand and I insult him back but he takes things way too far and i'm really afraid that one day he may actually bash my skull in. He is a really aggressive person and it takes me back to how I lived back with my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we are on the process of having me legalized here in Belgium which is great but now I'm really stuck. I don't feel comfortable being around him.. I can't go back to America because they wouldn't let me go back considering I don't have a US passport and Israel will deny me a visa since I lived there illegally. I also can't go back to Israel because I have no family there and I don't know the language or the country itself and if I do go back to Israel then I won't be able to see my parents in over 10 years. I also have no friends here in Belgium that I can go to, to get away. I am stuck. I don't know what to do. We would make up but then he would get furious at me again and the insults and threats continue. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- I moved to Belgium from NYC to live with my bf I was in love with to get away from my toxic home and now my bf is being super aggressive and threatening towards me and I can't leave because I don't have a US passport and I can't go to my home country because I have no family there.",relationship_advice
t3_chn8bw,Is my [20M] girlfriend [19F] crazy or am I?,"Very long post, TL;DR at the bottom.


So me and my girlfriend have been together for almost a year and a half now and since the beginning we had our differences. She has a really volcanic temperament and tends to get really angry from small things (for example, at some point me and some friends were waiting for her to finish her cigarette and get in the car and I said ""see, if u didn't smoke we could have gone by now"" in a playful way, just to make conversation (note that I don't mind her smoking one bit, and she knows that) but she got really mad and didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and the next day until I apologized for like 100 times. We always fight from the most stupid things and I kind of got used to it until some really odd stuff happened since two or three months ago. Now that you got the general idea bear with me because it's only going south from here.

One of the biggest and weirdest fights we had was about me not minding gay people and her pretty much hating them. When I was around 13-14 years old I had to kiss a boy in a dare game and I've always been cool with relationship between the same sexes (note that I am 100% straight). We had a little debate about why we have these opinions and during the conversation I brought up the experience mentioned above. This led to us almost breaking up just because I had a different opinion that hers and because she couldn't accept my past (I had no problem with her opinion though and I just wanted to understand her reasoning but it escalated beyond expectations). We somehow managed to fix it after two or three days of fighting and moved on. I hoped that we established that I am completely straight after this whole ruckus but boy was I mistaken. 

One of my friends needed some advice regarding a girl he liked, so during a week we met two or three times around 12am in our neighborhood so we could talk about how things are going between them and what he should or shouldn't do. I told my girlfriend every time what I was doing, where I was and with who. In the last meeting I had with my friend I got caught up in the discussion and I forgot to respond to her messages for about an hour or so. When I got home, I apologized but, now get ready for this one, she accused me for being gay with my friend. I thought she was joking at first but she was dead serious. I tried to explain that is utterly untrue but again, we ended up fighting for a day or two before fixing it. 

Now for a change of pace. We  got together to go at my place. On the way to the subway, we had an argument. I can't really remember about what but I remember it was really insignificant. During arguments I tend to not get angry and just try to make the other person understand my point of view and why I think theirs is wrong (I am totally ready to accept I am mistaken if they prove me, of course). During the argument at some point, she says ""ok I am going home if you don't stop"". She looked pretty serious so I told her that it's just a contradictory discussion about something not important, even if we don't agree it doesn't mean you have to react like that. After asking her not to go for a few times she proceeds with  leaving. I was kind of bamboozled because it got out of my hands real quick. After thinking for a minute or two I ran after her and at that moment I kinda lost it. I caught up to her, stopped her and started the most brutal rage in my life I think. I started screaming at her that I don't think this is normal and I think she shouldn't run from her problems, and that if something bothers her we should try and fix it, talk about it, not just give up and not talk with each other.   I think this was not ok from my side either, I mean, we were in middle of the street and people were watching me screaming at my girlfriend but I couldn't control myself. I hugged her and apologies after but it really pissed me off in that moment. We worked through this one too. But a few days ago I think this was my last drop.

So I was away in another city on a workshop with my university and I thought maybe she and my friends could come at the end of my workshop and spend another day here. All nice and well until we had to find a place to stay.We all wanted to take a room for all 4 of us but my girlfriend insisted on having a separate room with me so we could have sex. I told her I want that too but I was a little short on money so I asked her to go with the bigger room because it was more advantageous and when we get home we'll have all the sex she wants.  I guess you can already figure out she didn't take it so well. After literally begging her not to, she cancelled the whole trip just because this reason. ""Ok, if that's what you wish and I can't convince you cancel it and I'll see you when I come back...I am really sorry and I wish you would've come though"" is what I said. After a day or two from this incident we had another argument about something unimportant after which she said ""everything you do annoys me, change or we won't work"". This really opened my  eyes. She always tried to change me more or less but I just hoped she will someday accept me as who I am. But I am really sick of this. I am sure we can work this one out too, but I made up my mind and I wanna break up with her because it's getting really toxic for both of us and I think it would be better like this. What do you guys think?


TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend are fighting a lot from unimportant stuff and I am thinking about leaving her because it would be better for both of us. She accused me for being gay and cheating on her with my friend, she never tries to talk about our problems and she doesn't accept who I am.",relationship_advice
t3_chosoj,Can I salvage my relationship?,"I’ve (17m) been dating my girlfriend (15f) for a few months now and mostly everything is fine, with the exception of my ex girlfriend (17f). A few months ago, I broke up with her and almost immediately entered a new relationship. There’s still emotional baggage there and while my current girl friend is gone for the entire summer, I’ve been hanging out with my ex girlfriend as friends. 

I haven’t cheated, but like I said I don’t think we’re completely over each other, despite making sure not to cheat. I know, it’s bad and I should probably stop hanging out with her altogether for now. 

Anyway, yesterday I was with my ex walking around, saw my girlfriends friends, and broke off with my ex gf, to avoid conflict or drama. Of course, they saw that and obviously it looks very suspicious and told my girlfriend all about it... 

I know I’m stupid for panicking and breaking away, and stupid for just trying to be my ex girlfriend’s friend, but it’s not like I cheated or did anything too bad... 

I love my girlfriend and she’s very angry and upset, as you’d expect. Should I tell her anything? Or should I leave her alone and accept whatever she decides?

t3_chor7p,How do I get over this one kiss?,"Ok, so here we go. My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years after one year the distance became long-distance. Reddit, I don't know what else to say, I know people are gonna say it's the typical cheesy story and all that bs. The cheesy stuff is cheesy because it's true. She's smart funny and we love all the same stuff down to the really weird stuff like favorite insane YouTubers and all that. I've always told her communication is key and we've been pretty good about it. On and off for the past two long-distance years, she and I have had stupid, petty fights that we knew were dumb and we would never have in person. In-person we're amazing as well as the distance, I imagine though that it's natural for us to get into these petty fights due to the frustration of being long-distance. That's why we always came back and brushed them off. The thing is Reddit, we had a petty fight last week that reached a place it shouldn't have and then she broke up with me but it was a break up during the heat of the argument that I felt she didn't mean.

We gave each other some space for about a week and then after a week, it was her birthday. I sent her a birthday text and she simply ""loved it"" as in the message and then sent ""thank you, love you too"" I couldn't take it anymore, I texted her and for some reason she just kept telling me to move on and I kept thinking how is it that after a week she's speaking to me like I'm some stranger? Then she proceeded to call herself a shitty person and that I deserve better. I kinda kept pushing with my words as in I just kept kinda asking why she was acting like this and I told her she's the only one for me. She got mad and said I always put her on a pedestal and she's a shitty person and not as great as I think she is. Reddit she and I are good loyal people, and the thing is, her life after she had to move is not a great one, she graduated, moved away from all her friends, she is now working two jobs and paying off loans, her parents are always fighting and her dad is a very strict and religious dad who basically doesn't let her have a life at all. She even told me how she thinks she's a shitty person because of how much she's lied to her dad and the reason she lies to him is about stuff like going out and all that. Her dad is a control freak and that was something we also bonded over, our parents never let us do anything in high school and in college, we only got a smaller amount of freedom opposed to that. She has very few friends and yeah barely ever hangs out with those friends as it is. She is constantly paranoid of her dad finding out about us. It's messed up because sadly her household is one where the dad's approval is what matters, her mother and sisters know about me and love me. This made her love for me even stronger.

After I texted and pushed her enough because I was so confused and not about to let it end like that, she finally came out and sent a long text that started out with ""I let another guy kiss me"" she said she regretted it the second it happened, she only has feelings for me, she felt like shit, she's disgusted with herself and hates herself, and she was questioning how could I be with someone like her. Reddit idk if anyone else feels this way but the last fucking thing I wanted to know were the details but I still had to ask for some sort of closure, I asked how and where did it happen, she said he snagged one from her just before she and her girl friend were leaving. I asked how long it was and all that crap and she said not long but she wanted to stop talking about it because it made her feel gross. I respected that and I told her that it was ok, it was just a kiss. She doubts that I'm this calm with it but she said she hopes I keep true to my promises and never bring it up or any of that. Guys, I love her so much and she's living and incredibly hard life out there, and technically she and I were broken up for a week and it happened about two days before I texted her again and we had this conversation. Reddit I feel like I made the right decision but how do I get the thoughts of this asshole kissing her? He's into her and she said she's not going to entertain him or let him believe he has any chances. How do I get myself over this one little kiss? She's going through a lot and the last thing I want to do is dump her and make her mental health even more unstable than it is. I don't want to break up with her, she's the one for me, but how do I get this one little kiss out of my head? How do I stop letting these thoughts take over? I can't stop the paranoid thoughts of her maybe secretly enjoying that kiss? I can't stop thinking about how trust was kind of broken but I guess technically we were broken up, it's obviously just irritating because it was literally five days after we broke up and we usually come back to one another. She said she let him kiss her but he kinda just went for it and caught her off guard, she didn't insinuate it or anything. In her long text she kept telling me how awful she felt and that she recognizes how I only want her but she was having slight doubts about us and then after that she asked me how could I want to be with someone like that?  This isn't something that I ever thought we would have to deal with. I know that technically trust isn't broken, she once felt guilty and facetimed me one day about a work party the night before where a guy tried to get a kiss from her but she backed off and said she has a bf. She facetimed me telling me that and said she didn't want to keep anything. Guys what do I do, I don't want to let her go and she doesn't want me to either, I handled the situation in a mature manner but that was through texting, texting doesn't show my inner thoughts.

Has he lost interest?,"I met a guy back in April after we both recently got out of 2 year relationships. We hooked up the night be met and then we continued a confusing relationship from then on. It was confusing bc we never talked about what we were; we would do date-like activities but also we were not exclusive. He did ask me what my relationship goals are tho and I said I can’t think about anything serious for a few months and he agreed. He genuinely got to know me tho and it seemed like he cared about me. He even said once “If we ever stop hooking up promise me that we will stay friends.” 

Right now we aren’t close to each other bc I live in NY and he lives in CT. His family is a military family so he moves around a lot. He told me he was lonely bc he doesn’t know anyone in his neighborhood and there aren’t many places to meet new people. Recently, he told me he reconnected with two girls from his childhood so maybe he is hanging out with them but I’m not sure if they live close. Anyway, the point is I know he doesn’t have many friends so it’s confusing to me why he is just randomly ignoring me. We’ve seen each other 2 times this summer and I thought it went well. But shortly after the second time I saw him, he dramatically decreased his contact with me. Previously he had been texting me everyday but then he reduced it to once a week. I noticed this and I took a hint and stopped trying to initiate contact as much. He would then snapchat me something random I guess to contact me but then I’d try to continue a conversation and we would go back and forth 2-3 times and then he would leave me on open. 

Now, I snap chatted him last Friday and he still hasn’t opened it. I’m honestly kind of offended bc I’ve seen he has been on snapchat and he is just blatantly ignoring me. He doesn’t use social media a lot so I know my notification is prob like the second or third from the top. Has he lost interest in me? Is he trying to get me to take a hint? What should I do? 

Also is it dramatic that I kinda just want to cut off contact with him? ***Something important to note: he knows my ex ghosted me at the end of our relationship so I think what he is doing is shitty and is why I’m so offended***",relationship_advice
t3_chn5jr,Where to start..,"

A TLDR to start cause literally no one will read this:
My best friend was catfished by another friend who’s also a petty criminal, they’re hanging out a lot and it’s all my friend can talk about and I can’t fucking stand it. 

I (26f) have this friend (26f-we’ll say Rachel) whom I’ve been best friends with for quite some time. We’ve had our ups and downs but I biggest down was due to a disagreement about another friend (25f-we’ll say trish). 

Rachel and I have been really good friends for a really long time, and halfway through that time, Rachel was introduced to trish. Trish was into a very different lifestyle than I was, partying nonstop, getting likes on social media, living large. She was also into a lot of petty crime. Stealing from stores, workplaces, returning items for cash that she stole, empty envelopes into the atm, other small things that don’t make her a fugitive on America’s most wanted, but they don’t make her a very good person either. 


I got along with trish to save face, but never really liked her. And then, trish stole from me. She stole 300$ cold hard cash in a situation where all signs pointed to her being the only positive culprit, not even considering her history. The only possible thing that would’ve happened, was her taking it out of my wallet. 



Now, Rachel didn’t believe me when I asked her about my missing money and I asked if it could’ve been trish. I asked Rachel if she’d ask trish, and she did, but of course trish denied. Anyways, yadda yadda fast forward; Rachel has Trishs back and won’t let up and decides that trish is more worthy of her friendship than I.



Fine, we part ways. 




Fast forward again, maybe 6 months. Rachel reaches out, we mend fences. She’s still friends with trish, I do my best to swallow it. She’s also been talking to this guy for a while (jack) and he’s friends with trish and trish also has a dude (John) who’s friends with other dude and it all seems.... convenient. 




I do some research about jack and John and things aren’t adding up. Jack tells a lot of really crazy stories about traveling the world, going to Europe for just a weekend trip, but somehow doesn’t have a reachable cell phone number. Jack makes a lot of plans to meet with Rachel but they always somehow fall through; and for absolutely ludicrous reasons. “I saw you from across the room but I tripped and split my skull open and I’ll be fine but I had to leave.” Hmm ya, ok Jack. 



Rachel fucking believes it all. I show Rachel all these red flags, Rachel sees no flags in this very picture perfect classic catfish tale, and continues her romance. Trish continues her communication with both jack and John and a few other suspecting profiles on Facebook. 




So reverse google image search finally finds that jack and John are not who they say they are. The pictures jack has been sending Rachel, as well as the pictures of John, are actually Swedish TV stars who are friends IRL and living it up in Sweden. I finally have hard evidence to prove to Rachel that this is a catfish and something in my gut tells me its actually trish. 




Well folks, shockingly (not shockingly) it was trish. She was behind jack and John and about 6 other profiles communicating with Rachel. It’s super fucked up. Trish was Rachel’s internet love interest for the better part of a year. I think it’s pretty sick, Rachel doesn’t love it either and decides to cut ties with trish. I breathe a sigh of relief, this crazy woman is gone, I can have my friend back, life is good. 




A few other catfishes pop up after they’re split and they’re all trish, once again. Rachel doesn’t bat an eye, I still can’t believe how psycho obsessed Trish is with Rachel, but it’s all harmless enough I guess. But fast forward I think maybe 2 years, trish finally reaches out as herself and asks Rachel to meet up and begs for forgiveness. Rachel’s a good person and she does it. 



Things go fine, maybe even great! Because they start being friends again. More time passes and Rachel talks very poorly of Trish to me, maybe because it appeases me, maybe because trish is a piece of shit, who knows. Some more time passes, they don’t really spend a lot of time together, it doesn’t particularly bother me, life’s great. I move cities, a somewhat long distance away. 



Fast forward some more time and Rachel is single from her long term boyfriend. Rachel’s looking to get a little wild. In steps trish once again. They’re hanging out nonstop, living it up. Trish has even introduced Rachel to a real boy (Todd) who’s the apple of Rachel’s eye now. They’re all inseparable. 



Here comes the dilemma. I am in a different city than them both and it boils my blood to the point of explosion to hear anything about Trish or Todd. I don’t know how to be friends with Rachel when all she talks about is Trish when I know the things Trish has done to not only her, but me, her family and many other unsuspecting people. Obviously Rachel is over it, why can’t I be? 




How can I be Rachel’s friend and support her in her budding relationship with Todd and just sit there and hear her talk about how fun and amazing Trish is? How is it that Trish and I are on the same friendship level to Rachel?

How do I get the fuck over myself???

t3_chlm1v,"F18, friends disapprove of recent decision.","Hi! I’m 18, and my boyfriend, M, is 20. We’ve been together for six years this past April, started dating when we were 12 and 14. 

I moved out when I was 16 and he moved out at 18 that same year but we both moved into separate flats as we agreed it would be good to be properly independent and such, instead of moving straight from parents homes into OUR home. 
It’s been two years living alone and we’ve found a flat we love, close to both of our schools and jobs. We’re very excited to move in together!

However, some of MY friends think that it’s too soon and that we’re wasting “our precious youth” on being in a long term relationship this young and moving into together “so soon”. They’ve said numerous other things but I’ll keep it short. 

My question is, does it seem too soon? I know it’s our decision, but I’d like to see how someone outside of the relationship views it.

QUICK EDIT: Obviously, at the start of our relationship, it was a childlike and not mature relationship and it matured and developed as we grew up. I moved out at 16 because of issues at home.",relationship_advice
t3_chomv4,My girlfriend is so terribly rude to me when she goes out drinking. What should I do?,"My girlfriend (23F) is really rude to me (24M)  when she gets drunk. It honestly feels like I’m dating a 16 year old. Last night was by far the worst. We are preparing to move across country next week so there is a lot to get done to pack up all of our stuff. Her team at work has just completed a large project and an event was organized to celebrate (concerning to me as every time her work group goes to celebrate I see the same behaviour from her). So as to no surprise this time around, as I spend the entire evening packing up our kitchen, she was out getting absolutely wasted. At around 10pm I hadn’t heard from her in 3 hours. I decided to go for a 20 min run and let her know via text and that I wouldn’t be bringing my phone. I come back from my run to see a bunch of angry messages from her saying “how could you not bring your phone while I’m out drinking?” and that she wanted me to come pick her up.

So I try to call and text her to see where she is so I can come get her but she is totally ignoring my calls/texts. It’s about 10:30 now and I’m feeling exhausted and just want to go to bed, we have to work in the morning and still have a lot to prepare for our move. Over the course of a few hours I wait and continue to do some packing, occasionally trying to call her text her and all I get is some hang ups on the phone. She did answer it once to tell me she was going to a different bar down the street (at midnight) and when I told her it was time to come home she just said she had to go and hung up on me. I could clearly tell she was very drunk.

So I have no idea where she actually is and she stops answering any of my calls/texts. So I go to bed. 2am rolls around and she calls me for a ride. I go pick her up and as she usually is, she’s so rude to me. In my mind I’m understandably frustrated with how the night has gone but she’s so drunk and repeatedly calls me a selfish a\*\*h\*\*\*. She starts telling me my job is a joke and keeps going on and on about how great her work group is, how she got offered a job from a drunk old rich guy who is one of their clients, etc. She refuses to go in the house when we get home because apparently I’m still being an a\*\*h\*\*\*. She eventually passes out in the car, I try to carry her into the house but she wakes up and starts freaking out on me saying I’m hurting her.

We finally get into the house and all she has to say as she walks by the numerous boxes that I’ve packed that evening is “looks like you did f\*\*\* all tonight, literally.” At this point I just can’t believe what’s going on and I start crying and all she says to me is that I’m a f\*\*\*ing joke before she passes out in bed.

This is not the first time that this behavior has happened. It happens every time she goes out drinking without me. And she always gets super drunk. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to say I don’t want my girlfriend to go out and have a good time, her team really did deserve to celebrate after completing the project, but I just can’t take the way she treats me when I pick her up. Not only does she not appreciate at all that I came to pick her up at 2am and spent my whole evening packing while she was drinking, she’s just so rude to me. And we’ve talked about it before but she always plays it off like it’s not a big deal and that she’s sorry and was just drunk. I’m just so broken, I feel like she’s just a totally different person in these situations and it’s hard for me to believe she’s my girlfriend. I don’t know what to do. I know she never acts or says these things sober, but I don't even understand where these thoughts come from when she's drunk.",relationship_advice
t3_chfsxx,[RANT] My (20F) boyfriend’s (24M) baby-mama (22F) FUCKING SUCKS.,"I can’t even put into WORDS how much I HATE her. 

It’s not even a jealousy thing (she seems to think it is), it’s literally her lazy and atrocious “parenting” that makes me hate her. 

Before she got pregnant, she was addicted to heroin and cheating on (let’s call him Zac) and fucking tons of dudes behind his back, while being totally abusive and controlling to him (he told me she’s hit him before).  After having the child, she was in and out of rehab multiple times. She was about to sign him over but her mom talked her out of it. My boyfriend even drove to her rehab to have her sign the papers. 

When I first started seeing Zac, she only took their son a few times every few months, and showed absolutely no interest whatsoever in being a mom unless it was for a facebook post or snapchat.  She had a new boyfriend and all she cared about was him and HIS daughter.  She told Zac she couldn’t get off heroin for him, her parents, or her fucking toddler son, but this new boyfriend was the only person who made her want to get off heroin. (WHO SAYS THAT) 

She takes weeks to pay him for their sons school. (it’s literally $65/mo) and tries to claim him on tax forms while contributing literally nothing, no money and barely any care. 

It took 4 years for her to get her own car seat for him, and only did because my boyfriend took his to work with him instead of leaving it for her to use. 

She started seeing him more often (thursday-sunday) pretty regularly, but this week she took him wednesday night-friday afternoon and on sunday for a few hours. She put off coming to pick him up because she was “really busy” and came to pick him up with her boyfriends daughter and dropped him off as soon as possible, again, with his daughter.  He comes back and says he’s bored at mamas house which is heartbreaking because he’s sooo easy to entertain, as long as you pay attention to him and participate he has a blast.  

on top of this, she’s put him in pull ups (he’s potty trained) because she ‘doesn’t want to wash underwear every week’ and has told him to back talk his father. 

she’s lazy, doesn’t have a job, and cares more about her boyfriends daughter than her own son. 

all of this and she also sometimes flirts with my boyfriend saying she ‘misses their little family’ and she wishes things were different and sending him song lyrics about heartbreak and missing your ex. 

It breaks my heart because i love that kid like he’s my own.  He’s the sweetest kid ever. If music is on for a second he starts dancing, he makes up his own songs to sing. Sometimes I wish I would’ve met him years ago so it could’ve been me instead, so the kid could have both parents actually give a shit and put in effort. I play with him, take him for walks / treats / activities, a ton of his drawings are on my wall, we draw together, i watch him when everyone’s busy.  We both actively help him learn to read and write. I’ve taken him to the store and let him pick out a toy, my mom gives him gifts for christmas (she lives across the country and sends him cards and presents in the mail) 

He won’t take her to court because money/he doesn’t want to put his kid through that because he’s really young   it’s a lot of us being the better person and taking the high road. I just needed to vent because I don’t like talking about it to him because of course he gets upset and stressed. 

TLDR: my boyfriends baby mother is a deadbeat and i love their son to pieces and wish she would just admit that she doesn’t care and fucking leave us all alone.

t3_chok6i,How to deal with my colleague who stays flirty after being rejected,"Hello everyone,

So there's this guy (30-ish M) at my (24M) company who began on the same day as me. He was immediately being flirty but as I struggle to firmly reject people and as he just arrived in the country knowing absolutely no one, I basically laughed it off every time it became too obvious.

Fast forward to the company party in winter : I take all my courage and told him I sensed he was attracted to me and I was straight so that's a no. As awkward as I can be, I went on with telling him I still thought he was nice as a person and we could have a drink (at the company party we were attending). Mistake or not ? I honestly don't know.

With time flying, it became less and less awkward. The message had been sent and seemed to be received. He's still new in the city so when he began to ask me what I was doing on weekends, I once told him about an event my association was organizing. He got there, got very drunk, and told to my face stuff like ""I know you're straight but I really wanna kiss right now haha"". Yup. Well, not gonna happen. Let's get back to the conversation we were having and laugh that shit off. A lot of friends who were there later told me about my ""weird friend who doesn't seems to understand the concept of personal space""(men and women).

So it became awkward again and it is since. Minor events like him texting me on the company chat like ""you told me you were straight, right ?"". Yes I did told you I was straight. He also use to kind of randomly demand hugs to say hi we see each other in the cafeteria or during breaks, which is kinda hard to avoid and that I tolerate as it is harmless to me. Rejecting someone like that in public in front of other colleagues would be so awkward I prefer taking it...

Lastly, this week he invited me to a meeting so I could explain to him my job, which he could take in account to be better at his own job. My job and his are not even closely related so it was clearly about finding an excuse to see me. I accepted the meeting at first as it is his usual harmless shit, but then I told my direct colleagues about that and they all told me that this is ridiculous and I shouldn’t accept this so called meeting which sounds more like a date. I figured it was time to get free of this shit and cancelled the meeting, saying I was busy, and sent him a message telling him that I didn't understand this sudden interest as our jobs are not related, advising him a similar team who may be related to his job to ask his questions.

So I played his game and answered him in a professional way, which actually meant ""stop trying to find excuses to see me, and if you're really interested in this kind of job, them over here are your guys.""

I'd like him to understand that no means no and staying flirty after he heard the first no isn't at all appropriate, and I don't feel good in this situation. 

Somehow I'm thinking that if he was a straight guy, and I was as straight girl, that would be labelled as clear harassment.",relationship_advice
t3_chkckz,I want to break up with my 18M financially irresponsible girlfriend 18F. Do you agree? How should I approach her with this?,"Background - we're both 18, in an american university, both as international students. I'm broke just like most college students but she comes from an affluent family.

And my GF is very irresponsible about money. She comes from a non-western country so perhaps it's a cultural difference, but she made like several K loan to her older friend right after we met, and because of that and her impulse spending, she is always in short of money. So naturally I have to cover up sometimes. When we pay for anything, normally we split unless it's a special occasion. But because we don't carry cash, one of us pays and we electronically transfer the money to another. When she pays, I return the money instantly, always within 2 hours. Normally at the spot. When I pay though, she would take days, and normally won't return me the money until I ask for it. This happens a lot when she want to impulse buy and doesnt have money so I pay for her. She never gives me back the money without me repeatedly asking.

Honestly, I hate asking people to give me back money. I always feel guilty when I ask. I think that normally, at least in the western world, or at least in my country, people tried to give back the money they borrowed from others ASAP, however big or small. But my GF is buying fashion goods or food before giving me back the money. She always seems to forget, but she does it so often that I don't believe that's the case. Like, she says, ""oh I'll send you later"" and forget about it. If it was just a few bucks or few tens then I wouldn't care so much but normally these money are like over hundred bucks or so.

The thing that I'm most pissed about is the fact that she could always ask her parents and get money but she asks me because she's embarrassed and don't want to argue with her parents. She can do that if she wanted, but I can't call my parents for a few hundred bucks. If I had more money than her, I would've happily loaned money and waited until she felt like returning it, or even given the money. But I don't.

I'm kind of had enough. Because I'm constantly loaning her few hundred bucks, although I work a lot while studying part time, I can't really buy small treats for myself like new shoes or clothes. When she returns the money to me, because she doesn;t have her own money most of the time and her mom's credit card is her only source, she gives it back to me by taking me out to eat or things like that. Often not in the form of pure money. These things really don't help because I'm trying to save as much as I can to pay off the debt but because I give her the money, although she returns it eventually in some way, I end up using more than if I hadn't rent her the money. 

I've kind of had enough and want to break up because she needs a more rich boyfriend or change her ways, and I can't continue to have her in my life giving me unnecessary stress over money problems. I'm pretty set towards breaking up, but does my reasoning sound sound? If so then how do you think I should break up? I've never initiated a break up.",relationship_advice

t3_chmwpd,I [F22] feel violated by my boyfriend [M25],"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Tldr at the bottom. 
Also please excuse me for any grammatical mistakes. 

I have been having some health problems lately, which results in strong uterine pains.
This has put on hold my sexual relationship with my boyfriend, which I'm sure has his own hard time facing it, having a higher libido than me.

Also, I think my sexual desires have decreased since these health problems started. I feel very guilty about it, because I love my boyfriend and my heart wants to have sex with him, just my mind and body refuse to.
I haven't talked him about it because I'm afraid he wouldn't understand. He hasn't faced hormone imbalance (that's what I think it is, and I had to stop medication for it, but I digress) and I think he has a hard time understanding that sometimes, I'm not in the mood for sex. That's also my fault, because being the weak person that I am, I never fully voiced my dissent. 

However, this thing of ""not understanding"" when I don't feel like having sex (even saying things like ""let me go please"" and ""stop"") has took a very scary turn the other day.

We were at the beach. He was very excited about having sex later, while I was less interested. Anyway, he keeps being touchy, which I don't really mind. Then he keeps saying that he wants to fuck. He wants to fuck right there and now. And I don't want to. It was CLEAR that I didn't want to.

So we get on the sand, and while we was ""cuddling"" me, he starts fingering me. On the fucking beach. I'm like: ""stop please, people could see us and I don't like that"". But he continues. By now am feeling terrible and I couldn't even move or talk. I was frozen. I repeat: ""please stop"". He doesn't stop. Then he says something I wouldn't like to repeat, but was along the line of asserting dominance on me.

He finally stops, and I'm feeling very uneasy. I tell him I felt violated, and I didn't like it. So I move away from him.

He proceeded to say that ""he was sorry, but it's normal he wants to have sex with his girlfriend"". I tried to tell him how much that upset me, but tears kept coming up and I couldn't talk properly, so I just put my sunglasses on and pretended to sleep while I cried. I felt terrible. I felt like an object.

Why he couldn't control himself? It really puzzles me how he says he wants to make me feel good and he loves me but he can't understand why I don't like being fingered on the beach while everyone may spot us.

I tried to brush all of this thoughts away, and went on with my day. We even had sex later. But I can't seem to keep off my mind what happened. I feel that I have the right to feel violated, but maybe I should have voiced my dissent better, louder, or I should have talked before. I don't know what to think.

I feel treated like an object, with no real reason to exist but to please him. And I don't like it.
It also doesn't end here: he later talked how much he'd like to have anal with me. Now keep in mind: I don't like it, and it hurts. He fucking bought a plug so ""I could stretch for him so I'd like that"". What the fuck? 

Sorry for the long post, I vented a lot but I needed to put everything out. Please bear with me and let me know what I should do. Should I talk to him about it? I'm scared to do so because he may think I don't love him, or that I'm being moody... I don't know.

TLDR: My bf fingered me on a beach full of people despite me being against it. I didn't voice my dissent enough, still I can't help but feel like shit.",relationship_advice
t3_chmun7,"Figure out what happened, or continue to distract myself with meaningless dates?","This is a bit long, sorry in advance:
So I (25F) met this guy(22M), we’ll call him A, off of online... and wasn’t expecting great things, I was just doing it more for social exercise, BUT surprise to me I really thought it might be something *special*.
It felt different then any other guy I’d ever been with, and I felt so connected and comfortable with him almost immediately, when it usually takes me a very long time.
He put forth a lot more effort forth then i’m used to, and initiated some conversations early that implied he was looking for something serious.

We had 3 amazing dates, then when he asked about an ex of mine I basically told him about how I was a rebound unaware, and after four months of dating that man decided he was not ready for a real relationship and we had a messy uncomfortable break that left me in shambles. Because I didn’t have proper expectations of what was happening. It was good that it did not work out for several other reasons than that.

Then A goes on to tell me that he just got out of a relationship, and is not looking for relationship level commitment right now.

Which I was actually fine with, it was very early in dating and if that wasn’t where he was at it was okay.
I was more than willing to meet him where he was at, trying to make sure that he knew I was pressuring him, just that I liked him and would like to continue spending time with him for now.

I was glad that he had told me and felt like he could be honest with me, and he obviously did it in the pursuit of not wanting to hurt me.

He expressed interest in continuing to see me as well, so in my mind that meant going super slow, or just casually dating. No big deal right?

Well we had plans that weekend, and he ended up canceling with what sounded like a legitimate excuse, and immediately set something up in the next day. So I wasn’t worried.

Then when next day came, he canceled that date as well. And that excuse sounded more flaky, and he didn’t attempt to set anything up.

So I just told him no worries and to have a great night. Trying to put out a chill positive vibe for him.

That was 5 days ago. And I have not heard from him since.

So I’m just ...not sure what exactly happened. I’ve set up a couple dates with some other guys and I’m trying to stay busy to distract myself.

He didn’t unmatch with me or unfollow from me on social media, so I don’t know if that means he plans on hitting me up in the future?

I’m just so sad and feel like somethings been taken away that I didn’t even know I needed. I don’t know if I’ll find it again.
And I feel like we’ll really be missing something if don’t at least try.

I’m not sure if it’s worth trying to pursue him and ask him how he’s feeling about things, or if I should just continue to distract myself until I hopefully stop thinking about him.",relationship_advice
t3_chk4kv,I (20F) cut my narcissist/mentally ill mother off today 6 months before my wedding. Any support would help.,"I’m the eldest out of the 3 children- I have 2 younger sisters between 12-15.

She’s an “educated” and “upper class” Narc- so upon meeting her you’d just assume she’s this sweet 43 year old woman until her mask slips. If it wasn’t with my dad and their traumatizing fighting I was subjected to (which she basically forced him to marry her) it was with his sisters. If it is wasn’t with his sisters, it was with her mom. Her dad left long ago. Then, as we got older, it was always one of us.. **It was always someone.** I was molested throughout my childhood by a non-blood uncle, my father beat me for years (angry outbursts) as my mom sat and done nothing besides “well I told him to leave” and numerous other emotional wounds from her. I have since repaired through therapy the relationship with my father. She was never hit.

At 18 I thankfully scored a full scholarship, a kick ass job as a legal assistant with salary, hit the road- and didn’t look back. I kept in contact these past several years and my sisters have communicated she will never change.

Several days ago she got into (yet another) explosive fight with her mother and called me. She said if I don’t stop talking to my elderly grandmother (who’s done everything for my mom) that she will not be attending my wedding and how dare I talk to someone so hurtful to her as her daughter. She even went as far to say she’s going to lie to my father my husband beats me so he doesn’t fund our wedding. She lied to my younger sisters I said all these things I never did- under the impression I “didn’t side with her” by remaining neutral and they both now hate me and have blocked me. That was my last straw.

Today I changed my number, texted my mother to go fuck herself, enjoy her life, and she lost a good child now. Her response was “adios”. I was always her backbone, always the “best and warmest one” to her. This is going to be tough but I know I need to do this. I have my partner (28M) I been with for almost 3 years by my side and his family. This honestly feels worse than a death, at least there’s closure in that.",relationship_advice

t3_cho5km,My girlfriend just broke up with me.,"That's the thing. My gf broke up with me unexpectedly some days ago. Our last months were such a mess. We were both busy due to our final exams,so we didn't have contact. However,we could talk by whatsapp. Then she told me that this was over. She has told me that she can't deal with this anymore. I knew that it was not our best moment but I thought everything would be nice again. Now I find myself lost,I still can't belive what's happening. I begged her,I told her that I could do things better but she doesn't want to know anthing about me right now and I don't know what to do. She was my life.

t3_chmngp,A closeted gay friend (19M) confessed to my straight friend (19M) and now he’s confused about his sexuality because he’s open to dating him,"My straight friend doesn’t use Reddit so I got his permission to post here since he really wanted to see what y’all have to say. TL;DR at the bottom. 

So my straight male friend (short for SM) and his closeted gay friend (short for GM) both grew up in traditional Korean families where homosexuality was looked down upon. But then SM left Korea for America when he was 13, while GM was stuck in a traditional society and couldn’t come out of the closet. SM was exposed to the various sexual orientations while he was in America and became a lot more open- minded and accepting than his parents. They lost touch when SM went to America but then reconnected about 1.5 years ago and became really really good friends. Up until two day ago, SM had no clue that GM was gay. That was until GM confessed to him that he thought of SM more than just a friend. SM had always thought that he was straight (he’s dated girls before), but GM’s confession had made him question himself as to whether he was bi/gay because he was open to the idea of starting a relationship with GM. 

SM is now curious and is into trying to start  a relationship with GM, but he doesn’t want to take advantage of GM’s feelings if things don’t work out. SM is also going back to the US for uni and GM is staying in Korea so they’d be doing long distance. If SM were to reject GM, he knows he’d feel really guilty because they’ve pretty much been inseparable ever since SM came back to Korea and SM doesn’t want to loose a dear friend due to awkwardness. What do you guys think he should do? Is it just his teenage hormones acting up? Is it selfish of him for wanting to try it out knowing it might hurt GM?

TL;DR Closeted gay friend asked my oblivious straight male friend out, and straight friend is now questioning his sexuality as he’s open to starting a relationship with him, but then he doesn’t want to hurt him if it doesn’t work out and they have a fallout.",relationship_advice
t3_chkdm0,I (21 F) am not sure if I want to break up with my boyfriend (24 M) or not,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over three months, but we've known each other and been friends for three years since we met through a college club. On paper, he ticks about every single box I've ever had for my ""perfect man"" and we got along great when we were just friends. Recently, right before the most recent spring semester ended, he asked me to dinner and I had an amazing time. A few dates later, he asked me to be his girlfriend to which I gladly accepted. 

As I live in a different state than the college we both attend, I went home for the summer to help take care of my family's business, while he did not want a job over the summer break. In the beginning, everything seemed good and I don't remember many issues. Later, its been the same few issues popping up over and over with him claiming he's going to fix his behavior, it gets better for a bit, and then it goes right back to what it was before. 

We text almost constantly and call every few days as my work schedule allows. He normally asks about my day and then conversation devolves into one of three topics: his roommates and whatever they're doing, video games, or him asking me to do / not do something. He always gives small, concise responses to whatever I send even though I've mentioned it bothering me. Also, as he very much enjoys video games, he goes through random periods where he won't text or respond for hours because he gets too caught up in playing them with his friends. I expressed that this makes me worry something happened to him or me making a mistake, and he claims that he just forgot. I've been putting more hours into work as of late and as a result, am busy more often and more tired once I get home.  It's frustrating because he knows my work schedule (I send it to him once I get it) and yet he still forgets about his phone for hours on end to play more video games that he's been playing all day. 

It also feels like I've been putting more effort into conversations. I can send a text asking a question or his opinion or advice, and I get answers that are ten words or less. I also let him know that this bothers me because it feels like he isn't paying attention, to which he says he'll try more, but it ends up reverting before the end of the day. Whenever we call or FaceTime, I'm always very happy to talk to him and I actually feel happy and more confident in the relationship than I did at any other time. He has a very annoying habit of playing video games or being on social media when we talk, which I've asked him to stop, but it just keeps going back. 

He accidentally said ""I love you"" at the end of a call recently and I was faced with the reality that I'm really unsure if I can return the feelings or not. I've been confused lately as to whether or not I still like him and have been considering breaking up or at least doing our own thing temporarily over the summer until we can be closer together geographically again. I know if I break up with him it would absolutely destroy his emotions and that's what I would feel worst about, I hate making people unhappy. 

So my questions are should I break up with him or take a break even though he's most of the things I've ever wanted? Is it okay to feel ignored and like he isn't listening to me because of his behavior never really changing? Should I try and hang on until the summer ends (6 weeks) and just try and rekindle it then?",relationship_advice

t3_chmli8,How to build trust,"So I met this girl on Tinder 6 months ago and we started going out casually. At first things were not serious and we both were kind of seeing other people at the same time. After about a month I started being serious and committed to her and stopped seeing other people. Meanwhile she kept calling me her kinda boyfriend. 

The thing was, we knew she was moving back to Japan in a few months so we tried to stay casual, but eventually we both became quite serious. We had a discussion and we both said we were not having sex with other people. Things were great. We both had our own social life and an amazing relationship. 

Fast forward 3 more months, she moves back to Japan. Now we're long distance but we both love each other. I decided to look at Google photos and our memories and found out she had left hers signed in on my computer, and what I saw made me sick. 

A video of her best guy friend here at the end of the night with just them two drinking. As he's waiting for a cab, I can hear a kissing sound off the camera. Already pissed off, I scroll more down and find videos of them in his bedroom from a couple months ago, well after we agreed not to date other people.

I would normally just leave her right away, but what we had was very good and I love the girl. I really don't know what to do. Is there anyway I could trust her again? Or is this doomed?

t3_chkbx3,"Jealous without a good reason, don’t know what to do :(","Me (M23) and my girlfriend (F22) are just recently in an official relationship. We promised from the start that we would be very open/honest in communication with each other. 

So when we were still dating she told me about a good guy friend of hers. She told me about how he was in a relationship with this girl for 6 years, but they broke up. After the break up he had a lot of contact with my girlfriend (we were dating at that time), and even confessed that he was in love with her (my gf). He had really strong feelings for my gf, but she didn’t feel the same at all and told him that she was dating me. He accepted the situation, and they remained good friends. They still have contact with eachother, and they occasionally hangout.

And even tho she told me several times that she doesn’t have any type of feelings for him, and that there is nothing going on between them .. I still feel very jealous. To the point that when I see a notification of him on her phone, I really get into my feelings and it ruins my good mood. 

It really kills my vibe, and I can’t get it out of my head. Even when I’m not with her I think about him and her all the time. I know it’s not healthy but I don’t know what to do :( . It’s not that I don’t trust her, because generally speaking I’m not that jealous. But this situation in particular is really killing me mentally.

Also because I know that I don’t have any reason to be jealous.. she never gave me a red flag of unloyalty and she even says that I can read the text convo’s if I want. But every little thing makes me suspicious, and always at the end it shows that there was no reason for me to be so distrusting. And I don’t want to be that controlling guy and tell her that she can’t have any contact with him, especially when there is no good reason for it. 

I don’t want this to consume my mind anymore, and I also want to stop being so distant to her when I think about him, because she doesn’t do anything wrong.",relationship_advice
t3_chlr92,Not sure if in an abusive relationship,"So a bit of background I have been dating my boyfriend for 4 years.  I've studied donestic violence so I really should know better, but I really can't tell in this case. 

For the most part things are fine, we happily spend time together and share common interests.  He actually recently splurged on me for my birthday.  But the problem is the little things. 

For example, he is incapable of apologising to me if we have a fight.  When I say that he has upset me, the best I get is 'I'm sorry you feel that way'.  He also will not accept any responsibility for wrongdoing.  When I point it out he shuts down and will ask to not talk for a few days.  When I call him out on my feeling that I cannot share my issues with him, he won't talk about it and will sleep on the couch, as if to prove my point.  the last time I raised this he said it was because I had spent all day in the house and was obviously depressed.

I'm currently sick at the moment and he has said that I need to cook dinner for myself and made remarks when he thought I had left dishes for him to do.  If he's sick I wait on him hand and foot. 

He will bang on about how he loves me more, but won't sit down and talk to me.  I have caught him not listening to a word I have said on multiple occasions but he calls me a liar when I say that I had in fact told him something.  He's so worked up about that he know often 'file notes' our arguments. 

He's an incredibly smart man but I sometimes feel as though he holds that over me, despite the fact we have the same degrees and jobs.  He's also a golden child in his parents eyes, so I feel a lot of this may come down to how he has been raised. 

The thing also is, he doesn't exactly take no for an answer.  I mean, he will just grab me then expect sex or after he finishes once he expects me to keep going.  Because I've just had an injury I am often not in the mood and instead of respecting that he will touch hinself in front of me and even follow me around the house continuing to touch hinself, begging me to touch him, until I say yes.  I have broken down crying before because I don't feel respected, which is met with the 'I'm sorry you feel that way'. 

He also does not believe my injury is severe as it is and will sigh loudly when I say I can't do something. 

Despite all of the above, he can be very selfless and thoughtful.  We are often in a very happy place but when any of the above happen it makes me doubt my whole relationship.

t3_chnry0,Wife’s bad habits are ruining our relationship,"My [30/m] wife [25/f] and I have different standards for cleanliness. It’s something I can compromise with as long as she is willing to meet me halfway which  she isn’t. I am constantly cleaning after her along with normal household chores. I have to beg her to clean the kitchen and bathroom. Not only are our shared spaces a disaster, but even her stuff is gross. Her closet is messy and unorganized along with her vanity that has all of her makeup stuff. It drives me insane as I’m one of those people that needs to have a relatively clean home in order to relax. She won’t stick to any promises or agreements on cleaning schedules albeit I have never made an official, printed out schedule. It’s like pulling teeth to get her to clean because she always says she’s tired. She has a stressful job as an elementary school teacher, but I’m in school full time for the same thing and internships, PT job, and other commitments. Her only thing outside of work is playing on her phone and watching YouTube videos.  

To top all of this off, she has awful personal hygiene. She DOES brush her teeth everyday, thank god, but she doesn’t showers regularly. For example, her last shower was last Friday. On Saturday we attended an outdoor birthday party in which we sprayed ourselves with bug spray and sweated all day and night. I have tried hinting at her and being direct and telling her she smells and/or her hair is greasy. She just gets defensive and mad. Now I’m not one of those “you have to shower everyday” people. I myself only shower every other day because it’s not good for your skin and hair to wash everyday, but once a week? That’s too far.

This affecting everything! I never want to have sex because she smells. I don’t even want to sleep in the same bed. As for the cleaning, I feel like a maid or a parent cleaning after her or nagging her to clean. 

Help! What do I do that ISN’T leaving her? I know that’s an option but I feel there are many other steps before that. 

Also important to note that we are seeing a couples therapist and that thus far, it hasn’t affected her hygiene and cleaning.",relationship_advice

Me and my bf of two years recently decided to move in together. I really can see myself with him in the future,and we have such a great relationship. We never fight and our relationship has been growing so well. His work is not always permanant and in down time his company sometimes shifts him to other companies for work. Today he told me his company wants to send him away for work for a couple of days out of town next week, but one of the days is the day we're supposed to get our keys,do our walk through of our place, and start moving stuff in. He took the placement right away (in down time his company always tries to keep him with some sort of work so they really look out for him), but he told me he might not might it back in time to be with me and move in that day. Alternatively we decided to call our landlord to try and change days to the next day, which would still work fine for me and I think is a good compromise. However when he told me he wasn't sure if he could make it back for the day we had originally committed to,I couldn't help but feel upset. Im worried that how I feel means I'm not an understanding enough gf. I know he has to work (which is why I was okay with asking to move it to the next day) but I was upset the last minute change interfered with our plans.

Everytime im not out with my girlfriend it seems like she drink way more than she can handle.

When we are together she usually does not drink much or says outright she does not want to drink.

Several times i have received calls when shes out with her friends or messages showing she is really drunk (incoherent messages and calls).

Last week we laid down some rules since we were having fights about the same few subjects. Some of them included me not talking to a girl i slept with before and other things like if someone says they like us we cant keep talking to them.

I spoke to her today after she drank too much last night and felt like we should make a rule to control ourselves while drinking. I dont think we should get to the point of puking and blacking out as its very harmful not only to our health but someone could take advantage of her.

She pretty much said she felt like she should be able to drink as much as she wants.

Am i in the wrong for wanting us to put that rule?

t3_chqopa,I can't say anything,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Obs a throw away because while no one knows I'm on here, my user name is very recognizably my gamer tag.  Details will be slightly changed or made vague. It's a long one with quite a lot of background and it rambles a bit! Thanks in advance to anyone who makes it through!

First the background:

I (F31) have been with my boyfriend (M28) for nearly a decade. We got together in my home town, went through college together, started our careers together, and have just about gotten to a stable place in life together. We have good jobs, make decent money (him more), and a have home we inherited from a relative of his (Before people call me ungrateful, I feel extremely lucky to have there opportunity we did, I know most people don't get a free house). The problem is, I am nowhere near where I want be. 

I don't just mean geographically, though that is part of it. We now live in the middle of nowhere Montana, hours from my friends, and even more hours from my family. I have always been a city girl. To make matters worse I have a medical condition that makes going outside most days a challenge, if not potentially deadly. So outdoor activities really aren't my thing, to say the least. I have made some general acquaintances in the area, but these are very censored interactions. This is a highly conservative, very religious area with a high white supremacists population. (And before people freak, I'm not saying one has to do with the other, that's just how they are here.) I am very liberal, bi, and agnostic. I can't express my true opinions or self here safely. (Also, my job requires me to cultivate a certain amount of respect and to be an authority in my specialty, being myself would destroy my career here.) I know people will say there are like-minded people everywhere, but in a small town gossip is air.

The career itself isn't what I wanted either. I trained (college degree) to help people. I had to take the first job I could find here, and the industry I now work in is not known for helping it's fellow man. I know my behaviors are my choice, and I still personally work to help others, but it's a depressing environment. 

I am very unhappy. I know you make your own happiness and you choose to enjoy what you have, blah blah blah. But I am alone, with little to do, surrounded by people who would hate me if they knew who I was, in a unfulfilling job. I keep looking for other positions, but there are few openings here and a ton of competition for them. 

I know everyone is thinking, what about your boyfriend? This is why it's relationship advice.

The issue:

I can't talk to my boyfriend about difficult things. Long story short, we went though a very difficult and toxic point in our relationship several years back. We worked through most of those issues. The one still on the table is biggest one of all. I can't talk to him. When we would disagree, boyfriend's MO was to divert blame from himself. Usually at my expenses. He never took responsibility, twisted things to be my fault, and then made me feel bad about them. The stress of our relationship effected my metal health and in my disoriented state he managed to convince me it was all me. I now know that isn't true. I was certainly not blameless, but it was largely on him.  

For example: Bf and I were having a conversation when he got home from work one day. One he started about something he wanted to do. He was unloading, putting his lunch away, changing, and generally moving though the house.  I was following him, as we discussed a matter. He goes into the guest room to water his plants and shut the door right in my face! I'm was upset, but not raging. I found that very rude. I said that it bothered me and he went off on how I was bugging him right after work, how I was following him around, and how he just wanted some quite time. I pointed out it was his topic he has started and that if he had wanted some space I would have gladly given it to him. Eventually his defence was that he didn't realize I was right behind him. Which was an obvious lie.

It took a long time, but I've reached a point of clarity now. In the intervening years we have worked through many of those issues. He regrets his actions. He is trying to be better. But, I think the reason it is better now is that I just don't talk to him about things. Or rather can't. Some minor things I eventually talk myself into bringing up, ones I'm sure are fairly safe. Trying to bring something up usually end up with me having a mini anxiety attack and never getting the words out. When I do manage to talk about something, he no longer tries to blame me so much, but still never accepts blame himself. Or if he does, there are conditions attached that make it ""not really his fault."" I ended up feeling unheard and unsatisfied with the conversation, and try to end it as quickly as possible.

He knows I'm unhappy, to a certain extent. He knows I don't want to be here and why. We are saving to move closer to town. But in this time of isolation I'm beginning to realize how distant we have become. How little we have in common anymore. I could list so many things: He loves it here, this place is the life for him. He loves the outdoors. He wants to hunt (I hate hunting.) He spends his days outside maintaining the property. Most of what he talks about the property, it's care, the equipment he's fixing, etc. He doesn't game anymore. He doesn't share any of my intellectual pursuits such as history, philosophy, or physics. He's very religious. He wants children and I'm not so sure anymore (a whole second issues but it's roots are here). I haven't been able to discuss this part with him because this one will not go well.

I should point out that I'm not a timid person. I'm very confident and outspoken. It is only with him that I have this issue. 

I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to save up and split. Part of me feels like he deserves better. He really is a sweet guy who takes good care of me. He loves me very much. I don't know if talking will help this matter, even if I could. I really don't know what to do. It's possible I'm depressed and that's making my thinking more fatalistic. We have discussed therapy, but it's expensive, and it still involves talking. 

So question at the heart of it all is what do I do? Any advice at all! If I'm in the wrong somehow I want to know!",relationship_advice
t3_chqoga,My wife (26F) got pockmarked acne that's ravaged her skin,"I am a 34M with a good job with everything going for me other than a happy marriage. We have a beautiful 1 year old son together and have been married for 5 years. Six months after our wedding, my wife got terrible pockmarked acne all over her face that took a long time to go away. Initially she didn't take care of it right away and that bothered me. She would get hysterical as soon as I would mention it. Our marriage pretty much went downhill from there. Now almost 5 years later, the acne is gone but her entire face is pockmarked with ice pick and rolling acne scars. Based on my constant nagging and bickering, she started seeing a dermatologist a year ago who recommended profractal laser treatment to treat the scars. She has gotten 4 treatments so far, and while there has been some improvement in the scarring, without makeup it just looks really terrible.

I do love my wife and for the sake of our son I want us to continue this marriage. I don't want to leave her, she is not a horrible person, but I have been quite unhappy for a long time and I don't know what to do. Advice regarding next steps in the treatment would be appreciated, even though forcing her to see a dermatologist would cause a lot of fights and bickering.

I’m a computer engineering student in one of the top schools. She is smart and very attractive medical student. She is also very fit. I’m going to gym regularly and eat healthy so I’m also in good shape too. (Unnecessary background informations)

So we meet through a common friend and started getting close very fast. We have many things in common and we’re having great time together. Its been 3 months. I really liked her and thought that she was into me. However, when I said I really liked her, she said that she don’t want a relation because she likes freedom. Then, she also said that she don’t want to risk our friendship because she believe that every relation in these ages going to be over. Actually, I didn’t want a relationship too because I‘m going to study abroad next week(she knew that) for one semester and it would be very hard for both of us(recently decided to study two semesters). 
I never felt so close to someone else before. So, I said that we can continue being friends but my feelings will not change.

Yesterday, I learned from one of my friends that she was in holiday for a week with her ex. I knew that she was in holiday but she said that she will visit his friend and travel around. I heard that they broke up 8 months ago and they had been together for 4 years before that. She never mentioned about that either.

t3_chqo28,My(23F) long distance SO(30M) had a girlfriend for two years and I never knew,"This is an incredibly long story, and one that I have talked to death with my therapist and friends, and it isn't even exactly why I am here.

I am mostly here because this is a person who was in my life for 5 years, and I felt like I knew everything about him. And in a lot of ways I still do feel like I know him, but this is behavior that I never could have seen coming, but it does kind of make sense knowing his resistance to dealing with his emotional traumas. My biggest fear in relationships has always been a fear of being manipulated, and that is exactly what happened.

Is there ever a way to truly feel like you know someone, and know that they wouldn't cheat on you? I feel like I want to make sure that I have an SO who seems incredibly aware of their mental traumas and actively works to taking care of their mental health, and I feel like that is a good predictor for if I will be able to know who they really are. 

&amp;#x200B;

I let people in so easily, and from day one, you know exactly where I am at. I just want to find something like that, but it scares me that someone could be putting on a face even if they were acting that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have advice? Anyone who has been cheated on have advice for future relationships? How do you build back to a point where you feel like you can truly know someone again?

t3_chqlk3,Got rejected(sort of) after confessing to my crush and things between us are now really awkward. Advice?,"I'm gonna try to keep it short.

So I have a crush on a girl in my class (I'm in high school). So after 2 months of crushing on her, I gathered up my courage and decide to confess to her. She's really cute and innocent and not the type to have boyfriends (I live in a country where having premarital relationships are generally frowned upon). I was sure that she would not accept me (Again, she ain't that type). So I went and told her I liked her. She obviously didn't accept (She didn't explicitly say that she liked me but didn't hint the other way either. Anyways there was some chemistry between us.)She said that she's focusing on her studies and her ambition (which I really respect and found to be attractive). She was really nice. And we parted as friends. This was yesterday.

But today things got awkward. I mean really awkward. She seemed to avoid me. We have mutual friends and have group convos. We eat lunch in the same hall. She's in all my classes. She didn't seem to notice I was there(trust me people she noticed). And I sort of understand that but still she said that we could still be friends. So I went and asked her why she was avoiding me. She said that she wasn't avoiding me and I was avoiding her. I was never (maybe slightly) avoiding her though. I need some advice on this situation. I can't even talk to her without blushing deep red (she does the same thing). It's still really awkward.

Have some advice???

t3_chqkhl,Looking for advice on relationship with coworker.,"A summer intern (22F) started with the company this summer and her internship ends in a couple weeks. 

Over time I (24M) have found an interest in her and am unsure of what signs to look for if its mutual.

Things were pretty stagnant until a couple days ago when we carpooled to a company event together. We were in the car together for almost two hours laughing the entire time, getting to know each other.

When we got there she asked a seemingly suspicious question (if I added her on snapchat because someone with the same first name did and I'm the only one she knows with this name) but I didnt and told her so.. I asked her what her handle was and added her later that night so if that's what her intentions were then it worked. This was one of a few moments where I wondered what sort of interest she has in me.

On the car ride home (and there too) she asked many questions about my old boss (her current boss) and became extremely interested when I started talking about his marriage. The first question she asked within a split second of bringing it up was ""Is she hot?"". So at this point I'm beginning to think she has a thing for her boss. She mentioned how some guy at a conference this summer asked her for her number and asked her out, which she told her boss about. Without projecting too much I cant tell if this is a further indication that shes in to her boss or if she was trying to momentarily make me jealous.

Any one have thoughts of the queues she might be sending me? Should I bother asking her out once her internship is over or should I just assume shes being friendly? Not trying to make a fool of myself..

t3_chqk7r,I (20M) realized how much I miss an old friend (19F) and I don't know what to do,"1. My friend introduced me to a girl he was friends with back in 2017 when we had just finished our final exams in school. We were gonna be hanging out in my house afterward; he had been talking about her recently and I thought he might like her, so I told him to bring her too and she turned out to be pretty cool. Long-story short, he told me told me he had no interest in her after I said they sounded like an old-married couple.
2. She and I started talking, became good friends and a few months later I asked her if she wanted to come to my grads (this is similar to prom, but is more of a graduation celebration) as friends and she kind of avoided the question at first and said she needed time to think. A few days later, without prompt, she said she wanted to go. About 3 weeks before it, she cancelled on me without reason, and I'll admit I was a bit upset and half-ignored her for a while after that, but I got over it. I was kind of confused at this point in regard to how I felt about her.
3. A few months later, she invited me to a ball of sorts. It was really just another formal event except I'd be surrounded by people 3 times older than me. She was relentless, in a good way, in trying to get me to go. I figured I could just stick by her and my friend all night because he'd be there too and that's exactly what I did. When I was there, I was so hung up on  figuring out how I felt about her that I barely said a word to anyone and on top of that the food and drink were so bad that my friend and I were starting to feel under the weather. She had repeatedly been asked to dance by multiple people but kept refusing and I got the message that she was waiting for me to ask her, but I didn't.
4. My friend's mom came to pick us up because I was gonna be sleeping at his for the night, and as I was leaving I heard that she cut her leg pretty badly. I wanted to go to her and make sure she was alright, but I felt bad for my friend already because I felt like I had ruined his night and I didn't want to keep his mom waiting...so I left without saying goodbye. That's the stupidest thing I could've done.
5. After that night I figured she probably really liked me and I knew I screwed up and she probably didn't like me anymore, so I didn't even bother trying to fix things. It was at this point I knew I wanted to be with her. We drifted apart after being good friends for just under a year, and I fooled myself into thinking I never liked her that much, even as a friend.
6. We haven't talked in over a year and I've changed so much since then; gained more confidence and have become much less introverted. I'm not sure whether to say it's fortunate or otherwise, but I had a dream recently where we reconnected and both came to the realization that we missed each other so much. Once I woke up I had this intense feeling that I missed her. I waited about a week to see if it was some freak thing and if the feelings would subside, but they haven't.

&amp;#x200B;

  
I'm not sure what I want beyond wanting to be in her life again, but regardless, I have absolutely no idea how to reconnect with her or where to even start.

t3_chlitf,"What to do after letting someone you thought you could trust into your home? Manipulative (Long story, I apologize in advance)","At a loss for words... This is going to be a long winded story, yet summed up best I can because this has been going on for a year now.

I made a huge mistake. Let someone that I thought was family into my home, and now I’m paying the price. I allowed her to move in with me and my grandmother. I first met her in a student club where high schoolers were able to help out and develop relationships with special needs kids and their teachers. She was an aide. We became friends very quickly, connected on all aspects in life. I viewed her as a mentor and someone that could really help me and vice versa. I made a fetal error of thinking I knew someone, &amp; inviting her into my home. She has a son who is very young that she uses for sympathy of others and is completely innocent in his mother’s actions. (if you saw how they made their rounds to loved ones and friends on holidays you’d understand) I am at a complete loss as to what to do. At the age of 17, I was struggling to keep a steady job due to harassment in the work place (Have high functioning autism) and she was able to take advantage of my family’s disfunction to basically secure her a place in the house. This woman convinced my grandmother that I wasn’t an asset to the house, and that I was ungrateful, etc. I was truly too depressed to even leave my room and I was also faulted for that. In my mind, I didn’t want to bring depressive energy around my grandma. Now, she has two of her friends moving into the house. I’ve long moved out by now. I couldn’t take the constant ridicule and criticism as Ive been trying to figure out what I wanted in life and have been finding myself. To give a little backstory on my family and why this person was able to take advantage of the conflict- My grandma raised me. Mom was very caught up in her ever changing life and everyone had come to an agreement that living with my grandparents would be best. And it was. My grandpa got sick and became bedridden when I was very young. So my grandma was basically like a single parent. I knew nothing of my family’s past until the past few years and things I’ve found out have been heartbreaking, because ideally, all I’ve ever wanted is for us all to be together but I understand that will never be the case. My grandma and mother aren’t close due things they’ve happened in the past- I.e. my grandma cheating on my grandfather and tearing the family apart because of it, she is also a pathological liar. because my grandfather had to go through such great lengths of bailing her out of prison due to her work scandals, my mother is scarred. I have taken in everyone’s perspectives and tried to see a clear picture of things and it is tearing me up. 


I remember this woman telling me in the past that she was jealous of my life but I was so disassociated from reality and in survival mode that I wasn’t able to protect myself. I didn’t think she would go through such great lengths to pretend to care for me as a person just to essentially “take” my spot. Well I’ve given up. I moved out a month ago away from the toxicity. I have tried being a part of their lives but feel as if I no longer fit into a place I used to call home. I was made to be very dependent from a young age and was torn apart when I couldn’t be self sufficient and when it became inconvenient for my grandma. Now my mother and I have reconnected after a long time, and she is helping me get my life together.

What has broken the straw for me, is the fact that my grandma, and her roommate, tried setting me up with one of her friends. My grandma kept calling me and telling me that I need to meet him and how him and I are so much alike and how I would love him. Well, I met him. &amp; I fell very fast. We spent hours connecting and talking about life. Made art together. What I didn’t know, was that he had a thing for my roommate since day one even though she’s in a relationship, she is playing both sides. I’m so embarrassed that I admit my feelings to this person only to find out they had been a discreet thing all along. I can’t help but feel like it was all a set up and intentional. Him and I meeting was almost forced instead of happening natural. They made it extremely awkward.. if I wasn’t so young and inexperienced, things would be different. If I had my life together more, I never would have allowed someone to take so much advantage. 

At the end of the day, my mother and I both deeply worry about my grandma who is very sick and most likely not thinking very clearly, because she has invited a bunch of strangers into her house who are using her. Another example, when I was in between jobs, the woman I’m speaking of mentioned that my grandma was paying her for her foodstamps.. and expressed that was her way of contributing to the house. My grandma is currently trying to clear up another room for them to use, and I found out she has an ant infestation she is holding off on treating due to lack of funds— no one there has offered to help or pay for anything and they’re all staying for free. If I had a job, I would provide the money in a heartbeat. Circumstance is not in my favor but I’m going to have a degree later down the road and want to take care of my entire family when I can... I just don’t understand how people can be so hateful.

I have tried telling my grandma that this person doesn’t have our best interest and doesn’t seem to care, but she won’t hear me out. She has her own opinions and constantly tells me that I’m perceiving things wrong. I have been so open to try and understand other perspectives that I forgot about myself and that’s why I had to move in the first place. I have already typed so much and that is only a fraction of the story but I have shared what has hurt me the most. If anyone has any insight or advice on what to do, please PM me or leave a comment.

t3_chqk09,My (23F) mother (53F) is very controlling over me.,"Small context, my mom and I have a... very strained relationship. Shes always ragging on me for my weight and I am very self conscious of myself anyway. Thanks to her I have no faith in myself and have to wear baggy clothes to hide my body. I wear nerdy shirts based of video games and anime. Pretty much all I own besides my work uniform.

All while she keeps telling me I need to take pride in how I dress and look. She doesn't like it when I wear make up or wear dresses and skirts. 

Followed by how I can never go out and hang with my friends at night and literally all we do is hangout at someone's house and play board games and video games. Half the time my boyfriend can't go because of when he works. If its past a certain time at night, nope I can't go. Which has resulted on my group of friends not really inviting to much of anything anymore. 

And yes I am aware I'm an adult but I also like to show my mom some respect. Her house her rules. Also I work a dead end job with bills to pay so I'm trying to save money to move out, trust me. 

I have an older brother (27M) who got to leave the house whenever at night and come back whenever the next day. He has multiple girlfriends where my mom has known he was sexually active with and even recently got one pregnant. And even had a few girlfriends live with us. I cant even stay the night at my boyfriend's or have him stay the night at my place.

While I have awful periods, decided to put myself on the pills to help and she freaked out. Also I am sexually active but only one family member knows. My mom would kill me if she knew. She always says ""Sex is for marriage."" which I know good and well she and my dad had sex well before marriage since they're high school sweethearts.

But she has never approved of any of the guys I've dated and I've only dated barely 4 guys. And the guy I'm with now, I'm very much in love with and he's going to school to be an EMT. 

I'm just so tired of her controlling me... I have my grandmas I could stay at but my brother is living with her. He and I don't get along well for many other reasons. I'm kinda trapped till I can get to my goal for moving out.",relationship_advice

t3_chqjjk,Dating advice,"Hi reddit.
So I've been seeing this guy for a month roughly now and one night we both confessed that we have some sort of crush on each other but wanted things to be slow, which came from both sides since we have both been in toxic relationships before.

Hes a super honest and direct person.

A few days ago he's just been more distant. Also hes been online way more and I just started thinking ""ok he found someone better than me and I'm just not interesting enough anymore"". I never confronted him about it, because it seems kind of overreacting and I'm trying to get better at trusting people.
But I told my beat friend and she basically said that I should get down to earth because essentially we are just 2 people who have sex and hang out and that's it. 

I get what she meant because I am usually always like nobody owes anybody anything. And I mean he can do what he wants and I can do what I want essentially.
But somehow that still hurt me in some kind of way. We also talked about what if we wanna date other people and agreed that we should at least be honest about it and communicate but that theres nothing wrong with it.
Which it isnt and idk why but I'm just feeling so bad over this. 
I dont wanna take anybody's opportunity and I also dont wanna be like ""we need to label this now"" because hasn't played out well in the past and I also dont wanna label things.

Idk this is a lot of text now, sorry.

Basically I feel hurt even tho i got no reason at all and idk what to do, like my coping mechanisms are telling me to distance myself so IF he ends up falling for somebody else I won't be that hurt.
I do wanna keep talking to him but yeah my brain is telling me to shut down.

t3_chqidb,Advice on sexual rejection (21f),"Longtime lurker. I (f21) and bf (m30) have been together 1 year and are having a sexual compatibility problem. After a day together I understand we both want to chill, cuddle, chat and probably neither of us will be horny. Even without feeling horny I feel like I want to be close to my s.o and intimate. He thinks that sex takes away from the two of us just enjoying each others company. I think it is an expression of our love and it makes me feel close to him. He has been saying no also because he's tired on weekdays after working.

For the last few months it's been me trying it on with him and then being rejected. Being rejected multiple times just hurts. This week he said it's unfair for me to pressure him. I can understand he may feel disrespected as no should mean no - no further discussion. And I get that. But he's tired every weekday and 50/50 on the weekend. I feel we should make the time and effort to be intimate together. We've suggested doing it earlier in the evening. But at this point now I feel like I don't want to initiate anymore, after being rejected and feeling unattractive, I feel vulnerable and I refuse to push something he doesn't want. I think he won't come onto me so sex will decrease. 

After talking about it this week he sent me a text picture saying ""I say no sometimes, that doesn't mean I'm a bad person though it feels that way somehow and it doesn't mean I don't care"". This made me feel like I'm an aggressor and made me feel bad about myself.

I've always been close to my oldest cousin (34 F), she's babysat me when I was younger, I've confided in her as I grew up, she's taken me for vacations trips with her bf, etc etc.

When she got pregnant with ""niece"" (not directly niece since she isn't the daughter of a sibling, even thought I consider my cousin to be one), she was obviously nervous for being young, but I was mostly happy. We are currently living in the same city, about 600km away from our relatives.

I've taken care of my niece since I can remember, from diaper changes to just babysitting once we grew older. She's obviously always been close to me, and as I got my own apartment couple of years ago she usually comes by to stay every other weekend for a night or two, we go out to eat, to the movies, etc. 

So last friday evening, my cousin's bf dropped her off at my place (we had already agreed to, I like having her around), we just ordered some food and watched some movies, nothing out of the ordinary.

On saturday, took her shopping, I had to buy a pair of shoes for my job, and I bought her a sweater and a pair of jeans that she liked. We got home, I made lunch then we just went to my bedroom and started watching some netflix show (Stranger things, idk why I tell you that). She was laying on my chest while we were just idly talking/watching tv, then suddently she turned to face me properly, grabbed my head and just kissed me on the lips. I was stunned for a second, but then I just pulled back and got out of the bed. She started getting teary eyed and I basically just put some clothes on and left. Called my cousin to ask her to pick her up, giving some excuse about having to leave for work.

Currently I make roughly $37/h, and handle all bills for everything.

She came back and we talked about it and wanted to try and make a way forward from it I asked if anything happened and she said no I believed her. Today I got a message off a guy that at the start of our relationship kept trying to get fired in about her on one occasion kissing her which she denied and later confessed to, guy was someone she had hooked up with in her past but she told me it was nothing serious. The guy was bragging to me about how they slept together and did I want to pick up her things showing me a picture of a bracelet I had gave her. I confronted her and she admitted to it. She told me she was broken at the thought of loosing me that she thought it was done for good and she went to the first place she got attention because she needed a distraction. She insisted that she regretted it the next day and felt ashamed and knew she only wanted me. For a final kick in the balls is  I found out it she went to his the same night we split up. 

I think understandably I’m hurt and angry at the situation. I know I will be told I did end it so I can’t really hold it against her but to me the limited time she waited and the choice of person kinda shows to me a total lack of care and respect for me.

t3_chqdo7,My [M23] girlfriend [F21] broke up with me over my dietary choices,"So this girl, let's call her Beatrice, and I had been dating for about two months now. I'll have to give you a little backstory, but she just abruptly ended our relationship yesterday.

Since I was a child, I've had admittedly a bit of an odd snack choice. I love eating spider webs. I tried a spider web when I was around 8 and I've been hooked since. As a kid, when I was playing outside and I found a spider web, I would put my hand on the web and roll it around to get all the web and spider on my hand and then I would eat it. I just love the flavor of the web and sometimes there's even bugs or a spider in the web, so you get those little bits of crunch to go along with the silky smooth web.  As I've gotten older, I'm outside around spider webs less, so what I do now is go somewhere like a crawl space where there's lots of spider webs and gather as much web as possible and put in a resealable Ziplock bag for future snacking.

Anyway, back to the present.  I was at Beatrice's apartment, we were about to go out to see Midsommar. She went into her room to change and I realized I had a hankering for a snack, but I didn't want to pay movie theater prices for candy or popcorn. I reached into my tote bag and pulled out my zip lock bag of spider webs. I reached in and starting chowing down, and then Beatrice came out of her room. She asked me what I was eating and I told her spider webs. She started laughing because she thought I was joking, but then she came closer and saw that I was actually eating spider webs. She gave me a look of disgust and started freaking out. She asked me to leave and tried to protest, but she started yelling and telling me to leave immediately.

I tried texting her when I got home, but she's not responding and she blocked me on all social media. What should I do? It seems very petty of her to throw what we had away over a simple dietary difference, so maybe I don't want to be with someone like her, but at the same time we had a great thing going and I want to see it there's anyway to reconcile.",relationship_advice

Is there anyone who has had a bad or a particular good experience when they saw their so in such a state? I just need some piece of mind.",relationship_advice
t3_chqcjt,"I love my wife, she loves lying.","Me, (M33) have been suspecting my wife  (F34) of cheating since October.  I have monitored her phone Snapchat and instagram and noticed constant interaction with a guy that lives out of state.  (Where she is from originally).  She insisted they have always been friends.  She never mentioned him in the 6 years we have been together.  I told her I don’t like her talking with him.  She deleted him, then I noticed she added him under a different name.  She went back home and I tracked her phone.  I noticed she went to his house one night.  When I confronted her she lied about where she was.  Eventually she admitted to going over there.  She said it was to end it and tell him they couldn’t talk anymore because small talk can hurt feelings.  (Also when she got back I noticed she took a pregnancy test.).  We always have sex  with no BC, but she hasn’t taken a test in over a year.  I don’t trust her anymore or believe her in the slightest.  I want to stay with her but can’t get over the betrayal.  Would any women go to a house for 30-40 minutes to end it or is that a prime affair hook up time?

tl;dr : wife lies about how much she talks to guy and sees him.  Any way it’s innocent friendship?",relationship_advice
t3_chqcap,Would you go after a man with girlfriend?,"Say they are in a 3 year relationship(both early30s) not living together and a guy is heavily pursuing you. Apart from the part that he is willing to cheat on her if you agree would you consider getting to know him. Does it matter that they’re not married or engaged?

Please no comments about the cheating part. My question is when you like a guy with a gf and he likes you back do you still consider him unavailable even he is not engaged or being in a relationship already means he is committed?

My brothers recent suicide initially brought us together. This lasted for a few weeks and old patterns returned so I walked away.

I understand I play a part in this. I’m not one to assume it’s everyone else’s fault.

t3_chqc4d,"Girl (27F) I'm (28M) talking to, is blowing up a situation, and believing her 'friend' over me","Girl = Woman I've been talking to, and having issues with.

Friend = Girls friend who I've known longer than Girl.

Someone = Person friend wanted to hook me up with.

Quick backstory:

We had met over instagram September 2018, she is married but separated, and she has kids. She separated due to domestic violence and abuse throughout their 8 year marriage. We got extremely close to eachother, initially as friends but grew into something more intimate. We said we loved eachother in May 2019, and grew closer past that. However, she's not healthy and she knows that. She knows she has alot of healing to go through. And she has made selfish decisions such as sleeping with someone else after we started talking, sexting another married man. Stuff like that, but I've understood because of where she's at right now mentally. Her current husband is going to trial for the domestic violence against her and will probably face jail time, atleast a year. And since she's a domestic abuse victim, she is still hanging on him. She is not attracted to him, and doesn't want him, but she is still attached. And she's agreed about how much pain, hurt and anxiety she's put me through by her uncertainty of everything. Such as her wanting me one day, but the next being completely distant.

So let's fast forward here...

3 weeks ago, I've wanted to sit down and talk to her about our situation, how she's feeling, where she wants to go with our relationship etc. because she had been distant and it's been a while since we've had a deep meaningful talk, and she had mentioned wanting to take a break, I had also gotten word that she was thinking of completely going back to her husband and not getting the divorce. She kept putting it off, promising me that she wanted to talk. But her husband was either around, she was too tired, had to take care of the kids etc etc. There was always an excuse, and I understood that. She's practically a single mom working full time, it's hard to make time. Well I would ask her about it alot, saying, ""Hey if you can make time this week for us to talk, I would really appreciate it"". And it never went anywhere. So last week, let's say the 15th, I started really cracking down because I had seen multiple times where we could have sat down and talked, but she chose not to. So on Wednesday, I told her that if we couldn't sit down and talk that I was done, we could be friends, but I couldn't go on allowing my self to get hurt. After that she sent me alot of texts explaining how she knows I deserve better, she knows that she can be an amazing woman for me but right now she's not healthy, she wants me to be happy etc etc. Well, we have a microbrewery taproom where I live, I frequent it, and I know the people who go there, such as her friend I mentioned in the title. I went on Thursday the 18th to play trivia to get my mind off of things and I was sitting at the table with her friend, the girl I'm talking to wasn't there. Her friend knows the struggle that this girl has put me through, and decides that she wants to hook me up with someone else who apparently was really into me. So to recap I had told the girl that I'm done, and her friend decided to hook me up with someone else. Well I added this someone else on snapchat later that night, and we started casually talking the next day, which would be Friday. Friday also happened to be the girl I'm talking to's Birthday. She decided she wanted to see me, so I went by her house and it was the perfect time to finally talk to her about everything, what we're doing, where we're going in a relationship etc. She got upset that I wanted to talk and said: I don't want to talk about this, if you want to talk go make other plans. So I did, I was upset yet again that she couldn't sit down and have an honest conversation with me, feeling rejected and empowering my decision earlier in the week that I was done with her. So I go to the taproom after I leave her house, her friend shows up and we all sit together with other people, and she decided to invite the someone who she wanted to hook me up with and that I've been talking to casually on snapchat.  I was there for an hour before this someone else shows up, and wouldn't you know it about 15mins later the Girl I'm talking to shows up. Girl ends up leaving, not knowing that Someone is there, she didn't even know who Someone was. Girl just saw me there, got upset that I had actually left her house after she told me to find something else to do, and I went to taproom. Girls sister started texting me begging me to spend the rest of the night with them for Girls birthday, I finally agreed, setting my own emotions aside so Girl can have a good night for her Birthday. I hang out with them the rest of the night Friday. Sunday rolls around, and I get the nerve again to ask her, one last time, if she wants to talk. And we get into an argument and I'm letting it all out on her, of how I feel rejected, hurt etc etc, and all I've been wanting to do is talk through everything with her about where we are, so we have a clear understanding. Finally she agrees to talk Monday night. Halfway through she asked if I was talking to anyone else, she had intuition that I was talking to someone, SO I admit to her that I met this someone on Thursday night and we've been talking casually. We had a great talk, very constructive, we worked things out, understood eachothers side of things, and it made me feel so much ease towards me and Girl. I stayed the night actually, that's how good the conversation was. So we fast forward to yesterday, Wednesday. I get a random text in the morning from Girl telling me I lied. Girls Friend had decided she was going to tell Girl that I was saying me and Girl didn't talk anymore, and that me and Girl were not a thing, that I had said bad things, and manipulated friend and that's why friend wanted to hook me up with someone. After Monday btw, I stopped talking to someone, I wasn't interested in her, not only because I still wanted Girl, but because I wasn't into someone. So now Girl thinks I'm lying about that, she thinks I purposefully left to go hang out with Someone, and now she thinks I told friend a very deep secret a long time ago that I didn't tell her. But she's believing friend over me. And At this point I'm trying to figure out what to do, what to say to her, how to prove my innocence to her. Is this a lost cause? Is she too broken and afraid that she wants to ruin what we could potentially have? I just need unbiased help, any help.",relationship_advice
t3_chqc2o,Girlfriend (F21) suddenly doesn’t feel the same,"I've been this girl for 6 months. She has high anxiety and has her moments mentally from time to time. I am currently on a family vacation with her right now, and suddenly she was giving me the cold shoulder. Nothing I said was funny, never sparking conversation, never being intimate, no sex. So asked her what was wrong and she told me a few things:

- She gets very upset when I make jokes around her that touch her sensitivities (e.g. weight jokes, weed jokes, etc)
- She says I never text her first
- She says I never show her off on social media or like taking pictures with her
- She says since school she has barely felt like she's had a boyfriend

She dumped all of this on me. I was caring and understanding. I apologized for the jokes I had offended her with and can do more of the other things she mentioned easily. But I also told her, I cannot have a girlfriend who isn't loving, affectionate and easy to talk to, like she was a mere few weeks ago! She also said that she doesn't know if she can have us go back to the way we were. We made up that night, she said she loved me, and that she would love to try to make this work.

But now, everything seems fake. Some affection but not like before, we were all over each other. I don't think it is fair that she thinks I was supposed to read her mind and figure out this stuff on my own! And these are such minor things. But we are still not hooking up (she is on her period). She called her mom last night and she told her that she's in the wrong and that her lack of communication caused this. I have been nothing but a strong and caring boyfriend to her. My lack of texting or posting her on social media is on the smallest side of the spectrum but it appears to be ruining everything. I understand its only been a few days since this talk, but how can she expect to have a long term relationship without understanding communication and the highs and lows ?!

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Best.

t3_chldr3,Has porn made me into the ultimate cuck? I struggle to see myself as a sexual being...,"I (21M) grew up really sheltered and socially anxious. Add that to the fact that I was ugly up until age 19, I had a really hard time. Low self esteem, anxiety, depression...

I used porn as an escape. I was addicted. I used to wank upwards to 5 times in one day. It started ok then turned into fucked up fetishes. 

**I never saw sex as something that I could actually participate in. I just never considered it a possibility.**

*Me?* No way. This is how I thought. So I abused a lot of porn. It (sex) just seemed like something *other* people did but not me.

Eventually at age 19 I lost weight and looked good. However there was still a disconnect in getting attention from girls. Sex was something I only thought *other* people do, not me. I tried a few Nofap streaks but could only do several days at a time.

On my longest streak I went 3 weeks and then fucked a prostitute. But this felt like glorified porn. I was no longer a virgin but the experience didn't feel natural. How could it? I paid for sex. There was no mutual attraction or build up.

I always cock blocked myself when girls wanted to fuck me from nightclubs. The thought terrified me...but after fucking the prostitute I realized I had no performance issues. 

Now I'm on a 12 day Nofap streak. The problem is, I can talk to girls, socialise, etc but there seems to be a disconnect in believing that *I* could be the guy to have sex with them, even though these girls have shown interest in me. **I'm so used to watching other people live their lives, that I never really learned how to live my own.**

t3_chqabs,Should I stay with him?,"Today I found out that my boyfriend kissed a female friend on a night out. To give context we've been going out for around 3 months but have been close friends for about a year. In all other aspects he has been a perfect boyfriend which is a welcome change from previous relationships. I've had kind of emotionally abusive and manipulative relationships that's he's aware of and has helped me gain confidence in being in a relationship again as I had not wanted to be in one ever again. He's been very supportive and understanding and has treated me better than anyone has ever done before.
Now to explain the kiss. He had just graduated uni and was absolutely wasted and he said a female friend kissed him at the end of a night out outside a takeaway. He said it lasted about a second and was just more than a peck. The girl is the type of girl who likes to kiss other girls bf and I feel like she kissed him because she wanted to see if she could. Which apparently she could. He apparently didn't say anything to her afterwards and when I asked him to message her to say that it was a mistake he said that it would be very awkward and that she probably doesn't remember doing it.
I really like this guy, more so than anyone I've ever been with but I have had very bad luck with guys mainly due to my own lack of strength and letting myself be badly treated. I don't want to throw away a potentially good relationship over a kiss that he didn't initiate and that lasted a second but I also don't want to be a push over. I've essentially been cheated on which has never happened before and really don't know what to do.
He's said sorry a lot and that it was just a very drunken mistake and that it won't happen again but I don't want to be the type of person that stays with someone once they've been cheated on. I don't know if it was a meaningless kiss or something worse and I feel like it's very early in the relationship for something like this to happen.

t3_chb9l5,I now have the clear memory of my boyfriend raping me,"I had a suppressed memory of my boyfriend raping me. I had blurry memories of it before but I wasn’t ever sure so I really didn’t know what I was thinking.

But last night I  (f, 23) was having sex with my boyfriend (m, 26) and all of a sudden it just came back to me all at once. I don’t want to give the gory details but 

It was like a flashback and a terrible feeling rushed over me like it was happening then.

I guess I reacted because my boyfriend kept saying my name and then he slapped me across the face and said “what’s wrong with you”

the slap kinda put me back in reality and I felt so weird and sick, I told him nothing and let him finish.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m going crazy or not. I’m also mad that my boyfriend slapped me but whatever I’m more hung up on the other thing.

t3_ch9msc,From 15-18 I was in a relationship with a person 10 years my senior. Was this abuse?,"I’m not really sure where else to post this. 

Long story short, I got involved with a man when I was 15. He would give me light but inappropriate touches and then a little before my 16th (age of consent here) it escalated to kissing and then eventually when I was 17, oral sex. 

Obviously, I think he’s seriously fucked up to have been involved with me. However, there were a few points I wanted to mention that lead to me being so unsure about..how I should view it, I guess. 

• I was very, very into it. I consistently fed into his feelings and encouraged him to continue with me. 

• We did argue at times and when I would call him a pedophile/etc he would say “You were the age of consent so nothing illegal happened” and imply that being the age of consent equals being an adult. 

• However, we never had sex and he was pretty serious about waiting (although he did try on one occasion and I firmly said no)  

• I would usually say no to giving or receiving oral sex too and he would always pull it out and start begging/pouting and touching me. 

• He was extremely possessive but I was too so I’m unsure what to think there. Being around the opposite sex was always a problem. 

• We had no physical contact something like 6 months before I turned 18 and I broke up with him soon after because I couldn’t get past my feelings (for months I couldn’t stop thinking about how messed up he must be)

Despite all of this, I truly believe he’s a good person at heart and I’m not trying to ruin his life. It’s been years now and I’ve moved on, but I just need someone from the outside looking in to tell me if, besides really perverted, he was also abusing me sexually or any other way?

Edit: a lot of responses are somewhat focused on the legal aspect of the relationship. I really don’t care what was illegal or legal, I’m not trying to make a case. Just trying to process a part of my life I’ve been blocking out.

Edit 2: I was just reminded by someone that sent me a PM that a few months after we broke up a conversation about child abuse was brought up while we were in the same circle. He pulled me to the side afterward and asked if he had ever hurt me. I asked what he meant in asking that, but he never elaborated.

I always knew especially now that she’s older, that my daughter had issues. 

My husband doesn’t believe in any of this. And I feel like it’s my fault for always downplaying my own, and never going to treatment for it. But I know how my daughter feels and my husband is giving her a really hard time.

He tells me “she’s not crazy she just needs to be disciplined”.

I’ve always been very protective of her from him even before I knew because I felt like I knew how to help her not him.

All my kids love him but he can be very intimidating. He yells a lot. And I know she can be scared of him. And it doesn’t help when you’re manic or depressed. 

My husband won’t speak to her psychologist and is telling me to pull her out of therapy and do not put her on meds, or he will do it himself.

My SO for example, will not even ask me about my day (or may just ask 'wyd') and then instantly go on about how bad things are at work and life and these paragraphs after paragraphs of drama.

After some bad relationships, I realized that I have some unsolved issues, which might go way back in my childhood.

However, I stoped using Tinder or any other means of finding a date, stopped flirting and everything as I think I want to understand myself first.

t3_chq594,How should I handle my shitty roommate and her annoying/disgusting/inconsiderate actions?,"It’s long, lots of detail, I’d like some advice. TLDR at the bottom

Hi, so I’ve posted quite a bit on reddit asking for advice on how to deal with my roomate. Nothings really been working and that’s partially been my fault due to poor communication skills. I’ve already decided that I’m moving out October 1st when the lease it up, but I’d like some advice on how to not be completely miserable for the next 2 months and maybe not burn down the bridge with her after I leave. 

Some background: 
I’ve (20F) been living with my step sister (18F), who I didn’t grow up with, since April. I’ll refer to her as S. I was already living with another roommate but her mom was moving out of state and S asked me if I wanted to get an apartment with her. I agreed even after she said her boyfriend, A, would be moving in to. They had been dating for like 2 years and I met him a few times and he seemed cool. Week one I discovered that S had been sleeping with 2 other guys at our apartment while A was at work. I kept that secret for her a month until A came home early and found S in the bedroom with some other dude. a beat the fuck out of the  dude and I thought he would move out and that’d be it. That unfortunately was not it. The next day I go to pay rent and A wants to go with me, I’m like “oh fuck”, and we’re driving there and he asked me what’s been going on. Apparently S convinced A that the dude was just a friend and A needed to hear that from me I guess. I told him the truth because I felt so bad and honestly thought he deserved better. They break up, he moves out, and S says she can’t afford the master bedroom and wants to switch with me. So now I’m paying more rent than I wanted to. The inconsistency is just beginning. 

After A left I learned that me and him did the majority of the cleaning because HOLY FUCK did our apartment just suddenly get way dirtier. She would throw acid and moly parties and not clean up the garbage and mess for 2 days. She leaves dishes in the sink even though we agreed to put them in the dishwasher. She wont scrub the dishes and just let the food get stuck on and wonders why nothings clean. She honestly hasn’t taken out the fucking garbage once since we moved here even though her parking spot is the closest spot to the dumpster. She has the guest bathroom and it’s too embarrassing to let people use it that I just let them use the one in the master because I keep it clean. She has the grosses room I’ve ever seen, I don’t really care too much about this as it’s her own personal space, but if I clean the house within a day the common areas look just like her room. She never vacuums. She smokes a pack a day and hasn’t thrown away any cigarettes from the patio so there all just sitting there. I don’t go on the patio, even tho I’d like to, because she’s turned out there into her storage area. There’s all her boxes and a bag of stuffed animals that’s she didn’t want to throw away. This stuff irritates me to no end and I’ve talked to her about her mess numerous times. All she told me was that she’s a “kid” and “doesn’t know any better”. I told her that she’s a fucking adult not a kid and needs to act like it. Part of being an adult is cleaning up after yourself so your roommate doesn’t have to. 

For a solid month there was either a new tinder dude or like 5 of her friends in our apartment. She wouldn’t give me a heads up sometimes and I’d come home and want to relax and I can’t. One of these friends was my old roommates gf who I very much disliked for many reasons and expressed this disliking for to S asking her not to invite her for,but she decided that she was “in love” with this girl and they started “dating”
for like 2 weeks. This girl eventually got evicted and banned from our entire apartment complex because she tripped the fuck up on acid and banged on 3 of our neighbors doors at 2am telling them to get out of “her house”. Fun times. 

One time I wanted to have my little brothers over, one is 10 and one is 5. I put it on the calendar and told her a week and a day in advance. I asked her to take down the pictures she drew of naked women, hide her bong and rig and put her playboys away. Sleepover day came and she didn’t. I ended up rushing to clean up everything before my step mom, not related to S, came to check the place out. S also decided to invite over 6 of her friends that I’ve never met, one of which brought a big ass pit bull and didn’t tell me. It ran into my room and made me jump but scared tf out of my 5 year old brother. They also were smoking weed in the house. I asked her to stop and she told me “it’s not that big of a deal”. 

About a month ago S and A started seeing each other again. I really didn’t mind I just thought it was weird to be around them considering that I was the one who told the truth to him. So I started staying in my room whenever he was over. But then he started being over EVERY FUCKING DAY. I asked S if A and her were back together and she told me no..? I asked if he was moving back in she told me no...? Why is he over everyday and why are you fucking and still going out? Then that day I got home from the beach with my gf. S isn’t there, I start cleaning. 2 hours later I go to put her beach towels she let me borrow and wash back in her room and went to give back the towels. I open the door and A is just chillin in bed. I also noticed that my missing sheets were on her bed, again, after I told her not to.  I throw the towels on the bed, say sorry, walk out. I text S asking her why she has my sheets, I don’t like the idea of my sheets that I’m sleeping in being the same ones that you’ve fucked multiple dudes on, and why is A here. She said she’d wash the sheets and then played the victim saying I give her anxiety every time I text her about something and that she cant feel comfortable in her own home. I told her the only time I text her is to let her know that she left the back door wide open again even tho the AC is on or that she left all the lights on and left the house again. And I told her that I don’t have a problem with A being here, I’m just not comfortable with him being here when you’re not home. I thought that was reasonable enough. I thought wrong apparently because she hasn’t talked to me since then. I’ve said a few things to her about my social worker coming over or me not gonna be home but she has not initiated a conversation. A has been over every day. And true house is fucking disgusting again So I’m basically trapped in my room because I’m just not comfortable with the mess. I’m not good with confrontation, but I’m fucking angry. I don’t want to hate her because we’re basically family, but I’ve come to resent the hell out of her. She’s a horrible person who can’t even take care of herself. I don’t want to be confined to my room anymore, I have people over and not walk into a messy cluttered house. I don’t even know what to do anymore but I can’t live how I’ve been living the past month for the next two months. What should I do? Any advice is appreciated. 

Also any revenge ideas are also welcomed 

TLDR; my awful roomate/step sister got back with the bf she cheated on, who I told she was cheating and he’s over everyday. She literally never cleans the house and it’s gotten to the point where I’m basically confined in my room. I’m moving out in October but I don’t want to live like this for the next 2 months.",relationship_advice
t3_chg2vs,When did dating become a second stage?,"Like back when I was younger, dating was not exclusive unless stated, and if you were flirting around with a person and going on dates, you were dating. It wasn’t really something that needed stated. 
But I’m noticing now, you “hang out” and after a bit someone will ask the other, and then you are “dating” 

I’m pretty sensitive and like only one person at a time usually, and if I’m “hanging out” usually consider it dating unless we are just friends, but lately I’ve been corrected a lot. That it’s only dating when asked. I thought that asking meant you were going the bf/gf route?

Can someone please explain this?",relationship_advice
t3_chq4wi,How men vs women operate “textually”,"From personal experience and hearing peer experience...I despise the “game” that is texting. The wondering when/if you should reply to someone’s text. How it should be worded. Not replying purposefully. There’s been this plague of thinking that if you respond too quickly to someone, you could be seen as “desperate” or “overly eager”. This idea that “I’m going to purposefully NOT respond which will make them want me more or make me seem not desperate”. God forbid if I text them back quickly enough, they’ll know I have feelings for them!! I feel like with quite a bit of women, it’s more of a “game” vs men. I think most men are so involved with their own lives and texting someone back is not too much of a concern. With that said, it’s frustrating because speaking from experience, women I interact with respond fairly quick over text. As for men, for the most part, respond hours later, if not the next day or not at all. They’ll sometimes leave the conversation completely open. 

This is where confusion lies if a guy is interested in me or not. Are they focused on their own lives/doing their own thing? Because let’s face it...if a guy really wanted to talk to me, he would..right? How does texting on your behalf usually sound/look like if you’re truly interested in a woman?",relationship_advice

t3_chm0s0,My SO thinks I am having a better time with my friends that with her.,"I (23M) rarely get to see my friends as we live in different countries and we get together 3-4 times a year when everyone’s home. My SO (26F) noticed that when I am out with her we go home much earlier than the times I am out with them (Let’s say 00:00 vs 03:00-04:00). I explain this with the fact that I and these people see each other rarely and I am usually against staying up this late but am pressured by them. She says it makes her sad when she is considering the possibility I find her boring.  She says she would rather go home early from a night out with her friends to be with me rather than stay until late (although she agrees she is not that close with her friend group after some irrelevant events a couple years back) We have had more than one conversation about this and although she agrees that you can’t really judge how good a time a person is having by how long they stay out, she simply gets this feeling and cannot switch it off, even though it might be irrational, which I understand.  Am I blind to how I am being hurtful? We live together and I would never even compare my time spent with her to time spent with friends. I am not bored and thoroughly enjoy her company. In addition, what we do when staying out late isn’t wild partying, but just conversation as usually the next day everyone leaves and we don’t meet again for months. She had met these people and has spent time with them, however she does not come out on these night outs as she feels out if place between 5 guys with a common past (last time she was with us for dinner and later she had plans with her family so she had to leave).",relationship_advice
t3_chm0rv,Vent/help?,"I’m sorry the title isn’t a lot to go off. I’m (19F) currently in a long term relationship with my boyfriend (22M) and we have been together for 3 years. Recently I have noticed changes in the way he looks at me and talks to me compared to how he does with his other friends and other women. He seems to be happier around other people than with me, and he seems to enjoy talking to other women more than when talking to me. I feel like he is beginning to get bored or complacent with me and that i no longer excite him or make him feel in love and we are just together because we are used to it. When we are together it feels like I’m just with a good friend, we do have sex still but nowhere near as often as we used to, so when we do have sex it’s really good. I don’t think this is a sex issue.

I’m starting to feel like he’s bored of me even when I make special effort to dress up or to do something nice for him he doesn’t really think twice about it. 

I’ve brought up how I’m feeling to him. He said that I’m the one with the issue and I shouldn’t be constantly looking into things to make a problem out of nothing. This is the first time I’ve really felt like this and I try to brush off small issues as I realise I may be over sensitive sometimes and they are never really an issue. I also got the message that he was implying I was insecure and insecure in this relationship so pretty much turning it all back on me.

I am really in love with him and don’t just want to give up over something that can easily be moved past, I just don’t know how to bring it up to him without him turning it into my issue and getting defensive. 

Me feeling like this has caused issues within myself in the way that I want to meet new people and have fun with people who seem to enjoy my company and want to talk to me and that I make them happy. It’s like I’m seeking attention, especially from men, who can give what my current boyfriend isn’t giving me. I’m starting to have a crush on a certain guy who I have only seen 3 times when I’ve been out with my boyfriend or friends, we have been talking recently (not in any malicious way just as friends and talking about mostly school).

t3_chq41g,[27F] Pre-engagement jitters or correct gut feeling,"I \[27F\] have been with my boyfriend \[26M\] since the final days of high school. We have organically reached a point where engagement is the next natural step. He is very comfortable with the gradual ascend, so are our families. But off late, I find myself struggling with the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to be clear, I absolutely agree with the institution of marriage and this is the man I want to spend my life with.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel insecure &amp; uncertain about formalizing our relationship with a marriage. So many wonderful people get blindsided by cheating partners. People who seem perfectly normal during decade long relationships turn out to be abusers as soon as they get married. I have heard married people say that love flies out the window to make room for complacency &amp; comfort. We don't plan on having a child and statistically couples without children have a higher infidelity/divorce rate. Tying oneself legally would be stupid if things go south. So does \*not\* formalizing it &amp; ending up with nothing overnight if things go south. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm loyal to a fault and have no tolerance for serious lies(even in friendships). Our relationship has been very exciting &amp; romantic all through the years. So all the things listed above are nightmare-ish. I'm not someone who has the strength look past a 'drunk slip up' or find comfort in complacency just to keep the relationship together. I don't even wish to be that person.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm generally very jovial, so I don't know where are this pessimism &amp; insecurity is coming from, and so I don't even know how to handle it. I hate these brand-new doubts but can't seem to put them away. I tried talking to my boyfriend on multiple occasions, but it always ends up with him calling them jitters and reassuring me with sweet words.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if these are merely jitters or my gut trying to warn of me what I can't see just yet. I'm looking for outside perspectives, so your comments are welcomed.

\[Extra info : He is the only guy I've ever dated, while he has had his share of dating experience before we got together and the while we broke up for some time during college. Neither of our parents nor any of my aunts &amp; uncles are divorced. I've had a good childhood. His father used to sometimes hit his mother when he was younger, and it affected him enough to promise himself that he'll never be that man himself.

t3_chq3ru,Me (23 F) and My Girlfriend (25F) are having post ending our LDR growing pains but they're harder than I thought.,"  

My girlfriend and I have been long distance for four years. We moved to a major city and we’ve been living together for about 4 months now and things have been *okay*. I’ve started to realise that we have two different levels of determination. I’m very pedal to the metal and kind of a workhorse. I like to know that my bills are paid, my work is done and that I’m going above and beyond to make sure that I’m meeting my best potential. She on the other hand is comfortable kind of doing the bare minimum and just skirting by. Sometimes she’s not even really skirting by.

She gets GI bill money for school and was kind of living off of that but I know that she might not have it forever and needs to start working toward getting a job in her degree field. She didn’t enroll in classes for the summer on time (even though I’d been nagging her about it) and as a result – she didn’t have a source of income. That’s when she realized that she needed a job (also after I sat on the couch and cried at her for being irresponsible with both of our lives) – even though I’d been nagging her for several months. As such, I’ve been carrying the majority of the bills. She has a job now, but it’s not paying enough for her to actually cover everything, so I’m still footing the most of the bills. 

She comes from a family that didn’t particularly teach her how to be a responsible adult. I have to constantly nag her to take better care of herself, brush your teeth 2x a day, did you get a shower, can you please wash the dishes, can you take the trash out, can you help me fold the laundry etc. I love her to death but I find myself being frustrated by the things that she just *doesn’t do*. She went to the dentist and she’s going to need reparative work in her mouth… close to $1000 worth because she’s not taking good enough care of herself. When I try to tell her that the things she’s doing are detrimental she feels like I’m trying to shame her, or like I feel like “my way is the only right way”. 

I love her, she’s sweet and I feel like she’s been dealt a bad hand. I know for a fact that her parents were not great and didn’t give her the necessary tools to take care of herself, and then scold her when she doesn’t know how to do things in a healthy and responsible manner. I don’t want her to feel like she needs to change for me – she needs to change for herself. My mom is starting to worry that she’s becoming more of a burden on me. I don’t really even know what to do. I don’t know how many times I can lecture her, or how many times I can just grin and bear it and not say ""I told you so"" before I start to lose my mind. I’m not at my wits end now but I’m afraid eventually I will be. I’m afraid that I’m not gonna end up being her girlfriend, I’m gonna end up being her mom. 

I guess I just – I don’t know what to do.",relationship_advice
t3_chfvuq,Should I leave him even he claims he’d kill himself ?,"I’m sorry for the formating but I’m on my mobile. I’m also sorry because this post is going to be long.

So, I (18F) am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (21M) and have been for just a little over a year. However, we see each other pretty regularly. I’m quite at loss with this relationship and I could use advice. I honestly want to leave him but I’m afraid of what he could do to himself.

First of all, my boyfriend is extremely needy. He constantly calls me, wants to spend all of his free time on the phone with me, even if he’s not free and at work. He texts me literally every minute of the day, and double texts me if I don’t answer fast enough. He’s also prompt to get mad if I don’t answer his phonecalls immediatly, and will call me every minute until I answer(his record being 34 phonecalls in a row). He’s also super jealous, and gets suspicious if I don’t answer my phone. He has already called me a liar because I wasn’t answering my phone (I had no battery). He also wants to know where I am constantly, what I’m doing, with who.

He also wants me to constantly reassure him of my love for him. There’s not a phone call where he doesn’t say « Do you love me ? I bet you can’t love as much as I love you » or « Promise me you’ll never leave me ». It makes me uncomfortable, and I voiced it multiple times but he won’t change. He also asks weird questions like « What would you do if I died ? You wouldn’t get back in another relationship, would you ? ». He’s also telling me every minute that he loves me, that I’m the reason he has strength. He calls  me by sweet names every minute.

When we are physically together, he’s super clingy. He wants to hug me all the time, hold me every second. He even wants to hold my hand when we’re eating at a restaurant, which is absolutely not practical. He can’t go a minute without saying « I love you » or calling me baby. He adores PDA, even in front of my parents. I don’t like it and I’ve told him because it embarasses me but he doesn’t see a problem.

I know he has serious abandonment issues, after being emotionally and physically abused by his mom, during his childhood, and then abandonned by her. He also has being cheated on by his ex. I have always listened to him talking about his trauma, but unfortunately, even if I love him, I am not his therapist. I have encouraged him to seek help from a professional but he doesn’t want it. He also uses it as an excuse to manipulate me. Like, if we have a fight, he’s violent emotionally (he has even pushed me violently once), and will after apologize by saying that it’s not his fault, that he’s like this because he had to build his life all by himself and couldn’t count on the emotional support of his parents.

All of this make me suffocate in this relationship. Even though I love him, I want to leave him. I’m not feeling comfortable anymore.

But, he has expressed several times his desire to die if I were to leave him, so I’m truly concerned with what I should do. I honestly love him, and I wish him the best but I just can’t do it anymore.",relationship_advice
t3_chq2rz,"My lack of initiative and tight-fisted attitude in my relationship has put it at breaking point, and I don’t know how to fix it.","I’ve been seeing my girlfriend for ten months now, and over this time she has often complained that I rarely ever make an effort with her, and never take her out on dates or make plans myself. Most of this is fundamentally down to me not wanting to spend excessive money as we are both on a budget and at university, but this attitude has become problematic in our relationship.
I should clarify that she never expects me to pay for everything, and on dates (although few and far between), we always pay half and half. I’ve recently had the realisation that clearly I’m the problem here, and being so complacent and unimaginative in a romantic sense has made matters difficult.

Last night it became too much and she said she does not trust me to change my ways and treat her better, and the most important detail was that I was hesitating on a planned trip to Amsterdam for a few nights to celebrate her birthday; I argued that along with anniversary celebrations and a mandatory course-related field trip I have coming up, I just couldn’t afford it. Realistically, I can, and have savings built up and untouched. I suppose I’d just like to keep it that way, but I’d rather spend a bit and have a fulfilled relationship. 

Ultimately, I just really need advice on how to apologise to her and make things up to her. This is difficult right now especially, because during the summer, this is a long distance relationship and due to some personal views on my family’s side, it is impossible to invite her to my hometown. Sorry if this is a bit convoluted and poorly structured, I just really need to figure out how to win her back. Thanks in advance.",relationship_advice
t3_chq2ak,My (25f) boyfriend's (30m) best friend (33m) is hitting on me and my boyfriend is in denial,"

So my boyfriend Craig has a best friend Eric, they've known each other since they were in college. I didn't ever get along with Eric that great but recently things have gotten worse.

The two of them hang out once or twice a week, oftentimes at the apartment Craig and I share. And Eric seems to be hitting on me, and Craig is in total denial saying Eric is just an outgoing warm guy and he doesn't mean anything by it

He hasn't done anything obvious enough to point a finger at, but it's the sort of situation where little things get picked up as weird, kind of unconsciously. Like seeing someone stare for too long, always want a hug and hold on for longer than is normal, ask questions that toe the line of being too personal, etc.

The breaking point for me was when I was sunbathing on the balcony and I hadn't known Eric was coming over so I was spooked to see him staring at my through the glass doors that opened to the balcony. I yelled at Craig to come over there, and asked to talk to him alone. I said I was getting more and more bothered by his friend, I had been sunbathing and he'd been staring for IDK how long. And unless things changed, I wasn't cool with him being in the apartment.

Craig said he'd talk to Eric and tell him that I wanted to be left alone, and I said that wasn't enough, he should be specific about stuff like him not being welcome back unless he totally stops staring and trying to ask me shit I don't want to answer, and coming around me acting ""friendly"" and shit. 

And he said he wasn't going to say all that, that it was like I was trying to put words in his mouth and end his friendship.

I was so fed up that I booked a spot at a campground and I'm staying there for the time being. But that's not sustainable.

Can I have some advice? How do I get my boyfriend to see his friend is not really a friend to him or our relationship?

tldr - Boyfriend's friend is being weird and flirty around me. It bothers me when that happens in my own home where I just want to feel relaxed. I don't feel like my boyfriend has my back here",relationship_advice

t3_chq0ur,I don't feel like I'm being the best boyfriend for my girlfriend.,"I'm 18 M, she's 19 F.

We've been together for 4 months and I absolutely love everything about her. She's pretty much everything I could want. She loves spending time with me and when she went back home she texted me saying she really loves and misses me and would hate if I died (we were talking about depression and stuff before she left). I'm her first boyfriend, and her first kiss, and she says I'm the only person she has opened up about things with other than her mom.

But I just feel like I haven't been the best boyfriend I could be. I have major depression, ADHD, and sociopathic tendencies and severe insecurity for most of my life. My family describes me as a perfectionist and when things aren't the perfect I can get easily disturbed (even if it's taking a shower, everything has to be laid out perfectly).

My gf is amazing and I just feel like she could do better than me. I'm slowly learning to be more social and it feels like she's holding back her extroverted-ness to match my introvert speed.

I don't know what else to say but I want to say more.

EDIT: Thought of some more: I over-analyze my texting and play it safe with her in fear of her getting annoyed with me. Back in middle school I used to be a very extroverted person, but come high school I realised I was annoying and shut myself in. That's probably part of why I can't express myself and be open.",relationship_advice
t3_chpyvj,How do I (22) get over my gf (24) kissing another guy during our break? TL;DR," **TL;DR**

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so here we go. My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years after one year the distance became long-distance. Reddit, I don't know what else to say, I know people are gonna say it's the typical cheesy story and all that bs. The cheesy stuff is cheesy because it's true. She's smart funny and we love all the same stuff down to the really weird stuff like favorite insane YouTubers and all that. I've always told her communication is key and we've been pretty good about it. On and off for the past two long-distance years, she and I have had stupid, petty fights that we knew were dumb and we would never have in person. In-person we're amazing as well as the distance, I imagine though that it's natural for us to get into these petty fights due to the frustration of being long-distance. That's why we always came back and brushed them off. The thing is Reddit, we had a petty fight last week that reached a place it shouldn't have and then she broke up with me but it was a break up during the heat of the argument that I felt she didn't mean.

We gave each other some space for about a week and then after a week, it was her birthday. I sent her a birthday text and she simply ""loved it"" as in the message and then sent ""thank you, love you too"" I couldn't take it anymore, I texted her and for some reason she just kept telling me to move on and I kept thinking how is it that after a week she's speaking to me like I'm some stranger? Then she proceeded to call herself a shitty person and that I deserve better. I kinda kept pushing with my words as in I just kept kinda asking why she was acting like this and I told her she's the only one for me. She got mad and said I always put her on a pedestal and she's a shitty person and not as great as I think she is. Reddit she and I are good loyal people, and the thing is, her life after she had to move is not a great one, she graduated, moved away from all her friends, she is now working two jobs and paying off loans, her parents are always fighting and her dad is a very strict and religious dad who basically doesn't let her have a life at all. She even told me how she thinks she's a shitty person because of how much she's lied to her dad and the reason she lies to him is about stuff like going out and all that. Her dad is a control freak and that was something we also bonded over, our parents never let us do anything in high school and in college, we only got a smaller amount of freedom opposed to that. She has very few friends and yeah barely ever hangs out with those friends as it is. She is constantly paranoid of her dad finding out about us. It's messed up because sadly her household is one where the dad's approval is what matters, her mother and sisters know about me and love me. This made her love for me even stronger.

After I texted and pushed her enough because I was so confused and not about to let it end like that, she finally came out and sent a long text that started out with ""I let another guy kiss me"" she said she regretted it the second it happened, she only has feelings for me, she felt like shit, she's disgusted with herself and hates herself, and she was questioning how could I be with someone like her. Reddit idk if anyone else feels this way but the last fucking thing I wanted to know were the details but I still had to ask for some sort of closure, I asked how and where did it happen, she said he snagged one from her just before she and her girl friend were leaving. I asked how long it was and all that crap and she said not long but she wanted to stop talking about it because it made her feel gross. I respected that and I told her that it was ok, it was just a kiss. She doubts that I'm this calm with it but she said she hopes I keep true to my promises and never bring it up or any of that. Guys, I love her so much and she's living and incredibly hard life out there, and technically she and I were broken up for a week and it happened about two days before I texted her again and we had this conversation. Reddit I feel like I made the right decision but how do I get the thoughts of this asshole kissing her? He's into her and she said she's not going to entertain him or let him believe he has any chances. How do I get myself over this one little kiss? She's going through a lot and the last thing I want to do is dump her and make her mental health even more unstable than it is. I don't want to break up with her, she's the one for me, but how do I get this one little kiss out of my head? How do I stop letting these thoughts take over? I can't stop the paranoid thoughts of her maybe secretly enjoying that kiss? I can't stop thinking about how trust was kind of broken but I guess technically we were broken up, it's obviously just irritating because it was literally five days after we broke up and we usually come back to one another. She said she let him kiss her but he kinda just went for it and caught her off guard, she didn't insinuate it or anything. In her long text she kept telling me how awful she felt and that she recognizes how I only want her but she was having slight doubts about us and then after that she asked me how could I want to be with someone like that? This isn't something that I ever thought we would have to deal with. I know that technically trust isn't broken, she once felt guilty and facetimed me one day about a work party the night before where a guy tried to get a kiss from her but she backed off and said she has a bf. She facetimed me telling me that and said she didn't want to keep anything which tells me I should trust what she said about this guy. I feel so powerless, I just wanna punch that guy because I can't get over how smirky he must feel for snagging a kiss like that when I'm almost sure he knows about us, maybe he doesn't idk. Guys what do I do, I don't want to let her go and she doesn't want me to either, I handled the situation in a mature manner but that was through texting, texting doesn't show my inner thoughts.

I want to do something special for my 3 monthiversary with my girlfriend on Friday and I don’t know what to do. This summer I have already: taken her to the movies, had a picnic in the park, gone on a hike, and taken her to a farmers market with a petting zoo. I want to do something that we haven’t done before. I’m picking her up at 3:30 on Friday and we’ll have until around 7. Let me know if you have any ideas, thanks so much!",relationship_advice
t3_chpwms,My friend is constantly passive-aggressive,"I (18F) have known this girl (20F) for 6 years, and we were very close at first. I considered her my best friend. We talked every day, and we were sincerely happy with each other. She was always supportive. We are both very introverted and at the time she had no other friends than me. I had, on my side, but she remained my number 1.

For 2-3 years, our friendship has clearly deteriorated. Before that, we had never argued, and I could express myself naturally with her, talk about anything and everything without worrying about her reactions. Today, every conversation, on any subject, is hijacked.

 For example, today I told her about that american city I like a lot (we are European), and she replied that what I said was abberant and that I did'nt know anything about this city, that it interested me only because of the pictures, landscapes, and what people are saying on the internet, and that I had to go there to find out. She said that America doesn't interest her and that it was stupidly overrated. From my point of view, it was an innocent and enthusiastic remark about something that interested me, I never claimed to be an expert. This example is gentle compared to others.

I won't give other examples so that the post won't be too long, but it's necessary to know that each discussion turns out badly. All. I'm not exaggerating. She contradicts everything I say, every day, when I'm happy about something or interested she breaks my joy by brandishing only bad sides, or by making me understand that it doesn't interest her, therefore it's stupid.

When I'm complaining about something and looking for emotional support she tells me it's my fault, defends the thing that annoys me, and tells me what to do.

I have already tried to talk to her several times (3 or 4 times), trying several methods. I was sweet, I was direct and straightforward , I sent her a YouTube video of Anna Akana clearly explaining why her attitude was putting our friendship at risk.

Each time, it turned against me. She has no trouble insulting me (it happens very rarely but it happened), criticize me, make me look like an idiot, but she can not question herself. It never happened. Never. In 6 years. She never apologized, and when she is wrong about something she is a victim. ""You're very rude right now, you're hurting my feelings,"" and then she stops answering for several days. I took the blame and apologized several times just to maintain peace. 

I'm having a hard time supporting this situation and even when I'm doing my best to avoid the conflict, it appears in every conversation. I feel more and more stupid by talking to her. I know that I am very naive, but I am young and I constantly question myself. My self esteem is diminishing from days to days.

Some information I did not know where to place:

-I had a depression in high school, and I was completely isolated. After high school, I took a sabbatical year which isolated me even more (I hardly go out anymore) and I start college next year, and figure skating to be invested in something. I have absolutely no friends. I do not talk to anyone outside of her, and I would like to arrange things with that person whom I once considered my best friend.


-She never confides to me. She asks me to tell her all my life and my feelings in detail but when I return the question she refuses to answer. In the end by keeping   everything for her she becomes frustrated and passive aggressive, which falls on me (my theory). 

What can I do to save this friendship? 

PS: I'm new on reddit and this is my very first post, sorry if I did some mistakes. I'm still learning English so it's not perfect. I hope it is still understandable.

t3_chlv3l,"Help, not sure if being abused","So a bit of background I have been dating my boyfriend for 4 years. 

For the most part things are fine, we happily spend time together and share common interests. He actually recently splurged on me for my birthday. But the problem is the little things.

For example, he is incapable of apologising to me if we have a fight. When I say that he has upset me, the best I get is 'I'm sorry you feel that way'. He also will not accept any responsibility for wrongdoing. When I point it out he shuts down and will ask to not talk for a few days. When I call him out on my feeling that I cannot share my issues with him, he won't talk about it and will sleep on the couch, as if to prove my point. the last time I raised this he said it was because I had spent all day in the house and was obviously depressed.

I'm currently sick at the moment and he has said that I need to cook dinner for myself and made remarks when he thought I had left dishes for him to do. If he's sick I wait on him hand and foot.

He will bang on about how he loves me more, but won't sit down and talk to me. I have caught him not listening to a word I have said on multiple occasions but he calls me a liar when I say that I had in fact told him something. He's so worked up about that he now often 'file notes' our arguments.

He's an incredibly smart man but I sometimes feel as though he holds that over me, despite the fact we have the same degrees and jobs. He's also a golden child in his parents eyes, so I feel a lot of this may come down to how he has been raised.

The thing also is, he doesn't exactly take no for an answer. I mean, he will just grab me then expect sex or after he finishes once he expects me to keep going. Because I've just had an injury I am often not in the mood and instead of respecting that he will touch hinself in front of me and even follow me around the house continuing to touch hinself, begging me to touch him, until I say yes. I have broken down crying before because I don't feel respected, which is met with the 'I'm sorry you feel that way'.

He also does not believe my injury is severe as it is and will sigh loudly when I say I can't do something.

Despite all of the above, he can be very selfless and thoughtful. We are often in a very happy place but when any of the above happen it makes me doubt my whole relationship.

t3_chpuod,I [M20] recently started seeing someone [19F] but I am about to leave the country soon.,"Hi, first post here, so sorry for poor format or anything else that I mess up. 

This summer I stated an internship about 2 hours away from my normal home. I live here Monday-Friday and then drive home on the weekends to see my family and friends. In the beginning of the summer I matched with a girl (we will call her Jane) on Tinder and have been talking daily ever since. Due to the fact that I work during the day for 8 hours, Jane works mainly at night, and I have been driving home on the weekends has made it really difficult to find a time that works for the both of us to hang out. Last week we got dinner together and this week we have already spent two nights doing stuff together and plan to do something again on either Saturday or Sunday. 

Another important aspect is that I am leaving the country in about 3 weeks for almost 15 days. And once I return she will have already left for college and I will be starting the semester soon as well. 

I am definitely starting to develop feelings for her and believe that she is doing the same for me. But, we both go to college and our schools are about 2.5 hours apart, so it isn't an impossible distance to make work out but I have never been in a long distance relationship and I'm nervous that it might not work out because we have only spent a little time together in person even though we have been messaging each other for over a month now. Jane has said to me that the time we have spent together in person has been really fun and has enjoyed it a lot.

Last night after our date I told Jane I never intended to develop feelings but I have started to and want to hang out with her more. She never specifically stated she had more feelings but did say that she wanted to spend more time together before I leave the country in 3 weeks. So it seems to me like there is definitely something between us, but the fact that I am leaving the country and then for school makes me hesitant because I don't want to establish strong feelings when they could lead to nothing. 

I also don't wanna be too pushy and force anything either. Any advice on what I should do in regards to handling this? ",relationship_advice
t3_chn0oo,TL;DR Plus Size Lingerie recommendations?,"I (24F) am going to spend my first weekend with my long distance girlfriend (30F) in 2 weeks. We have never had an overnight visit and have not had sex yet. That is the plan for this visit. I have also just never had sex with a woman in general. She mentioned that she will be bringing “a few lacy pieces” that she can’t wait for me to see. I don’t have any, and have never even looked for lingerie. I am nervous because I am a bit bigger than her, but I want to wear something pretty for her too. I just don’t know where to start. I would be too self conscious to go into an actual store to shop. Does anyone have any recommendations for places online to buy plus size lingerie?
